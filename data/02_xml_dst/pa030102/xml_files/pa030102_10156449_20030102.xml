<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to fluid flowmeters, and more particularly, to a substantially unitary-bodied fluoropolymer flowmeter capable of employing various component and float configurations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Flowmeters are utilized in many different industries to measure and control the flow of various fluids. Flowmeters generally utilize moveable float members in the fluid flow stream for the measurement of pressure drops across an orifice in the fluid flow stream. These flowmeters generally have electrical circuits and readouts that provide highly accurate measurements of flow rates. Due to their complexity, reliability and maintenance are issues, as is cost. A mechanically simple and highly reliable flowmeter utilizes an upright tube that allows for visual gauging of volumetric flow rates through the monitoring of marked indicia on the sight flow tube itself, or other connection means. The sight tube will have a pair of fittings at each end of the sight tube for connection to and insertion into a fluid flow circuit. A &ldquo;float&rdquo; is denser than the fluid being measured, is visible through the sight tube, and rises up the tube as the flow rate increases. The flow rate is visually indicated by the position of the float in the sight tube. Typical floats are generally shaped as balls, spherical objects, and other non-elongate members designed to move freely in the sight tube or to be guided along a guide rod securely mounted within the sight tube. Such conventional float designs generally function sufficiently in measuring medium to high fluid flow rates through a flowmeter. However, in certain industries, such as semi-conductor processing, low and ultra-low fluid flow rates are often required during processing. The measurement of these reduced flow rates through a fluid flowmeter must be accurately indicated to ensure processing efficiency and precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Even known float assemblies in the industry having a generally elongate float, which are designed to meter low fluid flow rates, are deficient. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in particular, a prior art flowmeter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> having a tapered elongate float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and sight tube <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> system is utilized wherein the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is guided through guides <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. This system is intended to meter low fluid flow rates. The float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> comprises a tapered section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> that ends approximately central to the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> at a ledge <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Lateral float movement is controlled with the use of bottom guides <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and top guides <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The taper of the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> increases from one end proximate the guides <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to the ledge <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. As the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is forceably moved upward with fluid pressure through the sight tube <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, it progresses upward until the ledge <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> engages the top guides <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. With a reduction in fluid flow, the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> returns downward until being stopped by the tapering effect of the tapered section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Such a system has an innate drawback in that stopping of the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> with the tapered section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> within the bore or channel of guides <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can cause an undesirable wedging effect. This innate characteristic is particularly unacceptable when measuring low flow rates. Namely, the tapered section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can become measurably stuck within the guides <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> such that a higher level of flow is required to initiate forceable movement of the float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> within the tube <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Since low flow rates are the focus of such a flowmeter, this can serve to decrease reliability and accuracy, especially for the periods of fluid flow prior to dislodging of the wedged float <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. In fact, this may completely prevent fluid flow metering for ultra-low fluid flows through the flowmeter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the processing of semi-conductor wafers into integrated circuits, highly corrosive, ultra-pure fluids, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric and hydrofluoric acid, are in extreme temperature ranges and are utilized. These fluids not only damage traditional flowmeter materials, but they additionally impose significant health risks for personnel exposed to the fluids during the manufacturing process. Moreover, the equipment and materials in contact with these ultra-pure fluids must not contaminate or add impurities to the fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, semi-conductor processing applications require flowmeter construction providing accurate fluid flow measurements at varying fluid flow rates, while at the same time utilizing highly inert materials that withstand the potential damaging effects of these corrosive fluids, that do not contaminate the fluids, and that tolerate the broad temperature ranges. Moreover, the design of such flowmeters must minimize fluid leakage pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Prior art flowmeters have addressed the problems associated with the use of corrosive fluids in flowmeters by using highly inert corrosive-resistant plastics in the construction of components of the flowmeters. Fluoropolymers such as perfluoroalkoxy resins (PFA), polytetrafluoroethylenes (PTFE), and ethylenetetrafluoroethylenes (ETFE) are plastics that are suitable for use with these corrosive fluids. The translucent-transparency characteristics of thin-walled PFA is typically utilized in the construction of the sight tube of these flowmeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,832 (the &apos;832 patent) is an example of a flowmeter device where fluoropolymers are utilized. This specific device discloses a fluoropolymer housing flowmeter that places two cavities in the flow tube region where pressure sensors are placed for accurately measuring fluid flow rates. The rectangular housing and cover for this invention are constructed of non-translucent PTFE and the cover is mounted to the housing with screws, with a gasket positioned in between the two in an attempt to minimize fluid leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,078,004, 5,381,826, and 5,549,277 are examples of fluoropolymer flowmeters utilizing sight tubes where a limited portion of the flowmeter is made of PFA material. In such flowmeters, the centrally located sight tube can be machined from PFA, with additional fitting components machined from PTFE, or other non-translucent materials, which are connected directly to the ends of the sight tube, or connected in series with those parts that do have a direct association with the PFA sight tube. Generally, each of these components are attached to each other and/or the sight tube via threaded portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These currently available fluoropolymer flowmeter devices, whether they be conventional sight tube flowmeters or other flowmeters, contain disadvantages centering mainly around the materials used and the methods of assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Generally fluoropolymers, particularly PTFE, are not conducive to injection molding processes. As a result, in the known commercial sight tube fluoropolymer flowmeters, such as the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each component is machined to obtain the desired shapes, tolerances, and the requisite threaded connections. Machining adds very significant labor costs to the production of the devices and, to the extent possible, should be avoided. Moreover, multi-component flowmeter assemblies utilizing threaded portions present potential fluid leakage pathways. The possibility of fluid leakage is increased with each non-unitary connection between components. For instance, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the flowmeter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes at least a first fitting <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and a second fitting <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> that are threadably attached, at threaded portions <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, to the tapered sight tube <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, thus increasing the potential for unacceptable leakage. Further, the sight tube <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is likely constructed of translucent PFA, while the fittings <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are constructed of a material such as PTFE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Ideally, flowmeters, particularly those utilized in handling corrosive-caustic fluids, should have a minimum number of non-unitary connections that do utilize the process of threadingly joining molded flowmeter components, namely the fittings to the sight tube. The manufacturing process for the so-called unitary-bodied flowmeters constructed of conventional plastics generally involves the affixation of a plug or cap to a body portion. The affixation processes known for these conventional plastic sight tube flowmeters involve adhesive bonding and ultrasonic welding. Ultrasonic welding involves vibrating or oscillating a first plastic component with respect to a second plastic component that it is in engagement with the first plastic component. Such welding is not effective for joining tubular end portions. Moreover, due to the &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; nature of fluoropolymers, forms of vibrating or oscillating bonding is not realistic. Similarly, adhesives do not work on fluoropolymers, and would only add potential contaminants which must be avoided in semi-conductor processing applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although PFA is substantially more expensive then PTFE (perhaps 10-15 times as expensive) it is considered to have great advantages over PTFE. Namely, PFA is cleaner, providing less contaminants than PTFE. Further, and unlike PTFE, PFA can be injection molded and homogeneously joined with like materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Homogeneously joining by welding separate fluoropolymers components, such as PTFE, is essentially impossible. In comparison, PFA components may be welded together utilizing non-contact heating as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,293, assigned to Fluoroware, Inc., also the owner of the instant application. It is believed that these welding techniques have never, before this invention, been utilized in association with the manufacture of a fluoropolymer flowmeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> All of the discussed prior art falls short of adequately addressing the unique accuracy, purity, and low fluid flow needs of the semi-conductor processing industry. The prior art does not address the need for coupling the benefits PFA offers in resisting corrosion with the advantages a unitary-bodied component construction advances with regard to leakage prevention and reduced manufacturing and assembly costs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the flowmeter of the present invention substantially solve the problems innately present with conventional fluid flowmeters. These needs are addressed by introducing a corrosive-resistant flowmeter made of a material such as PFA where reliability and effectiveness are increased while manufacturing costs can be reduced in one embodiment by utilizing a unitary-bodied component construction. Further, the a functional component design that enables accurate and efficient readings and indications of reduced fluid flow rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a sight tube flowmeter is formed of a plurality of fluoropolymer components welded together to form a unitary flowmeter body. The components can comprise a PFA upright sight tube having two end portions, a flow conduit extending therethrough and two fitting portions that are uniquely welded onto each end of the sight tube, and a fluoropolymer float device movable to various positions within the flow conduit depending on the flow level of the fluid flowing therethrough. The float device can be of conventional design or for those flowmeter embodiments where low fluid flow rates are to be measured, an elongate float can be utilized. The floats and, in particular, a designated portion thereof, are visible through the sight tube to provide visual indication of the position, and thus the flow rate of fluid flowing through the flowmeter. In addition, alternative embodiments include the implementation of the unique sight tube and elongate float design in conventional flowmeters not having a unitary-bodied configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> At least one of the fittings may include a valve assembly to control the flow rate of the fluid. The invention also includes the process of manufacturing the flowmeter, in particular the steps of injection molding PFA components and welding the PFA components to form a unitary flowmeter body. In one embodiment of the process the components are welded using a noncontact heater to melt the PFA portions to be welded, wherein the portions are then brought into contact with each other and held until the PFA cools and solidifies. A curing step involving baking at least one of the PFA flowmeter components on a jig, may also be added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that the entire flowmeter body can be of a unitary construction. Threaded connections between the sight tube and the sight tube end connections are eliminated. This minimizes potential leakage pathways, lessens potential hazards to personnel, and lowers manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A further feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that machining of component parts of the flowmeter is substantially, or even entirely, eliminated. This, in turn, can lower labor and manufacturing costs, and the end cost of the flowmeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that the body is manufactured entirely of PFA which is cleaner and exposes the metering process to less contamination. This is essential in the semiconductor processing field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Still another feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that the entire body can be measurably translucent. Translucent characteristics provide for increased visibility of the component positions such as a valve member and float, and provide increased visibility of any contaminants that may be present within any portion of the flowmeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A further feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that it can be an injection molded flowmeter that is inert and chemically resistant to the chemicals utilized in semiconductor wafer processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that the design of the elongate float coupled with the shape and construction of the conduit within the sight tube cam permit an increase in metering accuracy for low and ultra-low fluid flow rates through the flowmeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that the sight tube and elongate float design of the present invention can be implemented in those conventional flowmeters that are not unitary-bodied to increase measurement of low and ultra-low fluid flow rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Still another feature and advantage of an embodiment of the invention is that the welding of multiple components or parts together to form a unitary-bodied flowmeter can increase the possibilities and efficiencies of adjusting and modifying the structural configuration of the three main weldable components of the flowmeter. Modifications can be efficiently focused on only those components where it is needed such that molding and manufacturing processes for the entire flowmeter are not unnecessarily disrupted or altered. For instance, design and functional changes can be narrowly directed to the sight tube and float assembly if desired.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one embodiment of a unitary-bodied flowmeter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The flowmeter can be a welded assembly of injection molded fluoropolymer plastic components, generally PFA components or fluoropolymers having translucent qualities, wherein at least two of the three main body components are joined through a compactable welding process. Other fluoropolymer plastics are also envisioned for component and part use in the flowmeters in accordance with the present invention. For example, but not for limiting purposes, PTFE, ETFE, and other plastics are envisioned. The translucent characteristics of the preferred fluoropolymers can vary in the degree to which it is translucent, such that translucent characteristics permit gauging of a float device within the sight tube, as will be discussed in detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally comprises the joining of at least two of three main body components into a unitary flowmeter body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Unitary-bodied can mean the joining two of the three main body components to the third component through a weldment bond (discussed herein) such that two of components are initially molded as one piece. For instance, one molded piece could comprise of the second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, with the first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> being later welded or otherwise joined with the available end of the sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that at least one of the three main body components is constructed of a translucent fluoropolymer for preferred embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The three main body components are first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Once each component is positionally joined to properly form the unitary flowmeter body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as will be explained in detail, body conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed which provides a flow channel beginning with and running through first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, continuing through sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and running through and out of the end of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> First fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generally comprises an entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an exiting end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, these ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are generally in a perpendicular relationship to each other. A first fitting conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> defines an inner bore of some diameter within first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, traveling along the longitudinal axis of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the entire distance beginning with entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and ending with exiting end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. First fitting conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> results in first fitting openings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at each end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Known fittings, connectors, and other devices known to one skilled in the art for connecting to sight tubes and other components of flowmeters are envisioned for first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises a generally cylindrical tube with first fitting end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and second fitting end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> running through it so that an inner bore of some diameter generally larger than the inner diameters of first fitting conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is defined. Tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> traverses the longitudinal axis of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the entire distance of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that sight tube openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed at each of the ends <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The diameter of tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can gradually taper the distance of the tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that the diameter at second fitting end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is larger than the diameter at first fitting end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. While preferred embodiments are generally cylindrical with visual gauging characteristics, other shapes and constructions for the tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are envisioned without deviating from the unitary characteristic of the flowmeter in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the outer surface of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can comprise flow indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This flow indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> generally consists of molded or etched marks depicting specific volumetric flow rate information for use in visual gauging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can comprise a generally hourglass-shaped tube with a first fitting end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and second fitting end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> running through it to permit fluid flow communication between the first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is generally divided into three fluid flow channels or conduits: an entry conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, an exit conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and an intermediate narrowed channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The portion proximate the center of the hourglass sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the inner tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> defines a division between the entry conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the exit conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and defines the intermediate narrowed channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The intermediate narrowed channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serves as the communication channel between the conduits <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and is some size smaller in diameter and cross-section than conduits <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the diameter of entry conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> gradually tapers such that the diameter at the portion of the conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> proximate the first fitting end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is larger than the diameter proximate the intermediate channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the exit conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is substantially consistent along its length, with only a diameter increase or tapered effect at the end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> connectable to and in communication with the second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the diameter or cross-section of intermediate channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is generally consistent along its entire length, but could be varied. Tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> traverses the longitudinal axis of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the entire distance of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through conduit/channels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that a continuous fluid flow path is established and sight tube openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed at each of the ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the outer surface of the hour-glass shaped sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also comprises flow indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This flow indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> generally consists of molded or etched marks depicting specific volumetric flow rate information for use in visual gauging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For each of the preferred embodiments, second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> generally takes the form of a T-shaped fitting comprising entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and valve end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is generally perpendicular to exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and valve end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and valve end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> sharing a common linear plane, with the shared linear plane intersecting the linear plane of entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so that the longitudinal axis of entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is nearly positioned at the center of the distance between the far ends <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> traversing the longitudinal axis of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that an inner bore of some diameter is defined. Second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> traverses the entire distance of entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and valve end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> begins at entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and traverses toward the herein described plane intersection where it opens into and is one continuous shared channel with the portion of second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> traversing the entire distance between exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and valve end. <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Known fittings, connectors, and other devices known to one skilled in the art for connecting to sight tubes and other components of flowmeters are envisioned for first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments, such as the flowmeters shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, regardless of the sight tube and float assembly configurations, the flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be constructed without a valve device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In those embodiments having a valve device, second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at valve end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can define valve member opening <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Valve member opening <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be internally threaded some distance from valve end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> inward toward exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This threading is designed for receiving a threaded valve assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Such valve devices are best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Valve assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> comprises valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> comprises a first end portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and can have a threaded portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> affixes to the first end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> via a valve aperture <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which traverses some longitudinal distance not equal to the entire length of the valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment having external threading, threaded portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is capable of threadably engaging internal threading in second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such that the assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and particularly the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, can be adjustably moved in and out of the opening <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Other means of moving such a valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in and out of such an opening known to one skilled in the art are also envisioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> portion can include a valve needle protrusion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or extension shaped for insertion in and out of compatible area of the opening <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the relative linear movement of the valve assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The valve needle <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be tapered or non-tapered, depending on the sealing performance desired, and the particular manufacturing requirements or limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Generally, in those flowmeters <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilizing a valve assembly, valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is affixed to valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> via a snapping means, as shown best in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The snapping means comprises the valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, valve shaft groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and valve top groove <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Valve shaft groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is located distal the valve needle <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> end of the shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, begins some distance inward from the end opposite to the valve needle <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> end, and travels the entire outer circumference of the shaft with the recess of valve shaft groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> recessed into the shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> some distance. Valve top groove <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is located at the end of valve aperture <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and is designed to receive valve shaft groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that the valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> become interlocked in a rotationally limiting manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments can use other means of affixing valve top portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the valve shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. These alternative embodiments can include fasteners such as screws or bolts. Single piece molding of valve top portion and valve shaft portion together is also an available embodiment. As stated, yet other embodiments can exclude any valve assembly at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Various known or inventive float assemblies can be employed with the flowmeter of the present invention. For instance, a spherical float or an elongate float and corresponding assemblies can be employed without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For those flowmeter embodiments utilizing a spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, float assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is contained within sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Such a float assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> comprises spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, and resting apertures <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> further comprises a float bore <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> that intersects substantially the center of float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and defines the receiving channel for insertion of the guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The diameter of float bore <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is some size larger than the outside diameter of guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. Guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is generally a small diameter cylindrical rod with a first and second end. The outside diameter of guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is significantly smaller than the diameter of tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> centrally traverses the entire distance of the tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, traversing completely through float bore <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is rested securely in its final assembled position when the first and second ends of guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> travel into and rest within resting apertures <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Resting apertures <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be located within an area inside the first fitting conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and second fitting conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The inside diameter of resting apertures <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are some size larger than the outside diameter of guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> so that selective insertion and removal of guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> from resting apertures <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For those flowmeter embodiments utilizing an elongate float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, referring primarily to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, float assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is within sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the completed assembly of flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Float assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> generally comprises an elongate float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and at least one float guide stop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably has a circular cross-section, but can also take on a myriad of other shapes, such as triangular, rectangular, oval, variations thereof, and the like. The elongate float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably tapered for some length of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Generally, the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is tapered such that the diameter or cross-section of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> gradually increases until it reaches an integrated float flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The flange can have bores, notches, or like features to enable fluid flow through a portion of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to control the movement sensitivity of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. While the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is generally cylindrical, it can take on various other shapes as well. In one embodiment the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is located at an end of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is located proximate the center portion of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, but can be located anywhere along the length of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The outside diameter, or the cross-section, of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at the widest or largest portion is substantially smaller than that of either conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> but is minimally smaller than the width or cross-section of channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The float guider <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can take the form of at least one guide <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and/or at least one guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The guides <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be rectangular, oval, circular, spherical or a myriad of other shapes. The guides <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can include a plurality of bores to permit fluid flow, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The guide stops <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are preferably of a T-shaped cross-section and can also include a plurality of guide stop bores <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to permit fluid flow, as best shown in the cross-section view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The T-shaped form is substantially defined by the extension of a guide stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> can be of varying lengths. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an embodiment implementing a relatively long stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Mounting needs and locations for the guide stops <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and a litany of other factors will influence the length. A receiving bore <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is generally included which is some size larger than the diameter of the portion of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> it is designed to receive. The receiving bore <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> generally traverses the longitudinal axis of the stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to completely penetrate the guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is generally smaller than the diameter or cross-section of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> such that contact or abutment of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> against the proximate end of the stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> will limit the upward movement of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> within exit conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, as shown best in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, there are a plurality of float guiders <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> within the sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In particular, two guides <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> having a guide bore <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are fixed within the entry conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a single guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, with or without a protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, is fixed within the exit conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Both guide/stops <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> can be fixed at the end of the corresponding conduits <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, or fixed some distance inward of the ends <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, there can simply be one guide <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, with at least one bore shaped and located such that it is capable of receiving the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and restricting lateral movement in much the same manner as if two guides were implemented. The flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is preferably located at a region proximate one end of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with such an embodiment, with said end of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> being greater in cross-section or diameter than the distal end. The largest diameter cross-section of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at the tapered end is still some size smaller than the diameter of channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to facilitate free movement through the channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The diameter or cross-section of the flange is larger than that of the proximate portion of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to limit upward movement against the stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and the protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in particular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If there are a plurality of guides <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, then they are fixedly spaced some distance from each other such that a guide channel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is created. The portion of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> traveling within this channel distance is small enough so that it can move freely without binding or wedging, while at the same time limiting lateral movement of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> within the entry conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> single guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is utilized and fixed within the exit conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Movement of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is significantly limited to a region within conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and thus lateral movement within conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not a concern, and a guide <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may not be needed. Accordingly, the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is located some distance along the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> away from the ends. Preferably, the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is proximate the center region of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in such an embodiment. At a lower region of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the tapering gets smaller as it moves away from the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, while the cross-section of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> remains substantially constant for the region approaching the opposite end or upper region above the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The tapered end below the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at its largest diameter is still some size smaller than the diameter of channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The non-tapered end of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is generally sized smaller than the receiving bore <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and can be moved in and out of the bore until stopped by contact with the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> against the guide stop protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> While the elongate float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> described herein has been described with a unitary-bodied flowmeter, the elongate float and sight tube components and configurations detailed are also envisioned for use with conventional flowmeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring generally to the processes shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a process of manufacture of one embodiment of the unitary-bodied flowmeter in accordance with the present invention involves the following steps: first, designated PFA, or similarly at least translucent fluropolymer, components used in the manufacturing of the flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are injection molded in a mold <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with a retractable insert <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This injection molding process permits the construction and shaping of thin PFA tubular components in order to achieve the desired result with regard to component translucence, which is particularly important with respect to the sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each of the three body components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be molded separately to be welded as described herein, or at least two of the components can be molded as a single component to be welded with the final component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Following the injection molding process, each designated PFA component is baked in an oven <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at a temperature range of approximately 300&deg; F. to 500&deg; F., forming the PFA components into their final sizes and construction for joining to form the final unitary-bodied flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The PFA components can shrink substantially during the baking process. This injection molding and baking can be adjusted greatly with various jigs and other manufacturing processes and tools. As stated, various component configurations and combinations can be implemented. Further, component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> shapes and sizes can be altered or re-designed while still leaving the remaining components untouched. This allows focused re-configuration to reduce manufacturing costs. For instance, if the manufacturer is desirous of changing only the configuration of the sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such a change can be made without altering the configurations of the fittings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, once the components have been properly injection molded and baked, final joining of the components into a unitary-bodied fluoropolymer flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is possible. Generally, at least two of the three main body components, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are non-contact welded together creating a weldment bond <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. For instance, first fitting end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be non-contact welded to exiting end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, creating a weldment bond <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further, second fitting end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be non-contact welded to entering end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Details of such non-contact welding are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,293 which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, other non-contaminating techniques and methods of bonding the fluoropolymer components known to one skilled in the art can be employed as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring primarily to FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the non-contact welding and manufacturing process for one spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> embodiment is shown. Float assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for the spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> embodiment is calibrated prior to the joining or welding of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a previously joined assembly of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is positioned in the juncture of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> rests at the resting aperture <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> integral to first fitting conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A calibration guide rod <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is positioned through the float into the guide rod aperture <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that it extends upwardly. A calibration fitting <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> engages the top opening of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The calibration guide rod <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is received by the fitting <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The calibration fitting <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is temporarily sealingly attached to sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is removed upon completion of the calibration process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Fluid, typically water, is forced into entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, traveling through first fitting conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and into the tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where it forces float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> up guide rod <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> some distance depending on the applied flow rate. Spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is replaced with others of different size, shape, or weight until the desired flow readings are obtained consistent with actual flow rates provided by calibration circulator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Once calibration readings are ideal, the calibration fixture <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and guide rod <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are removed, guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is inserted through aperture <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in place of the calibration guide rod <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and aperture <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is sealed by heating and pinching the boss <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</cross-reference>, the non-contact welding and manufacturing process for an elongate float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> embodiment is shown. Assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is generally calibrated prior to the joining of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the already joined assembly of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Fluid, typically water, is forced into entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, traveling through first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and into sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where it forces float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> up body conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is replaced with others of different size, shape, or weight until the desired flow readings are obtained consistent with actual flow rates provided by calibration circulator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Various low and ultra-low rates can be easily metered with such precision calibration. Once calibration readings are ideal, the calibration fixture is removed. In addition, aperture <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is generally sealed by heating and pinching the boss <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> With calibration complete, on either float assembly embodiments, the next step generally consists of joining second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by non-contact welding second fitting end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to entering end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. However, as stated herein, it is envisioned that non-contact welding could be implemented to attach or bond only two of the three main body components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Completion of the assembly and calibration processes results in the final flowmeter body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> assembly with body conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> consisting of a continuous flow channel beginning with entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, continuing through sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and running through and out of exiting end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> opening of second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> During operation of the flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a generally elongate float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, fluid is introduced into entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As the fluid traverses through the conduit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> it puts anti-gravitational pressure on float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which has a gravitational bias. The vertical force of the fluid consequently moves float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> upward closer to second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In preferred elongate float embodiments having a flange, the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> begins in an initial seat or rest position against the region where the upper portion of channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the lower portion of conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> join. In this initial seated position, the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> substantially closes off fluid communication through channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and thus measurably restricts fluid from entering into conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In conventional flowmeter float designs, a relatively significant amount of vertical fluid force is needed to counter the gravitational bias of the float. In the present invention, however, the fluid flow required to move the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is significantly reduced. This is possible because of the initial closed position of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> against the channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the narrowing distance provided by the narrow channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Fluid force builds up rather easily behind the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> since there is substantially no room between the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the proximate walls of the channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This reduced fluid travel space coupled with the inability of the fluid to travel past the blockage created by the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> creates a highly sensitive configuration where fluid metering of low fluid flow is possible. Fluid pressure behind the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is easily created despite low or ultra low fluid flows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As the low flowing fluid builds up within the channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and against the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will move correspondingly. Because of the relative narrowness of the channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the reduced size of conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in comparison to conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, fluid pressure on the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will continue despite consistent low or ultra-low fluid flow rates within the body conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> even after the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has moved some distance upward beyond its initial seated position against the opening of channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Once the vertical force of the fluid is equal to that of the gravitational bias of float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, vertical movement will stabilize. If not, movement of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> upward will continue until the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> abuts the guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, or protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The distance between the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in its resting position, and the protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> can be adjusted by altering the length of the conduit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, adjusting the length of the protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the fixed location of the guide stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and like techniques and configurations. Indications of the fluid flow rates can be measured by metering a portion of the float <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> against the marked or etched indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the sight tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Preferably, flow rates can be measured according to the alignment of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in relationship to the indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Needed adjustments to fluid flow rates can be made based on the obtained flow readings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> During operation of the flowmeter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employing a generally spherical float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, fluid is introduced into entering end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of first fitting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As the fluid traverses through the body conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into tube conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> it puts and anti-gravitational pressure on float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which has a gravitational bias. The vertical force of the fluid consequently moves float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> along guide rod <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, moving float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> closer to second fitting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Once the vertical force of the fluid is equal to that of the gravitational bias of float <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, vertical movement will stabilize. Flow rate readings during this stabilization period can be made according to flow indicia <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Needed adjustments to fluid flow rates can be made based on the obtained flow readings. </paragraph>
