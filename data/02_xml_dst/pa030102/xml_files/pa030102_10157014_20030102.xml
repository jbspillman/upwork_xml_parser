<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to optical recording media recordable on land and groove tracks, and more particularly, to an optical recording medium having an improved structure to compensate for defects of conventional land/groove optical recording media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> DVD-RAM optical recording media use a land/groove recording method by which user data is written both on land and groove tracks. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a part of a conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> capable of performing the above operation. DVD-RAM optical recording media, which are a type of the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, are manufactured to have grooves of &lgr;/6 in depth to minimize cross talk between adjacent tracks. Here, &lgr; denotes the wavelength of an optical source that is used to record and/or reproduce DVD-RAM optical recording media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a track pitch about twice as long as the pitch of groove-only optical recording media that record user data only on grooves. Here, the track pitch denotes the distance between groove tracks G&prime;. Therefore, &plusmn;1<highlight><superscript>st</superscript></highlight>-order diffracted light beams, from light projected onto the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and diffracted by the land/groove structure, enter the inner side of the exit pupil of an objective lens, as compared to groove-only optical recording media. Accordingly, it is well known that the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can obtain a push-pull signal of sufficient magnitude. That is, the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can obtain a tracking error signal of sufficient magnitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, during manufacturing of the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a wobble signal is molded into the groove tracks G&prime; and/or the land tracks L&prime; using changes in the amplitude direction. The wobble signal is used to control the rotating speed of the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to obtain synchronization information of the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, user data is recorded both on the land tracks L&prime; and on the groove tracks G&prime;. The frequency-modulated or phase-modulated wobble is simply formed into both sidewalls of each of the groove tracks G&prime;. Thus, it is impossible to record address information to recognize physical locations on the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to record address information, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such as a DVD-RAM has rugged pre-pits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed on its header area using a complementary allocated pit address (CAPA) method. A track pitch is less than the size of a light spot. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the CAPA method forms pre-pits in the header area on the border of adjacent tracks at intervals of two tracks in order to minimize the influence upon the pre-pits of adjacent tracks. Here, a wobble signal and an address signal can be obtained from a push-pull signal, which is obtained by performing a differential operation on detected signals. The detected signals are obtained by dividing the light beams reflected/diffracted by the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into two parts in the radial direction of the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and by detecting electrical signals from the two reflected/diffracted light beam parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, as described above with respect to the DVD-RAM optical recording medium as an example, the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generally has the pre-pits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed in the header area to record address information. Therefore, the recording density is reduced by the pre-pit area formed to record the address information. In addition, the grooves and the pre-pits are mixed up on the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the light amount from the light beams reflected by the optical recording medium varies depending on the positions on the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> irradiated by the light beam. Thus, it is impossible to achieve multi-layered recording. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention can record user data on groove tracks G and land tracks L. A first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on both sidewalls of a corresponding groove track G to be close to the groove track G. A second wobble <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed close to a corresponding land track L on both sidewalls of the land track L. A middle portion M is also formed at a predetermined position on the sidewall between adjacent pairs of the land and groove tracks L and G so that the region where the first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed is distinguished from the region where the second wobble <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, the first and second wobbles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> embed a wobble signal which carries the address information. The address information recorded on the first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is detected during scanning of the groove tracks G. The address information recorded on the second wobble <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is detected during scanning of the land tracks L. The detection of the address information recorded on the first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is independent of the detection of the address information recorded on the second wobble <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>C, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a structure in which the independent first and second wobbles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed on the sidewall between adjacent land and groove tracks L and G in the depth direction of a groove. The address information of the groove track G is added to a wobble signal of the first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and recorded on the first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The address information of the land track L is added to a wobble signal of the second wobble <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> independent of the wobble signal of the first wobble <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is recorded on the second wobble <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thus, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention having this structure can minimize its non-recordable area and increase its recordable area as compared to the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which records address information in pre-pits formed in the header area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The recording of address information on the first and second wobbles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is achieved by techniques used in the technical field of the present invention. According to embodiments of the invention, the recording techniques include phase modulation, frequency modulation, and/or amplitude modulation. For example, as shown in the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> records the wobble signal is bi-phase modulated with respect to each of the land tracks L and the groove tracks G. Specifically, a bi-phase shift keying (BPSK) wobble signal is used to record the address information on the first and second wobbles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the invention, in the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the groove track G is formed at a distance of &lgr;/6 apart from the land track L so as to minimize the cross talk occurring between adjacent tracks G and L. However, it is understood that the distance can be altered as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention has such a structure as to have the advantages of the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and those of a conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention has a track pitch (tp) approximately twice the size of the track pitch of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thus, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> obtains a push-pull signal of sufficient magnitude (i.e., a tracking error signal) similar to the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, a track pitch of the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (i.e., tp&equals;0.64 &mgr;m) is twice the size of a track pitch of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (i.e., tp&equals;0.32 &mgr;m). The track pitch of the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is roughly the same as a track pitch of the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e., tp&equals;0.64 &mgr;m). It is understood that, in practice, the track pitch of the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is slightly less than double the track pitch of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</cross-reference> show the baseball patterns of light beams reflected/diffracted by the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, wherein the light beams are observed through the exit pupil of an objective lens (not shown). As described above, since the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a longer track pitch than the track pitch of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, more of the &plusmn;1st-order light beams reflected/diffracted by the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> enter the exit pupil of an objective lens than the case of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, &plusmn;1st-order light beams reflected/diffracted by the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> overlap at the center of the exit pupil of the objective lens. On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, &plusmn;1st-order light beams reflected/diffracted by the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> do not overlap. When the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a track pitch with the same length as the track pitch of the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applied to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, we can see from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> that &plusmn;1st-order light beams reflected/diffracted by the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> overlap at the center of the exit pupil of an objective lens, similar to the overlap found in the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, the &plusmn;1st-order light beams appear at the periphery of the exit pupil due to the existence of the middle portion M, which is similar to the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C are graphs showing a push-pull signal for the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the reflection/diffraction properties as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</cross-reference>, respectively. The inventor of the present invention confirmed that, when the peak-to-peak signal size of a push-pull signal for the land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set to be 100%, the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> obtains a push-pull signal of about 25% and the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention obtains a push-pull signal of about 110%. Thus, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention acquires a tracking signal of sufficient magnitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Table 2 shows the data-to-data jitter representing the influence of cross talk between adjacent tracks upon the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to track pitches, based on the conditions of Table 1. As presented in Table 2, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention has a data-to-data jitter value about 1-2% less than that of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The track pitch in Table 2 denotes the distance between mark rows. That is, in Table 2, the track pitch of the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> denotes the distance between groove tracks, and the track pitch of the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> denotes the distance between a groove track G and a land track L. As shown in Table 2, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is less affected by cross talk. Hence, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an advantage in increasing the linear density in the track direction by a reduction of the track pitch and/or in guaranteeing a system margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As described above, similar to the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is less affected by cross talk from adjacent tracks. Therefore, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> obtains a push-pull signal of sufficient magnitude. In addition, similar to the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> records address information in wobbles. Thus, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> minimizes the non-recordable area so to acquire a larger recordable area than the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is known to present a disadvantage when compared to the conventional groove-only optical recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the cross writing between adjacent tracks, such as cross erasing. Appropriate selection of the structure and material of a recording film of an optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can reduce the cross writing, but also decreases the recording speed. According to the technical field of the present invention, if the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured to reduce cross writing, the recording speed decreases, and, if it is manufactured to increase the recording speed, it has a disadvantage in cross writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> However, compared to the conventional land/groove optical recording medium <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, since the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention has a middle portion M, it is expected that the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> limits the cross writing property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An optical recording medium according to the present invention as described above includes a first wobble formed close to a groove track along both sidewalls of the groove track and a second wobble formed close to a land track along both sidewalls of the land track. Thus, the optical recording medium can record wobble signals carrying address information in the first and second wobbles. Accordingly, the optical recording medium according to the present invention can significantly decrease the non-recordable area compared to conventional land/groove optical recording media, resulting in a great improvement in recording density. Also, the optical recording medium according to the present invention adds address information to a wobble signal and records the wobble signal carrying the address information, so that it can remarkably reduce the pre-pits formed in the header area compared to conventional land/groove optical recording media. Thus, the optical recording medium according to the present invention presents the advantage of a multi-layer recording when compared to conventional land/groove optical recording media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Although a few preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
