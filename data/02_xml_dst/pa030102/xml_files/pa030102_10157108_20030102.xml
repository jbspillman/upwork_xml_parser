Thus, recreational activities able to release pressure are desperately sought after by work-laden people. However, domestic or overseas traveling and vacationing cost money, therefore are not affordable for all working people and students; in addition, it takes time to do domestic or overseas traveling and vacationing, for at least one or two days are necessary, some trips even take weeks to complete. As a result, for most work-laden people with limited resources of time and money, having barbecue is undoubtedly the best choice for them to relax and recuperate out of the constant pressure, since it costs much less in terms of time and money, and suitable for participation by the whole family members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As to the different design of grills provided in the market, the earliest type of the grill is of a fixated grill, with the grill body and supporting frame formed integrally. Such a grill causes inconvenience for the user by its cumbersome volume. Later on, such kind of fixated grill is improved by a grill assembly, which includes detachable grill body and the supporting frame jointed by screws, and can be detached after use, thus improving the drawback of the foregoing fixated grill that causes inconvenience for the user by its cumbersome volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, mainly includes a grill body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a supporting frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; the supporting frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises frame supports <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, supporting rods <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and connecting rods <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, and screws <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are used to joint such three components, and then the grill body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the supporting frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus completes the assembly of the grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, because of the complicated structure of the grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a volume of complicated instruction manual must be enclosed with the grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, the user, after purchasing such a grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, must read the instruction manual carefully and complete the assembly step by step, a means of assembly that not only causes difficulty, but is also time-consuming, for user must spend great deal of time in both reading the manual and assembling the grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, for those consumers who are not familiar with such technique, the grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to cause difficulty and inconvenience, and even prevents the user from successfully completing the assembly process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the assembly grill <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the prior art though is designed to improve upon the drawback of the conventional grill&apos;s cumbersome volume that causes difficulty and inconvenience for the user to carry or store, it also causes problems out of complicated assembly process due to too many screw parts and thus time-consuming.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, which show respectively the structural perspective view of the folded and stretched foldable supporting frame of the present invention, the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mainly includes supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a horizontally installed frame, and the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are independent plain-surface frames installed at the two sides of the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> respectively, with pivots <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> connecting the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thus the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be moved by using pivots <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> as pivots, to be folded inward (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) or to be stretched outward (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Please continue referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. In the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, under folding condition, are folded inward to right and left respectively and superposed on top of the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thus forming a minimum-height structure that, formed by superposing rods, occupies limited space. When using, the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be stretched by rotating and stretching counter-clockwise the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the left with pivot <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> as pivot, and rotating and stretching clockwise to the right the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the right with pivot <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> as pivot. At this time, with the lower ends of the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaching the ground through rotation, the structure for common supporting frames is thus formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. After using, the supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be disassembled through reversing the aforementioned procedures, thus achieving the purpose of folding the supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. The pivots <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, used to pivotally joint the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively, are L-shaped pivots oppositely facing each other on the left and on the right. The L-shaped pivots <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> both comprise a pair of chip-shaped units symmetrical to each other, which are jointed by the aligning portions <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and such aligning portions are also used as the stopping devices against the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when stretching. The right end of the pivot <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is fixatedly jointed to the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be fitted between the two chip-shaped units of the pivot <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, with a pivot bolt <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> to pierce through and align. The rear side of the present invention is a mirror symmetry structure of the front side, therefore it is no need to be described here. The supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with a pair of pivots <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> opposite to each other on the front and rear side as pivot, is to be folded by being rotated clockwise (as shown by the arrow of solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). While stretching, the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be stretched by being rotated counterclockwise (as shown by the arrow of dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), and after being stretched, the lower ends of the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reach the ground and thus form the supporting legs; in addition, the aligning portion <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is to work as the stopping and aligning mechanism of the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so as to prevent the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from overstretching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the pivot <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and the supporting <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the pivot <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> are facing one another correspondingly; the left end of the pivot <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is fixated to the connecting rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be fitted between the two chip-shaped units of the pivot <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, with the pivot bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to pierce through and align. Therefore, when folding, the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be rotated counterclockwise (as shown by the arrow of solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) with the pivot bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> as pivot; when stretching, the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be rotated clockwise (as shown by the arrow of dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), and the lower ends of the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thus reach the ground and form the supporting legs. In addition, the aligning portion <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is to work as the stopping and aligning mechanism of the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so as to prevent the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from overstretching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The length of the pivot <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is longer than that of the pivot <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and the position of the pivot <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the corresponding pivot <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, thus when the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are to be folded inward, the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be on top of the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is further installed with a strengthening device to strengthen the structure of the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention, thus the degree of resistance to force by the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be increased. The strengthening device can be installed between the two supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for supporting the supporting frame structure when the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are fully stretched outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the perspective view of the second embodiment of the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention. This embodiment of the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> utilizes the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as a strengthening device; the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is integrally formed frame, with the stopping portions <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> installed at the lower part of the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thus when the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fully stretched, the user can place the left end of the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on top of the crossbar <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the supporting rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with the stopping portion <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> propping against the crossbar <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>; at this time, the user can further utilizes the crossbar <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as a fulcrum to lower the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the protruding portion of the lower end of the stopping portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is to come into contact with the crossbar <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and then the user presses the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as to make the stopping portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> smoothly slide down and prop against the supporting rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the stopping portion <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are respectively propped against the crossbars <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, thus forming the strengthening structure for the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This embodiment of the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> employs the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to hold the fully stretched supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to prevent the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from folding inward and collapsing, thus forming the aligning device; also with the strengthening frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the degree of resistance to force by the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the perspective view of the third embodiment of the foldable supporting frame of the present invention. The present invention can further joint with a grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>; on top of the supporting rods <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> fixating bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are installed, which are of a rod-like structure, each with one end fixated to the supporting rods, and the other end forming a free end. At the lower part of the grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, jointing portions <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, which are narrow reversed-V-shape grooves on top of which arc-shaped structures are formed, are installed in accordance with the positions of the fixating bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the fixating bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the foldable supporting frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are to enter into the narrow reversed-V-shape grooves of the grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> until the fixating bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reach the bottom of the narrow reversed-V-shape grooves of the grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and fall into the arc-shaped portions. Thus the four corners of the grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be fixated and supported by four sets of fixating bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Please continue referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The jointing portions <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of the grill body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are furthered installed with locking chips <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, which are L-shaped chip structures, on the top end of each a pivoting portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> is installed to joint with the jointing portion <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of the grill body. A pushing/holding chip <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is installed at the lower end of each locking chip <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, and on the corresponding side of each pushing/holding chip <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> an arc-shaped opening is formed.
