<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to plasma processing and more particularly to a system including a gas injection component for improved plasma processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typically, during materials processing, plasma is employed to facilitate the addition and removal of material films when fabricating composite material structures. For example, in semiconductor processing, a (dry) plasma etch process is utilized to remove or etch material along fine lines or within vias or contacts patterned on a silicon substrate. The plasma etch process generally involves positioning a semiconductor substrate with an overlying patterned, protective layer (for example, a photoresist layer) into a processing chamber. Once the substrate is positioned within the chamber, an ionizable, dissociative gas mixture is introduced within the chamber at a pre-specified flow rate, while a vacuum pump is throttled to achieve an ambient process pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a plasma is formed when a fraction of the gas species present are ionized by electrons heated via the transfer of radio frequency (RF) power either inductively or capacitively, or microwave power using, for example, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). Moreover, the heated electrons serve to dissociate some species of the ambient gas species and create reactant specie(s) suitable for the exposed surface etch chemistry. Once the plasma is formed, any exposed surfaces of the substrate are etched by the plasma. The process is adjusted to achieve optimal conditions, including an appropriate concentration of desirable reactant and ion populations to etch various features (e.g., trenches, vias, contacts, etc.) in the exposed regions of the substrate. Such substrate materials where etching is required include silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), poly-silicon and silicon nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As the feature size shrinks and the number and complexity of the etch process steps used during integrated circuit (IC) fabrication escalate, the ability to control the transport of reactive materials to and effluent etch products from etch features becomes more stringent. The ability to control such processes must insure achievement of the proper chemical balance necessary to attain high etch rates with good material selectivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The etch rate in most dry etch applications (for example, oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) etch applications) includes a physical component and a chemical component. The plasma chemistry should create a population of positively charged (for example, relatively heavy, singly charged argon ions) utilized as the physical component and a population of chemical radicals (such as atomic fluorine F, and CF, CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, CF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or more generally CF<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>species in a fluorocarbon plasma) utilized for the chemical component. Moreover, the chemical reactants (CF<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>) act as reactants in the surface etch chemistry and the (heavy) positively charged ions (Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) provide energy to catalyze the surface reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As feature sizes progressively shrink, they do so at a rate greater than the shrinking oxide and other film thicknesses. Therefore, the etch feature aspect ratio (depth-to-width) is greatly increased with shrinking sizes, for example on the order 10:1. As the aspect ratio increases, the directionality of chemical reactant and ion transport local to the etch features becomes increasingly important in order to preserve the anisotropy of the etch feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The transport of electrically charged species such as ions can be affected by an electric force and, therefore, it is conventional in the industry to provide a substrate holder or chuck with an RF bias to attract and accelerate ions to the substrate surface through the plasma sheath such that they arrive moving in a direction substantially normal to the substrate surface. However, the transport of neutral, chemically reactive species is not amenable to the application of an electric force to assert their directionality at the substrate surface. In order to affect the same, gas species are injected under high pressure to preserve their directionality upon expanding into the low-pressure environment and the ambient pressure is sufficiently reduced to further maintain a narrow angular distribution of the velocity field near the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to affect changes in the transport of neutral species local to the substrate surface and, thus, affect the etch rate of high aspect ratio features, the gas injection total pressure can be increased. One way to increase the gas injection total pressure is to increase the mass flow rate of process gas into the process chamber. However, in order to achieve the same process pressure, the pumping speed to the processing region must be proportionately increased. For example, when utilizing a shower-head gas injection system including approximately three-hundred-and-sixty 0.5 mm diameter orifices of 1 cm in length with a typical process gas flow rate, for example, of 400 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) argon, the gas injection total pressure can be approximately 6 Torr. In order to increase the gas injection total pressure by a factor of ten (e.g., from 6 to 60 Torr), the mass flow rate must be increased by a factor of ten (e.g., from 400 to 4000 sccm argon) and, therefore to achieve the same process pressure of, for example, 20 mTorr, the pumping speed at the processing region must also be increased by a factor of ten (e.g., from 250 to 2500 liters per second). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A turbo-molecular pump (TMP) with a minimum inlet pumping speed of 5000 liters per second is employed to achieve this demand for pumping speed. The TMP includes a vacuum chamber configured to have at least a flow conductance equivalent to that of the inlet pumping speed to the TMP. However, these high-speed pumps are cumbersome, and extremely expensive (e.g., currently such pumps cost approximately $100,000 per pump with an additional $50,000 for an appropriately sized gate valve). Moreover, to accommodate their size and enable the aforesaid flow conductance, the process chamber footprint must be increased. Consequently, they are not an economically viable solution. Therefore, what is needed is a way to substantially increase the gas injection total pressure while satisfying an upper limit to the process gas flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another technique is to pulse the gas in short bursts as it enters the process chamber. However, this technique results in transient pressure waves due to the large volume of gas introduced to the chamber with each pulse. In particular, there is an abrupt increase in chamber pressure followed by a slow decay as the vacuum pump struggles to bring the pressure back to specification. What is needed is a way to increase the gas injection total pressure without creating a substantially non-stationary process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A further method of increasing the gas injection total pressure, while not affecting the mass flow rate or process chamber pressure, involves reducing the number and/or size of the gas injection orifices (i.e. reducing the total injection flow-through area). However, this reduction can seriously jeopardize process uniformity over large substrates, for example, 200 to 300 mm and greater. Conventional systems achieve uniform etching of substrates by maintaining a uniform gas flow over the substrate surface (in addition to other requirements). In order to achieve a uniform introduction of the process gas to the process environment, materials processing devices utilize a showerhead gas distribution system comprising a plurality of gas orifices, for example, on the order 100 to 1000 gas injection orifices of 0.5 mm in diameter. However, to maintain conventional process recipes (i.e. chamber pressure and gas flow rate) optimal for etch applications such as oxide etch applications, the injection pressure is limited and neutral flow directionality suitable for high aspect ratio feature etch is sacrificed. What is needed is a way to increase the gas injection total pressure while achieving specifications for process uniformity and employing practical gas injection orifice geometry. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A plasma processing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> including chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, gas injection system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, substrate holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> upon which a substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to be processed is affixed, pumping duct <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and vacuum pumping system <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to facilitate the generation of plasma <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> adjacent a surface of substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, wherein plasma <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed via collisions between heated electrons and an ionizable gas. An ionizable gas or mixture of gases is introduced via gas injection system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the process pressure is adjusted using a gate valve (not shown) to throttle the vacuum pumping system <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. For example, plasma <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is utilized to create materials specific to a pre-determined materials process, and to aid either the deposition of material to a substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> or the removal of material from the exposed surfaces of substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is transferred into and out of chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a slot valve (not shown) and chamber feed-through (not shown) via robotic substrate transfer system where it is received by substrate lift pins (not shown) housed within chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and mechanically translated by devices housed therein. Once substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is received from substrate transfer system, it is lowered to an upper surface of chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and affixed to chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via an electrostatic clamp (not shown). Moreover, gas may be delivered to the back-side of the substrate to improve the gas-gap thermal conductance between the substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can further include a cooling system including a re-circulating coolant flow that receives heat from chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and transfers heat to a heat exchanger system (not shown), or when heating, transfers heat from the heat exchanger system. Such a system can be utilized when temperature control of the substrate is required at elevated or reduced temperatures. For example, temperature control of the substrate may be useful at temperatures in excess of the steady-state temperature achieved due to a balance of the heat flux delivered to the substrate from the plasma and the heat flux removed from substrate by conduction to the chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, heating elements, such as resistive heating elements, can be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, plasma <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is utilized to process substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. For example, chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is electrically biased at a RF voltage via the transmission of RF power from RF generator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through impedance match network <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to chuck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The RF bias can serve to heat electrons and, thereby, capacitively couple power to plasma <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, it can operate as a reactive ion etch (RIE) reactor, wherein the chamber and upper gas injection electrode serve as ground surfaces. A typical frequency for the RF bias is 13.56 MHz. In another example, chuck electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can serve to bias the substrate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to control the ion energy during processing steps, wherein an additional electrode (e.g., inductive coil or electrode opposite the substrate) serves to generate a high density plasma (HDP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The process gas is introduced to the plasma reactor via gas injection system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> including gas injection electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, gas valve manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, mass flow controller manifold <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Process gas originates from the gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a cabinet that houses a plurality of compressed gas cylinders, each of which stores a gas. The gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably further includes pressure regulators for safe gas handling practices known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is also coupled to a controller <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The mass flow controller manifold <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is coupled to the gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The mass flow controller manifold <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of mass flow controllers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>D. In a preferred embodiment, each mass flow controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>D monitors and controls the mass flow rate of a single processing gas being supplied by gas supply <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. For example, four processing gases can be used. In an oxide etch process (e.g., a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>etch process), processing gases include Ar, C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, wherein a fourth gas nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is available for chamber purging. An exemplary process recipe is a gas composition with flow rates Ar/C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>/O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;400/7/12 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute). Although provisions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are made for four gases, either more than four gases or less than four gases can be used in alternate embodiments. Other gases can include C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, HF, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, HBr, CO, etc. The gate valve located adjacent vacuum pump <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in pumping duct <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be partially open in order to adjust the chamber process pressure to approximately 20 mTorr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The mass flow controller manifold <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is coupled to the controller <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, each mass flow controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>D is coupled to the controller <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The mass flow controllers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>D are preferably commercially available mass flow controllers capable of regulating the flow rate of gas ranging from 1 sccm to 2000 sccm (the mass flow controller is calibrated per the process specifications as discussed above). For example, 500 sccm, 40 sccm and 20 sccm mass flow controllers would be suitable for the above gas composition and flow rates, respectively. </paragraph>

This geometry is referred to as a &ldquo;minimum-length&rdquo; nozzle; a simplified version of a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; nozzle. Minimum-length and perfect nozzles are well known to those skilled in the art.

The Method of Characteristics is a well-known method used to design a divergent nozzle and, more specifically, it is used to tailor the divergent nozzle shape (particularly those divergent nozzles with a non-zero second derivative of the wall coordinate) to avoid nozzle shock losses. The use of the Method of Characteristics can lead to what are known as &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum-length&rdquo; nozzles. This method and such nozzles are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
