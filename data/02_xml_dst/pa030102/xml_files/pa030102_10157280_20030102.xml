<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a system for displaying health monitoring information for a complex plant in an organized easily understand manner, including a single enterprise level health condition display supplemented with multiple tiers of detail information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many industries, such as the power generation industry, are utilizing health-monitoring technology to improve the long term availability and reliability of plant components. With this technology it is possible to obtain relatively reliable predictions of subsequent equipment and system failures. This allows corrective or compensating actions to be implemented prior to the actual failure of equipment or systems, thus minimizing the operability and economic consequences of such failures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A key to effective utilization of the predictive failure information as determined by a health monitoring system is to adequately present such information to the operations staff in a convenient and readily understandable manner. This is especially critical at the enterprise level in which the sum total of plant-wide health information must be logically presented to the operations staff for evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Currently, health monitoring information is presented in a fragmented manner. There is a need to better organize and present the health monitoring results on a global level, and to simplify the interpretation of such information so the user is presented with concise information on the potential of future system and component failures, in a manner that supports his operational tasks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This need and others are satisfied by the invention which is directed to a health monitoring display system for a complex plant that includes sensors generating sensed values of specified parameters in the complex plant, a health monitoring system that determines from the sensed value a health condition for a plurality of portions of the complex plant, and a human machine interface incorporating a display device presenting in a single enterprise level display page the health condition of each of selected of the portions of the complex plant chosen to provide an indication of enterprise-wide health of the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The display device includes means for displaying multiple tiers of information relevant to the health of a selected portion of the complex plant selected through the operator input device. The multiple tiers of displays are selected starting with the single enterprise level or apex display. The display device includes means for displaying information on the possible failure of sub-components of the selected portion of the complex plant in a first tier display. These pages of the first tier display include a predicted time to failure for each of the sub-components and may be sequentially arranged according to such predicted time to failure. In the exemplary system an expected time to failure, an upper bound of the predicted time to failure and a lower bound of the predicted time to failure are presented for each sub-component. The display page can also include the expected down time for each sub-component and may include the time to scheduled outage for comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The second tier presents pages each displaying the faults for a failure mode selected from the first tier display. The faults are displayed in a hierarchy and can include a failure state probability for each fault. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A third tier includes multiple display pages each with different details on the selected failure mode. The details presented in these pages can include a state probability of the selected failure mode, a mimic display, historical data, a maintenance log, cost functions, and feature/sensor data. The state probability can be presented as a probability of a normal state, an intermediate state, and a severe state. The historical data can be represented graphically, for instance, sensor values recorded over a period of time can be displayed. Cost functions displayed can include a representation of the cost of the failure to be expected from the selected failure mode. For instance, a graphical representation of the cost to be expected as a function of the time that the repair is made can be presented. Also, the cost of operating the complex plant as a function of time over an extended period can also be presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A common hierarchy of failure domains, such as an imminent probability of failure, a low probability of failure and an intermediate probability of failure are used throughout to promote rapid intuitive recognition of impaired health.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> To perform its incipient failure detection function, the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> periodically and/or continuously (as appropriate) performs the necessary algorithmic processing on the requisite component and/or process measurements obtained from the Data Acquisition System <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Due to the wide variety of equipment and plant processes that exist within a plant, a variety of techniques are necessarily utilized to ascertain the potential of incipient equipment failures and to predict the equipment remaining life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The following are typical of the methodologies that are utilized by the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to ascertain the potential of incipient equipment failures and to predict the equipment remaining life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Trend Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Trend analysis is used to assess equipment health and degradation by monitoring for changes in selected measurement parameters over time. The trended information may be in either the time domain (such as absolute vibration level tracked against time) or in the frequency domain (such as vibration amplitude over a frequency spectrum which is monitored&mdash;in this case significant increases/changes in amplitude at various frequencies are tracked in time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> To perform trend analysis, parameters to be trended are first identified, and trend periodicity to be utilized is then defined, and alert/warning criteria for early identification of impending problems are finally developed. Typically, the equipment manufacturers&apos; recommendations and industry experience are used to develop alert/alarm criteria. Statistical methods are utilized to enhance the trend accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Pattern Recognition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Pattern Recognition techniques are utilized to assess equipment health and degradation by analyzing the selected measurement parameters relative to state or status patterns. Statistical methods are used to improve pattern recognition accuracy. Techniques such as Time Source Analysis and Fast Fourier Transform are typically used to process the data in conjunction with pattern recognition algorithms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Correlation Techniques </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Related sets of data may be correlated to assist in performing predictive analysis. Correlation coefficients are developed to aid in the recognition of patterns or the recognition of sequences of events that are related. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Limits and Ranges </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Component monitoring may be utilized using alarm/alert limits using thresholds, bands and frequency filters. This approach allows subsequently gathered information to be compared to expected regions of operation for the monitored components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Data Comparison </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Several comparative methods may be utilized for preventative maintenance data analyses. Data for a particular system or component can be compared to standard values, manufacturers&apos; recommendations, technical specifications, code limits, or normal baseline data or ranges. Data may be compared on an absolute basis or a relative basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As an example, data from a specific component may be analyzed to identify discontinuities (breaks) in a performance curve, or data trends, or data offsets. In addition, data on similar components can be compared to develop comparison data relative to similar components. This comparison of data is used to evaluate equipment or system health and aging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Statistical Process Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Statistical methods are used extensively in the analysis of plant data for predicting component health. Techniques, such as curve fitting, data smoothing, predictive techniques and probabilistic inference techniques (such as Bayesian Belief Networks&mdash;BBN&apos;s), and mean standard deviation are extensively being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The predictive maintenance algorithms utilized by the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will employ a variety of the aforementioned techniques, depending on the equipment or system that is being analyzed. The following describes a number of the predictive analysis applications that are employed by the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to predict remaining equipment life. The exemplary complex plant to which the Health Monitoring Display System is applied is a nuclear power plant. However, it will be apparent that the invention has application to other types of complex plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Vibration Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Vibration analysis is utilized to determine the health and useful remaining service life of critical equipment and components in the Nuclear Island (NI) as well as for suitable Balance-of Plant (BOP) components. Vibration detectors transmit vibration information associated with steady state operation and other operating regimes, such as equipment start-up, coast-down and breakaway analyses can be used to enhance the capabilities of the predictive program to detect incipient failures. The remaining equipment life is inferred from vibration frequency analysis by trending amplitude changes in the spectrum over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Equipment transient analysis techniques (for start-up, coast-down and breakaway conditions) include vibration spectral data as a function of machine speed. These analyses are utilized to determine the presence of equipment structural response frequencies as they are excited during the equipment transients (such as start-up and coast-down). Trending, comparative analysis and signature frequency analysis techniques are utilized to detect indications of component degradation and to predict remaining component useful life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Temperature Measurement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Indications of incipient mechanical and electrical problems can often be determined by the presence of excessive heat generation or by the absence of suitable heat output. Temperature measurement technologies, such as contact pyrometry and thermography, are used to by Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to support predictive maintenance applications. Measurements obtained via infrared thermography and contact pyrometry are used to determine the remaining life of electrical switch gear, motor control centers, and transformer. The remaining life of electrical connections, insulation, and of equipment that is experiencing friction induced heating is also inferred by monitoring heat generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Flow Measurement of Liquids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For certain equipment and systems, flow changes are an indicator of impending component failure and of remaining equipment life.

</table-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The use of failure domains allows rapid and intuitive recognition of the failure status by the user. For instance, in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, Charging Pump 1A is indicated as being in the severe domain, Reactor Coolant Pump 1A is in the intermediate domain and the remainder of the components and systems are in the normal domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The display is based on a &ldquo;Green Board&rdquo; concept, such that when all component boxes are displayed in green there is no equipment that has a significant probability of failure. Any equipment that is displayed with other than a green color has a significant probability of a failure occurring. The failure could be imminent (red color, and numerical indicator&equals;1) or expected at some intermediate time interval (yellow color, and numerical indicator&equals;2). Thus, the overall health status of plant equipment is readily ascertained from just visual inspection of the Apex display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The display is interactive in that any of the component boxes may be selected and interrogated to determine what are the prevailing failure modes. This is accomplished by simply designating the component (box) of interest by selecting it via the Operator Input Device (OID) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and activating the selection. For example, using a mouse as the OID <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the user would first maneuver the mouse to place the cursor on the desired component (box) and would activate the selection using a &ldquo;mouse click&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a typical interactive display for the Tier-1 sub-component health page <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This display indicates the health status of all the sub-components <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, that comprise a single plant component, plant system, or a specific piece of plant equipment <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. If the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> detects multiple sub-components <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that are predicted to cause subsequent failures, then each of these sub-components is depicted and displayed. The sub-components are arranged on the display page in the expected time sequence order that they are predicted to fail (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The Tier 1 display <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> utilizes the same color coding as the Apex (plant-wide) health status page <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for consistency and to provide additional visual clueing to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The display indicates the expected time to failure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for each sub-component including the lower <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and upper <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> time bounds (as determined by the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), the expected &ldquo;down time&rdquo; <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for each indicated sub-component, and an indication <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the time remaining until the next scheduled outage. This provides the user with information that supports planning of strategies on how to cope with impending failures and how to prioritize repair work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The display is interactive in that any of the sub-components <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be selected to access lower-tier supporting information pages. This is accomplished by simply designating the sub-component of interest by selecting it via the Operator Input Device (OID) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and activating the selection. For example, using a mouse as the OID <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the user would first maneuver the mouse to place the cursor on the desired sub-component and would activate the selection using a &ldquo;mouse click&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> For each sub-component, there are multiple ways in which the sub-component could fail. Each of these failures is designated as a &ldquo;fault&rdquo; <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The Tier-2 display page <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> depicts the fault status for each of the sub-components <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that are associated with a plant system, plant component, or specific piece of plant equipment <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a typical Tier-2 Fault Display page <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The display indicates the probability of failure for each of the faults as determined by the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by presenting a normal state probability <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an intermediate state probability <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a severe state probability <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The faults are presented in a hierarchy <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A number of Tier-3 display pages <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>(Drill Down Displays) provide supporting information to the user. Each page supplies detailed low-level data which is used for analysis, diagnostics and repair planning purposes. Each display on Tier three can be rapidly accessed via use of the Tab Index which is located on the top of each Tier-three page as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> where the &ldquo;state probability&rdquo; has been selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Maneuvering through Tier-three pages is achieved via the &ldquo;Tab Index&rdquo; access mechanism. This allows all of the lower level displays to be quickly accessed via &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; maneuvering, in an intuitive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> There are six typical types of Tier-three display pages as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 1. Health Monitoring Status Details Page <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&mdash;This page displays specific details relative to the Health Monitoring Status Module algorithmic outputs to support analysis of the failure prediction logic. An example of this type of page is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for the case in which Bayesian Belief Networks are the basis of the failure prediction logic within the Health Monitoring Status Module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Other failure prediction methodologies would result in outputs unique to those methodologies. The example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the normal <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, intermediate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and severe <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> state probabilities for the bearings sub-component. </paragraph>

Cost Function Display Pages <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>(<highlight><subscript>1,2</subscript></highlight>)&mdash;These pages display the outputs from the cost function calculator (contained within the Maintenance Log and Scheduler Module <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) that computes dollar costs associated with a repair. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a typical Tier-3 Cost Function display <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, that plots the cost of electricity as a function of time. This information is useful in scheduling down time for a repair. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates another typical Tier-3 Cost Function display that shows the repair cost as a function of when the repair is scheduled. The traces <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> represent the mean, 95 percentile and 5 percentile costs, respectively. Other cost functions could be presented in addition to or in place of those illustrated in the examples of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Unique features of the Health Monitoring Display system of the invention include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Use of color-coded failure domains allows rapid and intuitive recognition of component failure status by the operator, via visual clueing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Use of alpha-numeric coding for failure domains provides a second independent coding mechanism that supports users who are challenged relative to color discrimination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Implementation of a &ldquo;Green Board&rdquo; concept for the Tier-one display allows the enterprise level (plant-wide) health status to be immediately ascertained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Implementation of sub-component (Tier 1) display pages that depict the sub-components that are associated with each plant component, plant system, or specific piece of plant equipment, in the expected time-sequence order in which they are predicted fail along with the down (repair) time for each sub-component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Implementation of fault (Tier 2) display pages that depict the explicit faults (failure mechanisms) associated with each sub-component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Detailed component health-related data for a component that is predicted to fail is provided by the Tier-3 detailed support page. Each page supplies detailed low-level data that is used for health state analysis, diagnostics and for repair planning purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Maneuvering through Tier-3 detailed health-related pages is achieved via a &ldquo;Tab Index&rdquo; access mechanism. This allows all of the lower level health-related displays to be quickly accessed via &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; maneuvering, in an intuitive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Use of a multi-tier display hierarchy allow the health monitoring information to be integrated and organized in a manner that supports a logical &ldquo;top down&rdquo; information structured from the high-level failure status overview of plant components (Apex), to the sub-component health status (Tier-1), to specific information relative to sub-component faults (Tier-2), to detailed low level data (Tier-3) which is used for health analysis, diagnostics and repair planning purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> A cost function calculator (contained within the Maintenance Log and Scheduler Module <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) computes the dollar cost associated with maintenance repair scheduling. </paragraph>

This approach simplifies subsequent software maintenance since all changes can be made as database revisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Explanation of how the unique features provide advantages over the existing technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The display system presents failure prediction information at the enterprise level, using a single display page, so that the overall plant-wide equipment health status can be readily ascertained without the need to search through multiple display pages to derive overall plant-wide health state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The format and design of the overall health status summary page (Apex display) allows the enterprise level health status to be quickly ascertained, in an unambiguous manner, via use of color-coded &ldquo;failure domains&rdquo;. Current technology is not optimized for displaying overall enterprise-level health status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The overall health status summary page (Apex display) also incorporates a redundant alpha-numeric coding scheme for the failure domains that supports users who are challenged relative to color discrimination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Projections of the failure of sub-components that are associated with each plant component, plant system, or specific piece of plant equipment are presented on the Tier 1 display pages. These pages provide explicit details on the sub-component health state and the projected time to failure. Current technology is fragmented on the identification and display of the sub-component health state and projected time to failure for sub-components. By identifying the projected sub-component failures, the user, is provided with useful information that supports advanced planning of maintenance strategies to cope with the impending failures and for maintenance scheduling purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Individual failure mechanisms (faults) for each sub-component are identified in the Tier 2 displays. This allows a better understanding of the failure process so that corrective actions can be taken to avoid, or minimize, the subsequent reoccurrence of similar failures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> By providing the enterprise level health status information within a single overview page, the operations staff is provided with a global view of the plant-wide health state and is better able to determine what equipment or systems are likely to experience failures within the near future and plan appropriate corrective or compensating actions to be implemented in order to mitigate the consequences of the expected failures. Current technology does not adequately integrate enterprise level health monitoring data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> By providing the enterprise level health status information within a single overview page, the operations staff is better able to plan the execution of future plant evolutions by considering the probability of failure of critical or required equipment or systems occurring during the planned evolution period. Current technology does not adequately integrate enterprise level health monitoring data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The multi tier display hierarchy organizes the information in a manner that supports a logical &ldquo;top down&rdquo; information structure from the high-level failure status overview of plant components (Apex), to the sub-component health status (Tier 1), to specific information relative to sub-component faults (Tier 2), to detailed low-level data (Tier-3) which is used for health analysis, diagnostics and repair planning purposes. Current technology does not provide an integrated hierarchical structure with rapid access to various levels of health related information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A cost function calculator (contained within the Maintenance Log and Scheduler Module <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) computes the dollar cost associated with various maintenance repair scheduling. This information provided by this calculator is used to provide supporting information to assist the operations staff in planning repair or replacement strategies for a component that is predicted to fail by indicating the financial cost associated with maintenance strategy and maintenance scheduling. Current technology does not integrate cost functions within the health monitoring application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure.
