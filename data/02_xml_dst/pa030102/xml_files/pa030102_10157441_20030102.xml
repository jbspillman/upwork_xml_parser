<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to methods and apparatuses for chilling beverages, and more specifically to methods and apparatuses for making an individual disposable package for freezable substances that is contained within a container, wherein the freezable substances, once frozen, have an elongated, narrow form such that they can be removed from the disposable package and inserted into a beverage container, beverage can, juice can, water bottle, sports bottle or the like and can more effectively cool the entire depth of the beverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Basic &ldquo;cube-shaped&rdquo; ice &ldquo;cubes&rdquo; and ice cube trays are known in the prior art. Typically, ice cube trays are designed to produce ice cubes having a cubic or rectangular form. The prior art also teaches ice cube trays which produce ice cubes having a variety of forms. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,417,716 an ice tray is disclosed which forms completely enclosed chambers of different shaped ice. Further, in Des. 287,856 another shaped ice cube tray is disclosed. Other designs are disclosed in U.S. Des. Pat. Nos. D244,275; D292,802; and D318,281. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, the manufacture and sale of pre-packaged containers of ice to consumers is also well known in the art. Bags of pre-packaged ice can be purchased at almost any gas station, convenience store or grocery store in the country. Similarly, most stores also sell pre-packaged containers of reusable &ldquo;ice-cubes&rdquo;. These reusable &ldquo;ice cubes&rdquo; consist of a plastic mold filled with a freezable substance (usually water). The plastic mold including the freezable substance is frozen and the mold is placed in a beverage container to cool the beverage. Once the freezable substance melts, the mold can be refrozen and reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Notwithstanding the fact that the prior art teaches both ice cubes having a variety of forms and the pre-packaging of ice cubes, the prior art does not teach individual disposable packages for frozen substances, containers for these disposable packages, or a method of freezing a substance such that the freezable substance, once frozen, has an elongated form such that the frozen substance is insertable into a beverage container, beverage can, juice can, water bottle, sports bottle or the like and resultingly more effectively cools the entire depth of the beverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For example, a conventional beverage can has a depth of about 5.0 inches (127 mm) and has an opening with a width of about 0.75 inches (19.05 mm). Beverage containers such as water, soda or beverage bottles have various depths ranging from about 11.0 inches (279.4 mm) for a typical polyester two liter bottle to about 6.0 inches (152.4 mm) for a typical bottled water bottle. These containers also have openings of various widths. Neither the conventional cubic or rectangular ice cubes, nor the various forms of ice cubes that the prior art teaches, are insertable within these containers because of the narrowness of the containers&apos; openings. Consequently these beverages can not be easily cooled in their containers by the addition of ice cubes or other frozen substances. The only way to cool these beverages while they are in their containers is to place them into a cool environment such as a refrigerator, freezer, ice box, ice bucket, cooler, tub of ice, or the like. However, the introduction of a beverage container into a very cold environment can lead to a messy result as the beverage container may rupture as the freezable substance within the container expands during freezing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when a straw is used to consume a beverage, the use of conventional ice cubes in the beverage does not achieve the advantages offered by the current invention. It is common knowledge that when ice is added to a beverage, the ice floats. Consequently, the upper, rather than the lower, portion of the beverage is cooled. When a straw is used to consume the beverage, the non-cooled lower portion of the beverage is sucked up through the straw and introduced into the consumer&apos;s mouth rather than the cooled upper portion of the beverage wherein the ice cubes reside. This is dissatisfying and contrary to the motives behind adding ice cubes to beverage containers; namely, consuming a cool beverage. The current invention solves this problem. The elongated form of the current invention assures that the frozen substance is narrow and insertable into a beverage container, beverage can, juice can, water bottle, sports bottle or the like and that the lower portion of the beverage, from which the beverage is consumed when the consumer uses a straw, is cooled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting the same, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show an individual disposable package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> show containers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the disposable packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> show the individual disposable packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Throughout this specification, the terms &ldquo;ice cube&rdquo; and &ldquo;ice cube tray&rdquo; will be used for convenience of the reader, even though the shape and form of the ice formed by the inventive structure is not cubic. In addition, while the invention will be referred to in the context of freezing water to form ice, any freezable substance is within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an individual disposable package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown having a top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A freezable substance is placed in the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed over the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to seal the package and prevent spillage of the freezable substance prior to its freezing. The top and the bottom portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each have a maximum width Wm of less than or equal to 0.625 inches (15.875 mm). The disposable package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a length X<highlight><subscript>l </subscript></highlight>of greater than or equal to 1.5 inches (38.1 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the freezable substance is placed in the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed over the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to seal the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, the top and bottom portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be sealed prior to placing the freezable substance in the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. After the top and bottom portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are sealed, the freezable substance can be placed in the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via at least one opening (not shown) that is located on either the top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (or at least two openings which are located on the top portion and the bottom portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively). The opening can then be sealed by any sealing means, such as, adhesives, pressure sealing, &ldquo;zip-loc&rdquo; mechanism or a lid, which seals the opening and prevents spillage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the ice cube is removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by separating the top and bottom portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from each other. However, the ice cube can be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by any means chosen with sound engineering judgment, such as those described herein-below with reference to the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprised of a single unit (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The maximum width Wm is important, as the primary goal of the invention is to cool drinks within their respective containers. Because most of the drink containers presently have interior diameters less than 0.625 inches (15.875 mm), the present invention provides a way to effectively cool the beverage within its original container. Further, because the ice cube is now &ldquo;narrow,&rdquo; and because cooling is a function of surface area, the length of the ice cube is necessarily lengthened in order to provide the requisite level of cooling. Therefore, in an ice cube formed by the inventive article, the depth X<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is greater than a conventional ice cube. Also because of the greater surface area afforded, the preferred form of the cavity is one that will provide a generally cylindrical shaped ice cube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing, another embodiment is contemplated wherein the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an inner width less than or equal to 0.875 inches (22.23 mm) at any point along its length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing, another embodiment is contemplated wherein the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an inner width less than or equal to 0.625 inches (15.875 mm) at any point along its length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the individual disposable package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is comprised of the top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but the disposable package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a single unit (not shown). However, the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed from a single tube having at least one opening. The opening can be located at any position on the tube that is chosen with sound engineering judgment. A freezable substance can be placed into the tube through the one opening and the tube can be sealed to prevent spillage of the freezable substance prior to its freezing. Any sealing means, such as, adhesives, pressure sealing, &ldquo;zip-loc&rdquo; mechanism or a lid, which seals the package and prevents spillage may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The ice cube can be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by any means that allows the ice tube to be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without breaking or other such damage. For example, one end of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be cut, torn, etc., to enable the ice cube to be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Or, a perforation could be located along either the width or the length of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which could be broken to enable the ice cube to be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed from polyethylene. However, any other polymeric substance that adequately holds the freezable substance, prevents spillage, and is capable of withstanding freezing temperatures without significant distortions or defects may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for holding the individual disposable packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a transparent container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> manufactured from a polymeric material, such as polyethylene. In the preferred embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will hold four (4) individual disposable packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The dimensions of the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will vary depending on the dimensions of the packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, a container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> holding four (4) packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a length of 4.50 inches (114.30 mm) and an outer width of 0.875 inches (22.23 mm) will have a length of 5.875 inches (141.00 mm), a width of 3.50 inches (88.90 mm) and a height of 0.938 inches (23.825 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is manufactured from a transparent polymeric material. However, the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be manufactured from any material which adequately holds the packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is capable of withstanding freezing temperatures without significant distortions or defects may be used. In addition, the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> does not have to be made of a clear transparent material. The container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a colored transparency, it may be opaque, or it may be a solid color. The color and transparency of the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is simply a matter of design preference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, a container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> holding four (4) individual disposable packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. However, the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may hold more than four (4) packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, or it may hold less than four (4) packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (not shown). Furthermore, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show the packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged in a single row, but the packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be placed in any stable arrangement, such as the double rows shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The inventive method of chilling a beverage within its original beverage container will now be described. In a typical beverage container, the lid is removed, typically by unscrewing the lid from the container via threads. An individual disposable package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from the container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and then the frozen substance is removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and inserted into the beverage container so that the longitudinal centerline of frozen substance is coaxial with the longitudinal centerline of the beverage container. The entire depth of the beverage is therefore cooled and chilled by the inventive article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the frozen substance will be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by removing the top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and squeezing the bottom portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to expel the frozen substance. However, different methods of removal may be used depending on the type of package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, if the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sealed, the frozen substance may be removed by tearing or cutting one end of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and squeezing the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to expel the frozen substance through the opening. Or, if the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a lid, the lid can be taken off and then the frozen substance can be removed from the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments have been described, hereinabove. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above methods may incorporate changes and modifications without departing from the general scope of this invention. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations in so far as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
