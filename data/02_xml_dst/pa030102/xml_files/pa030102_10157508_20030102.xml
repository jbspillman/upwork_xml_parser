<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for predicting the loading capability of an electrochemical element/battery by measuring the current I, voltage U and temperature T of the electrochemical element, and comparing the measured values with corresponding values of the response of an equivalent circuit diagram of the electrochemical element, the parameters of the components of the equivalent circuit diagram and the state variables being varied so that a match with the measured values is obtained and so that the loading capability is determined from the matched parameters and state variables. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For the use of batteries in applications with a high requirement for reliability, e.g., in vehicles, in which components of the brake or steering system are to be supplied with electricity, secure prediction regarding the instantaneous performance of the batteries is indispensable. It is, therefore, necessary to predict whether critical battery loading of the battery, occurring in the near future, can also be sustained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For a battery, it is known (Willibert Schleuter: etzArchiv volume 4 (1982) issue 7, pages 213-218; P. L&uuml;rkens, W. Steffens: etzArchiv volume 8 (1986) issue 7, pages 231-236) to assume an equivalent circuit diagram whose parameters are trained by analyzing the battery response during operation, and which then makes it possible to predict the future response. To that end, it is necessary to register the voltage and current of the battery constantly, and process them, e.g., in a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It would accordingly be advantageous to predict the likely voltage response of an electrical accumulator under given loading with an electrical current or an electrical power. To that end, it would be advantageous to have an equivalent electrical circuit diagram which, on the one hand, is accurate enough to describe details of the voltage response. On the other hand, it would also be advantageous to keep its number of free parameters, which need to be matched during operation, as small as possible to permit quick and unequivocal matching. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention is firstly suitable for electrochemical accumulators, i.e., so-called &ldquo;secondary elements&rdquo; or batteries, which can be repeatedly discharged and recharged. The invention is not restricted to these, however, but can also be used in non-rechargeable electrochemical elements, so-called &ldquo;primary elements&rdquo; or batteries. An accumulator will be discussed below, without intending thereby to restrict the invention to secondary stores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The idea according to the invention is that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> an equivalent circuit diagram with a particularly favorable form is set up; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> the parameters of this equivalent circuit diagram are continuously optimized by matching to continuously recorded measured values; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> by using the equivalent circuit diagram and the optimized parameters, the instantaneous loading capability, i.e., the response of the battery under a hypothetical load with an assumed current value I, is predicted by imposing this current value I on the equivalent circuit diagram with the found parameters and evaluating the voltage response calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This is based on an equivalent circuit diagram for the response of the voltage U of the accumulator of the form represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>-Uo-R-<highlight><subscript>RNL1</subscript></highlight>-(R<highlight><subscript>NL2</subscript></highlight>//C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)-C<highlight><subscript>S</subscript></highlight>-,&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> wherein Uo is the zero-current voltage, R is a resistance, and C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>are capacitances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The core of the invention is an improvement to the treatment of the nonlinear terms of the equivalent circuit diagram. The nonlinear terms R<highlight><subscript>NL1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>NL2 </subscript></highlight>can be optimally represented in the form of a dependency of the current i on the voltage u. A simplified form of the Butler-Volmer equation known from electrochemistry is then employed: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>i&equals;io</italic></highlight>*sin <highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>u/{circumflex over (u)}),</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> with the so-called &ldquo;exchange current density&rdquo; io (dimension: current) and the so-called &ldquo;Tafel slope&rdquo; &ucirc; (dimension: voltage). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Eq. 2 will be used below in the approximation for fairly large currents (i&gt;io): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>u</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>)&equals;<highlight><italic>&ucirc;*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(2/<highlight><italic>io</italic></highlight>)&plus;<highlight><italic>&ucirc;*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> or in the short form with Uo&prime;&equals;&ucirc;*1n(2/io): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>u</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>)&equals;<highlight><italic>Uo&prime;&plus;&ucirc;*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Normally, it is, therefore, necessary for the parameters Uo, R, C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>of the equivalent circuit diagram and, for each of the nonlinear resistances R<highlight><subscript>NL1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>NL2</subscript></highlight>, io and &ucirc; as well, to be &ldquo;trained&rdquo; from the current and voltage responses in the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Advantageous for good &ldquo;training&rdquo; are fairly large current variations (which usually occur, for example, during operation of the accumulator in a vehicle), as well as properties of the electrochemical system in question that possibly need to be taken into account. In the case of a lead-acid accumulator, for example, it is necessary for a sufficiently long phase with a persistent negative charge balance to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A further precondition is that the nature of the critical load to be predicted be known, so that it is possible to calculate the situation in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Explicit knowledge of the instantaneous state of charge (SOC) of the accumulator, however, is not generally necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The better an equivalent circuit diagram and the functions used to describe nonlinear components represent the battery situation, the more accurate a prediction can be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It has been shown that the method of this invention satisfies this condition very well, especially in the discharge range of lead-acid accumulators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In practice, finding the parameters of the nonlinear elements of the equivalent circuit diagram constitutes the greatest problem numerically, especially when the measurement accuracy of the large current and voltage is limited by measurement noise. This is the case, in particular, whenever the value range of the measured quantities is too small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention overcomes these problems. It resorts to the practical experience that in many battery systems (for example in lead-acid accumulators, lithium cells, NiCd cells) the voltage response of the nonlinear elements at fairly high currents can be represented as a function of the current i by a relationship of the form </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>U</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>NL</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;Uo&prime;&plus;&ucirc;*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>).&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this case, &ucirc;, the Tafel slope of Eq. 2, is a constant which may depend to a greater or lesser extent also on the temperature according to the battery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention includes specifying the nonlinear elements in a fixed way as functions &ucirc;*1n(i) dependent only on the current. In other words: parameter matching for the voltage U of the accumulator is carried out not on the complete equivalent circuit diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but only on a reduced equivalent circuit diagram of the form represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>-Uo-R-C<highlight><subscript>S</subscript></highlight>-,&emsp;&emsp;(4) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> although instead of the measured battery voltage U, the corrected quantity U&plus;U<highlight><subscript>NL </subscript></highlight>is applied to take into account the nonlinear terms, that is to say a term of the form </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>U&prime;&equals;U&plus;&ucirc;*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(4a) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> in the aforementioned simplest case, with the approximation mentioned above for fairly large currents i&gt;io being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Instead of the many parameters of the equivalent circuit diagram represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, some of which are difficult to match unequivocally because of their strong correlation, only the three parameters Uo, R, C<highlight><subscript>S</subscript></highlight>, hence, need to be matched according to the invention. The Tafel slope &ucirc; is specified as an optionally temperature-dependent quantity, and is not matched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The input voltage U&prime; of the equivalent circuit diagram is, hence, a voltage that is corrected with respect to the measured battery voltage U and the correction function contains as variables only the current I, the voltage U and the temperature T and as a nonlinear term a logarithmic dependency on I. By using the equivalent circuit diagram, the instantaneous loading capability, i.e., the response of the battery under a hypothetical load with an assumed current value I, is predicted by imposing this current value I on the equivalent circuit diagram with the found parameters and evaluating the voltage response calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Numerical values for a lead-acid accumulator will be indicated below by way of example. The claimed method also applies, with modified numerical values, to other battery systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For a 6-cell battery unit, the value of &ucirc; lies, e.g., at approximately 0.1 V, and can be selected approximately from the 0.02 to 0.3 V range. The preferred value lies at about 0.13 V, i.e., about 21 mV per cell. The parameter &ucirc; generally lies in the value range of from about 5 to about 50 mV per cell, preferably in the value range of from about 10 to about 30 mV per cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For slow load changes on the battery (for instance less than about 0.1 Hz), the method can already be used well in this form with only one nonlinear term. The underlying equivalent circuit diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a simplification of that represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with the nonlinear term R<highlight><subscript>NL1 </subscript></highlight>being catered for by the correction of the voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For faster changes, a further improvement is possible by taking two nonlinear terms R<highlight><subscript>NL1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>NL2</subscript></highlight>//C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into account according to the equivalent circuit diagram represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>U</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>NL</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;Uo&prime;&plus;&ucirc;</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>*1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>)&plus;&ucirc;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>*1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>&icirc;</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In this case, the time constant &tgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for the filtered current &icirc;(t) at time t is calculated using the previous value of the filtered current &icirc;(t&minus;dt) at the preceding time t&minus;dt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The quantity Q in (5a) stands for the capacity of the accumulator. a<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is a constant of the order of a<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.3, although it may also be selected in the about 0.05 to about 2.0 range for a lead-acid accumulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In general, the constant a<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for calculating the time constant &tgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;a<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>*Q/&icirc; lies in the value range of from about 0.05 to about 2.0, preferably in the range of from about 0.1 to about 0.5, and the parameters &ucirc;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &ucirc;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively, lie approximately in the value range of from about 3 to about 30 mV per cell, preferably in the value range of from about to about 20 mV per cell, and particularly preferably in the value range of from about 7 to about 15 mV per cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The numerical low-pass filtering of the flowing current can be carried out by means of software or hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> One numerical possibility consists in calculating the output value F(I, t<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) of the filter in the time step n in a weighted fashion from the present current value I(t<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) and the output value F(I, t<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>) of the filter in the preceding time step n&minus;1 </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In general, the parameter a<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the time constant &tgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;a<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>*Q/&icirc;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>lies in the value range of from about 0.005 to about 0.2, preferably at approximately 0.05, and the parameter a<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the time constant &tgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;a<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>*Q/&icirc;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>lies in the value range of from about 0.05 to about 2, preferably in the value range of from about 0.1 to about 0.5. The parameters &ucirc;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &ucirc;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively, lie approximately in the value range of from about 3 to about 30 mV per cell, preferably in the value range of from about 5 to about 20 mV per cell, and particularly preferably in the value range of from about 7 to about 15 mV per cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The equivalent circuit diagrams represented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> do not describe all the response modes of an accumulator. Since the current/voltage responses, for example, in a lead-acid accumulator are influenced by additional mechanisms during and after charging, according to the invention a selection is made among the measured-value pairs (U, I) employed for the method. The aim is to ensure that, in particular, nonequilibrium states of the electrodes resulting from previous charging phases have already decayed because the use of measured-value pairs (U, I) from such states in conjunction with the equivalent circuit diagrams represented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can lead to false results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In particular, only such measured-value pairs (U, I) are used as lie in a discharge phase, i.e., in which the present current and the current in the preceding measurement are less than zero. It is furthermore ensured that any preceding charging phase (with current values greater than zero) took place sufficiently long ago. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Since the last charging, a charge quantity of at least about 3%, preferably at least about 5% of the capacity of the lead-acid accumulator should have discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Since, in time ranges that are unsuitable for evaluation, for instance quite soon after charging or in the voltage collapse zone of the battery during discharge, the capacitance Cs that is determined takes very small values, the points of a sufficiently negative charge balance can actually be identified by the fact that the matched quantity Cs is greater than a limit value, which is e.g. 3 Ah/V/100 Ah for a 6-cell battery, i.e., 18 Ah/V/cell of 100 Ah capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the quantity Uo is closely related to the thermodynamically balanced open-circuit voltage Uoo of the accumulator. For the difference Uoo-Uo, it is possible to provide a function that generally depends only on the temperature, which can advantageously be written in the form </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Uoo&minus;Uo&plus;a&minus;b/T&minus;c*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(8) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> and also depends only on the battery type. In this case, a, b and c are constants and T is the absolute temperature, measured in K, and Q is the capacity of the accumulator, measured in Ah. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For a lead-acid accumulator with a rated voltage of 12 V, the following applies, for example </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Uoo&minus;Uo&equals;&minus;</italic></highlight>1.03 <highlight><italic>V&plus;</italic></highlight>478.8 <highlight><italic>V/T&minus;</italic></highlight>0.13 <highlight><italic>V*</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>).&emsp;&emsp;(8a) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This relationship of Uo to the thermodynamically balanced open-circuit voltage Uoo of the accumulator makes it possible, in the case of a lead-acid accumulator, to deduce its charging state, because Uoo is linked to it in a way which depends on the construction but is always unequivocal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, the following may be written for the temperature dependency of the steady-state Tafel slope u of a 6-cell lead-acid accumulator in V: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>&ucirc;&equals;</italic></highlight>0.088 <highlight><italic>V&plus;</italic></highlight>0.046 <highlight><italic>V*exp</italic></highlight>(&minus;0.041*<highlight><italic>TC</italic></highlight>).&emsp;&emsp;(9) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this case, TC is the temperature measured in &deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Once the parameters of the components of the equivalent circuit diagram have been found, as described above, then according to the invention it is possible to predict the instantaneous loading capability, i.e., the response of the battery under a hypothetical load with an assumed current value I, by imposing this current value I on the equivalent circuit diagram with the found parameters and evaluating the voltage response calculated. In this case, the current value I(t) may be either constant or dependent on the time t. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The voltage response U(t) calculated in this way is used according to the invention for assessing the electrical loading capability. For example, the electrical power that the accumulator is capable of delivering can be calculated as the product of an assumed imposed current value I(t) and a calculated voltage response U(t). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The use of the matched value Uo directly as an indication that the accumulator has previously been drained is furthermore part of the invention. This previous draining is assumed if Uo exceeds a threshold value Ulimit, depending on the temperature T, during discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the case of a lead-acid accumulator with 6 cells in series, this threshold value for Uo during discharge lies in the value range of from approximately 11.7 V for 60&deg; C. to approximately 12.2 V for &minus;30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In general, the threshold value Ulimit, depending on the temperature T, is approximately 2.03 /cell &plusmn;0.03 V/cell at &minus;30&deg; C. and approximately 1.95 /cell &plusmn;0.03 V/cell at 60&deg; C., preferably approximately 2.03 V/cell &plus;0.01 V/cell at &minus;30&deg; C. and approximately 1.95 V/cell &plusmn;0.01 V/cell at 60&deg; C. For other temperatures, a linear dependency of the threshold value Ulimit on the temperature is assumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Another indication that the battery has previously been drained is that the calculated matching parameters for the measurement, in particular the matching parameter for the resistance R, changes greatly in a short time. The failure of an individual cell when a plurality of cells are connected in series can be noticed, inter alia, by the fast decrease dUo/dt of the matched quantity Uo as a function of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The fact that the magnitude &verbar;dP/dq&verbar; of the rate of change of one of the matching parameters P (P&equals;Uo,R,Cs) with the transferred charge quantity q exceeds a limit value is used as an indication that the accumulator has previously been drained. Whenever &verbar;dP/dq&verbar; exceeds a threshold value &verbar;dP/dq&verbar; limit, this is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In a lead-acid accumulator, the matching parameter P preferably involves the parameter R of the equivalent circuit diagram, and &verbar;dR/dq&verbar; limit for the lead-acid accumulator is at least approximately 3 times as great as the original value of &verbar;dR/dq&verbar; for the accumulator when fully charged. </paragraph>
