<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of the dual-purpose connector assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown to comprise a stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a first electrical connector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, an electrical cable <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a second electrical connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> adapted to be placed on a table surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a prop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a lower end <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> connected to the base <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and an upper end <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> opposite to the lower end <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> along a vertical axis. The base <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can be secured on the table surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the use of a hook-and-loop fastener or by means of an adhesive tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The prop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed with a first cable passage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that extends from the upper end <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to the lower end <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has a surrounding wall <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, and is formed with a second cable passage <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> that extends from the first cable passage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the surrounding wall <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The first electrical connector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is mounted on the upper end <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the prop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and is adapted to connect electrically with an output port <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a peripheral device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to mount the peripheral device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The electrical cable <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> connected to the first electrical connector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a second end <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> opposite to the first end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The electrical cable <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends through the first and second cable passages <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> such that the second end <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of the electrical cable <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is disposed outwardly of the stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The second electrical connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the second end <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of the electrical cable <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and is adapted to connect electrically with an electronic device (not shown), such as a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the upper end <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the prop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed with a connector mounting space <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>&prime; that extends along the vertical axis and that is communicated with the first cable passage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The first electrical connector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> has a mounting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>&prime; mounted fixedly in the connector mounting space <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>&prime;, and a coupling portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> that extends from the mounting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>&prime;, that is disposed outwardly of the stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and that is adapted to be connected to the peripheral device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As the connector assembly of the present invention can be neatly disposed on the table surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, storage of the same is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the prop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is flexible and is capable of being retained at a flexed state relative to the vertical axis in a known manner, such that the peripheral device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be retained at a suitable position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It has thus been shown that the connector assembly of this invention not only permits connection of the peripheral device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the electronic device, but can also support the peripheral device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at a suitable position relative to the table surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The object of this invention is thus met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in connection with what is considered the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretations and equivalent arrangements. </paragraph>
