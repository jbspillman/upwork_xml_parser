<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a monolever operating device, and more particularly, to a monolever operating device, which is excellent in abrasion resistance, good in durability and high in reliability and can be conformed to many kinds of machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Inventions have been already known relating to an operating lever device, in which a single operating lever (referred below to as a &ldquo;monolever&rdquo;) is operatively inclined to generate an operating signal and two hydraulic actuators are drivingly controlled on the basis of the operating signal. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 89515/1997 discloses an electrical type operating lever device, in which a monolever is operatively inclined to have each of four pistons issuing an electric signal representative of its displacement. Two hydraulic actuators can be drivingly controlled on the basis of an electric signal issued from the electrical type operating lever device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 49167/1995 discloses a hydraulic type operating lever device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which outputs a hydraulic signal. In this publication, the hydraulic type operating lever device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> having four pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which are pressed upon inclination of a monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a front and rear direction and in a right and left direction, and of which respective displacements are output as hydraulic signals, on the basis of which two hydraulic actuators can be drivingly controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With the hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, four pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), which constitute a piston <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, are arranged in equidistant positions on a circumference in a manner to abut against a disk plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> mounted on the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The four pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are pushed and displaced by the disk plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in accordance with an orientation and an amount of inclination of the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Hydraulic pressure generating means Hd for generating a hydraulic signal of a magnitude corresponding to respective displacements of the pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are provided on the hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. In addition, the hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> comprises a drive signal generating body and the hydraulic pressure generating means Hd comprise a drive signal generating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is mounted to the hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> through a universal joint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is mounted on a mount plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and on a vehicle body <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> near a driver seat by means of bolts <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> extending through vehicle body bolt holes <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the mount plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the mount plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided with a ring-shaped stopper projection <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, which in turn is provided with arcuate-shaped projections <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>adapted to abut against the disk plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to restrict an inclination &thgr; of the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The mount plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided with an annular groove <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on an outer periphery of the ring-shaped stopper projection <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. One end of a boot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> covering the four pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is inserted into the annular groove <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Also, the other end of the boot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is inserted into an annular groove <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided on an outer periphery of a coupling <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, which connects the universal joint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the operating lever device constituted in the above manner has been improved in operability and made small in size to be used in many construction machines and industrial machinery such as small-sized and large-sized hydraulic shovels, bulldozers, rough terrain cranes and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With the above constitution, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 49167/1995 proposes the provision of a single mount plate for parts to improve an increase in cost, caused by an increased number of parts due to the fact that a part for mounting of a boot is separate from a mount plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, since the operating lever device has been used in many construction machines and industrial machinery in recent years as described above, the mount plate shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) differ in configuration and dimension of inclination every machine, and so manufacture of the single mount plate necessitates a new metallic mold to lead to an increase in cost of parts and a large amount of expense in manufacture of a metallic mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For example, the mount plate is fabricated froma sintered material to shape the projection for stoppage and the arcuate projection in order to facilitate manufacture and realize cost reduction. There is caused a problem that a metallic mold for manufacture of the sintered material is increased in manufacture cost since an annular groove is provided on a side of the mount plate and manhour in assembling is increased at the time of manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, since the mount plate is fabricated from a sintered material, the projection for stoppage and adapted to abut against the disk plate is worn. Such wear causes a problem that the operating lever device becomes hard to operate because an operating lever is increased in stroke after use over a long term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When the projection for stoppage is further increased in thickness in order to prevent the wear, there is caused a problem that the operating lever device becomes large and so difficult in use for small-sized construction machines or a major part of the device must be made large to impose a limitation on a driver seat. Also, a part for mounting of a boot and a mount plate are conventionally separate from each other, and so there is caused a problem that the boot is worsened in assembling property and cost is increased since the part does not function as a bearing portion for inclination of the operating lever and so other part is needed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention has been thought of in view of the above problems, relates to a monolever operating device and has its object to provide a monolever operating device, which is favorable in assembling property and susceptible of less wear and can be made small in size and inexpensively conformed to many kinds of machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the above objects, a monolever operating device according to the invention comprises a monolever capable of inclining in a two-dimensional optional direction conformed to at least a front and rear direction and a right and left direction, drive signal generating means received in a drive signal generating body to output two drive signals to components in the front and rear direction and in the right and left direction in accordance with an orientation and an amount of inclination of the monolever, a universal joint mounted on the drive signal generating body to support the monolever in an inclinable manner, a mount plate for mounting the drive signal generating body mounted thereto to a vehicle body, a boot provided between the monolever and the mount plate to cover the drive signal generating means, and a monolever bearing member provided on an upper surface of the mount plate and provided with lever bearing portions and boot holding portions alternately arranged adjacent to each other in a circumferential direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this case, the monolever bearing member comprises a press formed part of a low-carbon steel material subjected to carburization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also, the monolever bearing member may comprise lever bearing portions provided perpendicular to a surface thereof being mounted on the mount plate and boot holding portions provided in parallel to the surface to hole the boot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also, slits may be provided between the lever bearing portions and the boot holding portions of the monolever bearing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, the lever bearing portions of the monolever bearing member may be formed to be arcuate Ra as viewed in plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With the above constitution, the monolever operating device comprises a mount plate for mounting the drive signal generating body to a vehicle body and a monolever stopping member for stopping an inclination of the monolever, and the arrangement is alternate on a circumference, whereby insertion of the boot into the monolever stopping member is facilitated and assembling is made easy to achieve reduction in manhour in assembling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Also, the monolever stopping member is made a single part whereby the monolever stopping member having a plurality of configurations can be subjected to drawing in one step to reduce cost for a metallic mold. Also, the monolever stopping member is made a single part whereby a monolever operating device capable of conforming to many kinds of machines can be provided by preparing a plurality of monolever stopping members having different sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The monolever bearing member is formed from a low-carbon steel material subjected to carburization to be increased in hardness, so that the lever bearing portions are reduced in wear, by which the performance can be prevented from changing after use over a long term. Also, fabrication is made by means of press work to thereby achieve reduction in manhour in work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The monolever bearing member is composed of the lever bearing portions and the boot holding portions, so that a demand for a design value with a different inclination can be accommodated for by modifying a length of a sheet material for the lever bearing portions. Also, even when a length of the lever bearing portions is modified at the time of press work, a metallic mold can be readily manufactured to reduce cost for manufacture of the mold and facilitate management of the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With the monolever bearing member, the slits are provided between the lever bearing portions and the boot holding portions of the monolever bearing member, whereby the lever bearing portions and the boot holding portions can be arranged alternately adjacent to each other in a circumferential direction, and press work can be performed with ease. At this time, the slits are extended inward from bent portions to thereby facilitate drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The lever bearing portions of the monolever bearing member are formed to be arcuate as viewed in plan view, so that the lever bearing portions are made high in allowable bending stress and so can be made thin to achieve miniaturization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, the monolever bearing member is structured such that the lever bearing portions and the boot holding portions are arranged alternately adjacent to each other in a circumferential direction with the slits therebetween, a low-carbon steel material is subjected to carburization for an increased hardness, and the lever bearing portions are formed to be arcuate. Thereby, even when being made small in plate thickness, the monolever bearing member is enhanced in abrasion resistance and allowable bending stress, mounting of the boot is facilitated, the same metallic mold complies with a demand for a variety of inclinations, and press work is enabled, whereby work and assembling are facilitated, miniaturization is achieved, and a change in performance after use over a long term can be decreased. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The mount plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed on an upper surface of the valve body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and then the monolever bearing member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is overlapped and laid on the mount plate and mounted to the valve body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hydraulic body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by means of bolts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>.

At this time, the boot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is easily inserted into a first one of the boot holding portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> since the lever bearing portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on both sides of the first one is provided in a withdrawn manner.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, an upper portion of the boot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is inserted into an annular groove <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the coupling <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and thus assembling is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, an explanation will be given to operation of the above constitution. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a state, in which the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is not inclined but centrally positioned in a neutral position Mn, in which any hydraulic pressure is not generated from the hydraulic pressure generating means Hd. Suppose, for example, that the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is operated to be inclined to a maximum position Mm in the right and left direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Accompanying this inclination, the disk plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> mounted on the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is inclined to abut against the peak Pa of the semi-circular projection of the lever bearing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be stopped, while pushing the piston <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At this time, the lever bearing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is subjected to a bending force from the disk plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> but the lever bearing portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are formed to be arcuate to be made high in allowable bending stress and so can be made thin as compared with the prior art. When the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is turned at a maximum inclination &thgr;m, the piston <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is pushed to the maximum and the hydraulic pressure generating means Hd generates a maximum hydraulic pressure corresponding to a maximum displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Whenever the monolever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is operated at the maximum inclination &thgr;m in the above manner, the disk plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> abuts against the peak Pa of the semi-circular projection of the lever bearing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Since the monolever bearing member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment to be increased in hardness and enhanced in abrasion resistance, it is susceptible of less wear, which eliminates a change in the maximum inclination even after use over a long term. Thereby, there is caused no change in maximum running speed, turning speed and the like, and operability experiences no change from the first to make operation easy in the same manner as at the time of shipping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> While the above explanation has been given to the right and left direction, the same results can be obtained with respect to the front and rear direction. Also, while an explanation has been given to the above embodiment, in which the pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are arranged on perpendicular lines in the X-axis direction (for example, a right and left direction) and the Y-axis direction (for example, a front and rear direction), another embodiment may be adopted, in which the pistons <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are arranged to be offset 45 degrees from the perpendicular lines in the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction. Also, while an explanation has been given to the above embodiment by way of the hydraulic monolever operating device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the above arrangement can be used in an electrical type operating lever device, in which a single operating lever is operatively inclined to have each of four pistons issuing an electric signal representative of its displacement, as in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 89515/1997. </paragraph>
