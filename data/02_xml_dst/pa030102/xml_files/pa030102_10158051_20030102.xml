<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The content of my co-pending U.S. patent application, filed on even date herewith, entitled &ldquo;Methods and Apparatus for a Linear Guiding Device&rdquo;, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to apparatus and methods for control of a material processing or bevel device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Automated multi-axis machines and the like can be used for processing workpieces. Typical processes that multi-axis machines can be used for, are cutting and welding workpieces. In one embodiment, workpieces can be cut by attaching a plasma arc torch to a multi-axis machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One problem with placing a plasma arc torch on a multi-axis machine is that supply lines (e.g., gas hoses and electrical cables) for the plasma arc torch, which supply shield gas and current to the torch, can become twisted or strained during operation of the multi-axis machine. Currently, when the torch is translated/rotated to a desired cutting position, the machine must retrace its movement so that the torch supply lines are unravelled as the torch is reset to its starting position. The twisting of torch supply lines limits their life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One method to improve the life of the supply lines is to pass each component of the lines through a rotational device. For the cables which supply current to the torch, a slip ring can be used as a rotational device. For the hoses which supply gas to the torch, a mechanical seal type rotational device can be used. These devices, however, are costly to install and maintain and have limited useful lives. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be attached to a travelling head (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) which is attached to a further structure (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) slidably mounted on an overhead gantry structure (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) straddling a work piece (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) sitting on a cutting table (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). The gantry (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) can be moveable on a fixed base (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). A control mechanism (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) can be any known mechanism which enables programming of various operation and can also be used to control the various movements required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Therefore the invention provides a device being a multi-axis machine apparatus for the control of the motion of a material processing device. The material processing device has supply means (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and the apparatus has a supply co-ordination means wherein the motion of the processing device (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) can be coordinated with the motion of the apparatus such that the loading or twisting forces on the supply means (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) is substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The supply co-ordination means includes an upper assembly and a lower assembly wherein the upper assembly includes an angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for controlling vertical angular rotation of the processing device and includes a rotator housing assembly (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) &amp; (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) for supporting the horizontal rotation of the processing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A linear actuator for example an angle drive motor (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is used to drive an angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) vertically via a rack and pinion drive (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). The angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is constrained to move in the vertical direction by the use of a linear guide (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). Supply lines (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) to a cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) pass through the angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> An angle drive rotator bearing (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is connected to the end of the angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is connected to a first race or inner race (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the angle drive rotator bearing (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). A vertical output shaft (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is connected to a second race or outer race (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the angle drive rotator bearing (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The vertical output shaft (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is constrained to a linear movement via a vertical output shaft guide slider (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). The vertical output shaft guide slider (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is connected to a push rod (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) that in turn is connected to the cutting head mount plate (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). An actuator for example a motor (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is used to drive the housing (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) rotationally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The cutting head mount plate (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and a cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) are attached to an angle roller guide (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The angle roller guide (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is a curved track in which rollers are constrained. As the rollers are pushed along this track by the push rod (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), the cutting head mount plate (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>), which are connected to the rollers, are moved along the angle roller guide (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to a desired angle, between about 0 degrees and 45 degrees in the embodiment shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The angle roller guide (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) can be made so that the center of rotation of the cutting mechanism is co-incident with the center of the rotating mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). This allows for the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) to angle over and rotate without the requirement for the machine X, Y, Z axis to move to maintain the same virtual point of intersection with the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The rotator housing (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) of a multi-axis machine is mounted to a rotator drive bearing (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The rotator drive bearing (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) allows the rotator motor (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) to drive the rotator housing (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) via the rotator drive belt (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and rotate the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) to a desired rotational angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The angle drive motor (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) drives the angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) down, which causes the output shaft guide slider (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) to be driven down by the vertical output shaft (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). The motion of the output shaft guide slider (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) causes the push rod (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) to push the cutting head mount plate (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) along the angle roller guide (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). This allows the angle of the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) to be set independent of the rotational axis of the multi-axis machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It should be noted the angle of the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) relative to vertical has a relationship with the angular movement of the angle drive motor (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The rotator drive bearing (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) and the angle drive rotator bearing (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) ensure that the angle drive mechanism is able to move the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) to an angle independent of the rotation of the rotator housing (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) and the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The distance the angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) moves downward provides the amount of additional length of supply cables and lines required, which in turn allow the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) to rotate over to the maximum angle required. This eliminates the need for supply lines to slide through the angle drive mechanism as the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) angles over. The supply lines can be fixed to the top of the angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The invention further includes a flexible drive to eliminate twisting of supply lines to the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>), which in one embodiment can be a plasma arc torch. This drive system is used to provide protected delivery of the supply cables and services to the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Elimination of twisting of the supply lines is achieved by keeping the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) and the machine frame, i.e. the rotator housing (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), in their relative positions, regardless of the cutting mechanisms (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) angle or rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A drive gear (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is mounted to a rotationally stationary item, namely angle drive mechanism (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). A pinion (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) mounted onto a first end of a flexible drive shaft (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) engages the drive gear (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). The second end of the flexible drive shaft (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) has a driven or following pinion (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) that engages a following gear (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). The cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) is held in a cutting head mount bearing (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), where the inner bearing race holds both the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) and the following gear (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As the rotator housing (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), cuffing mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>), and angle roller guide (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) rotate, driven by the rotator motor (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) via the rotator belt drive (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>), the drive gear (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is held stationary. As the flexible shaft (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) has pinions with the same number of teeth on both ends, the following gear (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) is also held rotationally stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> This assembly is therefore able to rotate continuously without the service leads being twisted or torsionally loaded. This enables services such as current and gas to be continuously supplied to the cutting mechanism (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) without the service lines being subject to detrimental torque. This also eliminates the requirement for the rotational drive to unwind, since the supply services are not twisted when the cutting mechanism is positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Operatively the flexible drive works substantially using the following sequence of steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> 1. First the rotator motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is initiated; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> 2. This rotates the rotator housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> supported by bearing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> 3. This rotates the vertical output shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and cutting mech support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> horizontally as they are all mounted on to the rotator housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 4. This rotates the angle rotator bearing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> &ldquo;housing&rdquo; (no number see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) relative to the fixed upper drive gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which causes the upper pinion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the flexible shaft to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 5. This in turn rotates the lower following pinion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the flexible drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a same amount which in turn counter-rotates the following gear <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which holds the cutting mechanism horizontally rotationally static. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> 6. This rotationally static result is what eliminates any windup in the supply lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 7. A change in the rotation direction simply reverses the counter-rotation direction leaving the supply lines free from windup </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Power requirements do not change the design, being subject solely to the acceptable bend radius for the service supply lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the current invention would allow laser bevel cutting with the use of rotational mirror joints to eliminate the bending of the services supply lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In summary, the current invention allows a torch or other material processing device to be mounted in a bearing. Using the flexible drive eliminates the twisting of service cables to the material processing device. In addition, the angle drive mechanism of the current invention also controls the bending angle of the material processing device, the angle being infinitely adjustable within its full range of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Throughout the description of this specification the word &ldquo;comprise&rdquo; and variations of that word, such as &ldquo;comprising&rdquo;, are not intended to exclude other additives, components, integers or steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Advantage of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The coordination means and method has the following advantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> 1. Elimination of twisting of supply lines; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> 2. Rotation in several axes; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> 3. Rotation independently operable; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> 4. Flexible drive mechanism. </paragraph>
