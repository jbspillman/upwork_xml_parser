<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to line-winding spools. More specifically, the present invention relates to spools rotatably mounted via a bearing on the spool shaft in spinning-reels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Spinning reels in general are equipped with a reel unit rotatably carrying a handle, a line-guiding rotor mounted rotatably in the reel unit, and a spool around which fishing line guided by the rotor is wound. The spinning-reel spool is shiftable front and back relative to the reel unit and includes: a bobbin trunk around which the fishing line winds; a front flange having a larger outer diameter than the outer diameter of the bobbin trunk and disposed on the front end of the bobbin trunk; and a round cylindrical skirt portin provided at the rear of the bobbin trunk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With spools of this sort, in order to reduce costs and design for an overall lighter weight spool, it is known to form the bobbin trunk from materials such as synthetic resin. Likewise, in order to improve drag performance it is known to mount the bobbin trunk rotatably on the spool shaft via a bearing. The bearing is fitted in between the spool shaft and the inner-circumferential surface of the bobbin trunk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Issues Invention is to Solve </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the aforementioned conventional synthetic-resin-manufactured spools carried on the spool shaft via a bearing, the fact that the bobbin trunk is made of plastic, which is comparatively low in strength. risks that when fishing line is wound on powerfully and compressive forces act on the bobbin trunk, the bobbin trunk will compressively deform. A compressively deformed bobbin trunk makes it hard to pull out the bearing fitted to the inner circumferential surface of the bobbin trunk, making it difficult to take out and replace the bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, there exists a need for spools which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to make it easier to take out and replace the spool bearing in spinning reels despite effects of compressive force on the bobbin trunk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A spool in accordance with the first aspect of the invention is mounted rotatably via a bearing on the spool shaft in a spinning-reel, and the spool is furnished with a bearing housing, a bobbin trunk, and front and rear flanges. At least a part of where the bearing housing houses the bearing is made of metal. The bobbin trunk, in which the bearing housing is provided and outer-circumferentially onto which fishing line wraps, is manufactured of a synthetic resin. The front and rear flanges are larger in diameter than, and disposed on the front and rear of, the bobbin trunk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The bobbin trunk in this spool is made of a synthetic resin in order to reduce its cost and design for lightened weight. Nevertheless, the bearing housing provided in the bobbin trunk is reinforced taking strength into consideration, by making it at least in part of a metal whose strength is higher than that of the synthetic resin. Herein, the fact that the bearing housing is reinforced by making it at least in part of a metal whose strength is higher than that of the synthetic resin means that the bearing housing is not liable to get compressed, and that even should compressive force have an effect on the bobbin trunk, taking out and replacing the spool bearing will be easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the second aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in the first aspect, further furnished with a skirt extending rearward from the outer circumferential part of the rear flange portion. This is to cover the periphery of the rotor for preventing the fishing line from snarling, even with the diameter of the bobbin trunk being smaller than the diameter of the round cylindrical portion of the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the third aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in the first or second aspect, wherein the bearing housing has a first tubular portion made of metal, in which the bearing is housed. The first tubular portion made of metal reinforces the tubular bobbin trunk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the fourth aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in the third aspect, wherein the bearing housing has a second tubular portion made of a synthetic resin, covering said first tubular portion. With this structure, it is possible to lighten its weight while reducing its cost, compared to manufacturing the bearing housing entirely of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the fifth aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in third or fourth aspect, wherein the bearing housing portion includes a circular plate portion formed integrally with the first tubular portion and fixedly coupled to a rear face of the bobbin trunk. In this case, since the first tubular portion and the circular portion are formed integrally, the circular portion can strengthen the first tubular portion and the tubular bobbin trunk at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the sixth aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in the first or second aspect, wherein the bearing housing in its entirety is made of metal. In this case, the strength of the bearing housing is heightened further because it is entirely made of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the seventh aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in one of the first through the sixth aspects, wherein at least a part of the bearing housing is formed integrally with the rear flange. In this case, the fact that the metal-manufactured bearing housing and the rear flange are formed integrally enables dual reinforcement of the rear portion of the bobbin trunk </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the eighth aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in any of the second through seventh aspects, wherein the bobbin trunk where fishing line wraps onto it outer-circumferentially is covered by a sheathing member made of sheet metal. In this case, the fact that the surface of the plastic bobbin trunk&mdash;which serves to lighten the weight and reduce costs&mdash;is encased by the sheathing member lends the outward appearance the classic feel of metallic luster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A spinning-reel spool in accordance with the ninth aspect of the invention is the spool set forth in the eighth aspect, wherein the skirt is formed integrally with the sheathing member. In this case, the outward appearance, reaching from the periphery of the bobbin trunk to the prominent skirt, is lent the classic feel of metallic luster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>

The first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and the circular plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>are press-formed integrally with the rear flange portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the skirt portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The press-formed rear flange portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>including the circular plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is fixed to the rear face of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by mounting screws <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The second tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, which is a part of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that projects rearward from the rear face of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is synthetic resin in manufacture, and is formed integrally with the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The outer race of bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is fitted inside the first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Likewise, the inner race of bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is mounted onto the bearing support part <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. A lock washer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> restrains the rear edge of the bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> inner race against shifting rearward. When the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached/reattached, bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> comes undone from the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and remains with the bearing support part <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. With this structure, even when the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is compressively deformed, the bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is less likely to come out of the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Nonetheless, because the metal-manufactured first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is furnished in the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is fitted into the first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will not be susceptible to compressive deformation, meaning that bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> will come out of the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>easily. Moreover, the strength is fortified by the fact that the first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and the circular plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>are formed as a single unitary tubular portion integrally with the rear flange portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the skirt portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> means, making deformation even less likely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The rear flange portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is an annular component manufactured of stainless steel, on which a curling process has been carried out to bend it back rearward. The front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is screw-fixed to the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also fastened to the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by means of the flange-fastening member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A reinforcing member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> made of metal is fitted in between the front end of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The flange-fastening member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is made to be screw-fastened to the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that the flange-fastening member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> clasps the front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the front end of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Here, female-threaded holes in the flange-fastening member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are arranged in positions to be out of alignment with female-threaded holes in the front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is for example a ring-shaped plate component made of metal. Through-holes that communicate with female-threaded holes in the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the flange-fastening member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed in a number of places in the reinforcing member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The reinforcing member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided in order to prevent fishing line from getting pinched under the front flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>due to compressive deformation of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The outer periphery of the reinforcing member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is in contact with the rim of a round recess formed in the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The skirt portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is a component made of metal, formed integrally with the rear flange portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as described earlier. The skirt portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is disposed so as to cover over the round cylinder portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as such, installing the reinforcing member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> made of metal on the front part of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and meanwhile installing the rear flange portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the rear part enables sustaining high strength in the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Likewise, because the first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, made of metal, is furnished in the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, mounting/dismounting the bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> will be easy even if the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> compressively deforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, the procedure for detaching/reattaching the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When the spool is to be taken out, a drag knob on the drag mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is twisted counterclockwise and taken off the spool shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Doing so releases the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the spool shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Then, as described earlier, bearing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comes undone from the bearing support part <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> together with the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> remains on the bearing support part <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in removing bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, because the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is reinforced by the first tubular portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, even if fishing line is wound forcefully onto the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will not be susceptible to compressive deformation. This therefore eases drawing bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> out from the spool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> (a) The rear flange and the second bearing housing are formed integrally in the foregoing embodiment, but they may be formed separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> made, e.g., of an aluminum alloy covers the outer periphery of a bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The outer circumferential surface of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in outward appearance thereby has a metallic luster, lending it a classic feel. The outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is press-formed integrally with a rear flange portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a skirt portion <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the press-worked article including the outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> constitutes a large-small, dual-stage tubular component. This press-worked article is fixed to the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> by means of screws <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the rear flange portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The front rim of the outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is inserted into an annular groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed in a front flange <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This is to restrain deformation of the fore end of the outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A second bearing housing <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a component obtained for example by press-forming a thin plate material of aluminum alloy manufacture, has a tubular portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>disposed encompassing bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and a circular plate portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>formed integrally with the tubular portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and fixedly coupled to the rear face of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the second bearing housing <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is made of metal. The second bearing housing <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>reinforces the area in which the bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is housed, reinforcing the rear of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at the same time. Specifically, the circular plate portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is fitted to the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> by engagement into an annular channel formed in its rear face, whereby the plastic bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is reinforced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> (b) The outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the rear flange portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed integrally in the foregoing alternate embodiment, but an outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> may be formed in a single, unitary tube shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, manufactured of, e.g., an aluminum alloy, has a circular plate portion <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a tubular portion <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed integrally with the circular plate portion <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and disposed on the outer circumferential surface of a bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The rear rim of the tubular portion <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is inserted into an annular groove <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed in the rear flange <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This is to restrain deformation of the hind end of the outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the circular plate portion <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed integrally with, at the front end of, the outer sheathing member <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, to restrain deformation in that area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A second bearing housing <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a tubular portion <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>disposed encompassing bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a circular plate portion <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>formed integrally with the tubular portion <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and fixedly coupled to the rear face of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The second bearing housing <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is press-formed integrally with a rear flange portion <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the skirt portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The tubular portion <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is situated in between an inner periphery of the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>; and reinforcing the inner periphery, the bobbin trunk <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is unlikely to compressively deform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> (c) In the foregoing embodiments, the first bearing housing is not reinforced, but the first bearing housing may be reinforced with a tubular part made of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the bearing housing is reinforced by making it at least partially from a metal whose strength is higher than that of the synthetic resin. Therefore, the bearing housing is not liable to get compressed. Even should compressive force have an effect on the bobbin trunk, taking out and replacing the spool bearing will be easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The terms of degree such as &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;, &ldquo;about&rdquo; and &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; as used herein mean a reasonable amount of deviation of the modified term such that the end result is not significantly changed. These terms should be construed as including a deviation of at least &plusmn;5% of the modified term if this deviation would not negate the meaning of the word it modifies. </paragraph>
