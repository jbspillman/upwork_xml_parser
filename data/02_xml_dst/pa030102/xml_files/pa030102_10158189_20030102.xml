<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the priority of German Application No. 101 26 469.0-35, filed May 31, 2001, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a slot antenna element in the form of a rectangular waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Slot antenna elements, frequently used as antennas in high-frequency engineering applications, comprise a waveguide which extends in a longitudinal direction and has at least one slot for the emission of a portion of an electromagnetic wave guided in the waveguide. In the area of the slot, a pin consisting of a conductive material is often provided as a device for exciting the emission of the waveguide wave from the slot. Such a slot antenna is known, for example, from German patent document DE-GM 1 959 159. In the equivalent circuit diagram, this slot antenna represents a first cross-connected capacitance C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, from German patent document DE 33 10 531 A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, slot antenna elements are also known, in which case the waveguide is frequently provided with a ridge extending on the inside at the wall opposite the slot in the longitudinal direction of the waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the special case of a symmetrically constructed rectangular ridge waveguide (in which a slot extending in the longitudinal direction of the waveguide as well as a ridge are arranged in the center with respect to the cross dimension of the waveguide), the above-mentioned pin made of a conductive material is a necessary means for exciting the emission of the waveguide wave from the slot. The operating principle consists of an asymmetrical distortion of the field distribution in the waveguide under the slot. In the equivalent circuit diagram, the slot-pin combination acts like a cross-connected capacitor in parallel to a series-resonant circuit. For the compensation, an inductive diaphragm can be used in the waveguide technique. However, its implementation is difficult in practice and furthermore itself causes a field distortion retroactive to the excitation of the emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an advantage of the invention to provide an improved slot antenna element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this advantage is achieved by providing a slot antenna element in the form of a rectangular waveguide. The slot antenna element includes at least one slot situated in the center of one broad side, a rectangular ridge arranged in the center of the interior surface of the other broad side. The slot and the ridge each extend along the longitudinal direction of the waveguide. Coupling devices, particularly in the form of pins, are arranged in the area of the slot, which excite the slot to emit electromagnetic energy, and compensation devices are constructed on the surface of the ridge facing the slot, which compensation devices compensate the mismatch of the waveguide caused by the coupling devices with respect to the generator feeding the waveguide with electromagnetic energy. The compensation devices are constructed such that the ridge has a step-shaped indentation in the area of the slot. Advantageous further developments of the slot antenna element according to the invention are the object of dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the slot antenna element in the form of a rectangular waveguide comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> a) at least one slot situated in the center of one broad side, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> b) a rectangular ridge arranged in the center of the interior surface of the other broad side, the slot and the ridge each extending along the longitudinal direction of the waveguide, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> c) coupling devices, particularly a pin, arranged in the area of the slot, which excite the slot to emit electromagnetic energy, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> d) compensation devices constructed on the surface of the ridge facing the slot, which compensation devices compensate the mismatch of the waveguide caused by the coupling devices with respect to the generator feeding the waveguide with electromagnetic energy, the compensation devices being constructed such that the ridge has a step-shaped indentation in the area of the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an equivalent line circuit, in which the slot of the waveguide is illustrated as a series-resonant circuit, the step-shaped indentation preferably represents a negative capacitance connected in parallel with respect to the series-resonant circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The negative and the positive capacitance can be explained by means of field theory. Thus, the coupling device in the area of the slot represents a positive capacitance. Field-theoretically, the effect of the coupling device can be explained as a field distortion, predominantly of the electric field of the line. This results in an increase of the field energy around the coupling device, for example, a pin. In an equivalent line circuit, this effect can be represented as a capacitance. Since the concentration of the electric field is increased, the capacitance is positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The ridge on the broad side of the waveguide opposite the slot can also be represented as a capacitance in an equivalent circuit. As a result of the step-shaped indentation of the ridge according to the invention, the ridge is reduced. This causes a lowering of the field energy. The capacitance therefore has a negative value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the devices for exciting the emission of the waveguide wave are formed by a pin made of a conductive material arranged laterally next to the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With respect to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide, the pin is preferably arranged at the level of the center of the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the step-shaped indentation has a rectangular cross-section of a length D and a height H parallel and/or perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the ridge. The length D and the height H of the step-shaped indentation are preferably selected such that C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;0 applies, wherein C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>indicates the coupling devices to be represented as the capacitance C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in an equivalent line circuit, and C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>indicates the step-shaped indentation in the ridge to be represented as a negative capacitance C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in an equivalent line circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The step-shaped indentation and the slot are preferably arranged with respect to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide in the center relative to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The breadth B of the ridge is advantageously larger than the breadth b of the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are cutouts of the slot antenna element in the form of a rectangular ridge waveguide with two broad sides <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and two narrow sides <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. On its one (first) broad side <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> extends in the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is used for emitting a portion of an electromagnetic wave guided in the waveguide. In the illustrated embodiment, the length of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> amounts to half the wavelength &lgr;/2 of the working frequency, that is, the resonant frequency of the slot antenna element. Opposite the first broad side <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the rectangular waveguide, another (second) broad side <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is situated, at whose interior side opposite the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided. The ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> also extends in the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the area of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, specifically viewed in the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in its center, a pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> made of an electrically conductive material is arranged. The pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> forms devices for exciting the emission of the waveguide wave out of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> causes an asymmetrical distortion of the field distribution in the waveguide in the area of the slot, whereby the waveguide wave is permitted to exit the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the emission. Without such devices for exciting the emission, a rectangular ridge waveguide of the illustrated type, in the case of which the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as well as the ridge extend in the waveguide center, would not emit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or, in a generalized manner, the devices for exciting the emission of the waveguide wave out of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, form a capacitance C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>which is connected in parallel to a series-resonant circuit LCR representing the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The capacitance C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>indicates a loading of this series-resonant circuit LCR with a capacitive reactance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is constructed on the ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the area of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For the wave propagating in the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, this step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> represents a second cross-connected capacitance C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which at least partially compensates the first cross-connected capacitance C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>represented by the pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Viewed from the side, the step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape of a length D and of a height H. Viewed transversely to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, whose breadth B corresponds to that of the ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, also has a rectangular cross-section. The length D and the height H of the step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are selected such that the capacitance C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the devices for exciting the emission from the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thus of the conductive pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the capacitance C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> just cancel each other out; thus, the equation C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;0 applies. The step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> therefore has a resulting negative capacitance which is precisely opposite the (positive) capacitance of the devices, that is, of the pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for exciting the emission from the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which forms the devices for the emission from the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is arranged in the center of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with respect to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Viewed transversely to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a rectangular cross-section, the breadth (width) B of the ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and thus also that of the step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, being larger than the breadth (width) b of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> arranged laterally next to the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is situated with its center approximately above the lateral boundary of the ridge <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. With respect to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the step-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged in the center at the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The resulting effect of the combined arrangement of the pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> forming the devices for the emission of the waveguide wave and of the step shape formed by the indentation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> consists of an excitation of the emission of the waveguide wave out of the slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without loading the circuit with a capacitive reactance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The foregoing disclosure has been set forth merely to illustrate the invention and is not intended to be limiting. Since modifications of the disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to persons skilled in the art, the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
