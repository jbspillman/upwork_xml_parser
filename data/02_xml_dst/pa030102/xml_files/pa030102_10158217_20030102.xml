With this, the forming technique of the microscopic wiring and securing of its reliability have become important objects. As one of means for attaining these objects, an embedded wiring method which forms wiring by embedding a metal in trenches or connection holes formed in a semiconductor wafer (hereinafter, simply referred to as a &ldquo;wafer&rdquo;) has come to the force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a unit which can carry out such an embedded wiring method, a plating unit which embeds a metal by electrolytic plating in trenches or connection holes formed in a wafer is known. In this plating unit, the metal is embedded in the trenches or the connections holes of the wafer by applying a voltage between a pair of electrodes while the wafer is in contact with a plating solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the plating unit as described above, when the metal is embedded in the trenches or the connection holes of the wafer, an additive contained in the plating solution is consumed with the elapse of time to lower an embedding speed. This reduction in the embedding speed causes decrease in throughput. Therefore, the plating solution, after used for a certain period, is replaced by a new plating solution to suppress the decrease in throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There exists, however, such a problem that the plating solution has to be replaced frequently since the embedding speed starts to lower in a short time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A plating system according to the present invention will be explained below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view schematically showing the structure of a plating system according to an embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic vertical sectional view of a plating unit according to the embodiment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic plan view of the inside of the plating unit according to the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plating system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a plating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to plate a wafer W and a plating solution storage tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which stores a plating solution used in the plating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the plating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be explained. The plating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is covered with a housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of a synthetic resin. Inside the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which holds a wafer W and a plating solution tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which stores the plating solution are mainly provided. In this embodiment, the driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed directly above the plating solution tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> near an upper part of the plating solution tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a separator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having therein an exhaust port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which sucks an evaporated plating solution or a scattered plating solution and a cleaning nozzle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which cleans the plating applied onto the wafer W is disposed. A through hole is provided in the center of this separator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to enable the driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move between a transfer position (I) and a plating position (IV) which will be explained later. Furthermore, a gate valve <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which allows the wafer W to be carried into/out of the plating unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided near the later-explained transfer position (I) in the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The plating solution tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is, for example, a dual tank consisting of an inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A to be filled with the plating solution and an outer tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B to which the plating solution overflowing from the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A flows. The inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape with its upper surface open and its bottom surface closed. A blowout pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which blows out the plating solution protrudes from a bottom part of the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> On the circumference of the blowout pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, an anode electrode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in a substantially disc shape is disposed coaxially with the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A. The anode electrode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a not-shown external power supply which is provided outside the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Note that a voltage is applied between the anode electrode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a later-described cathode electrode <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in order to plate a surface to be plated of the wafer W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> dividing the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A into an upper region and a lower region is provided between an end portion of the blowout pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A above the anode electrode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is structured to pass ions therethrough but not to pass therethrough impurities which are produced at the time the anode electrode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is dissolved and bubbles, for example, oxygen and hydrogen which are produced during the plating. Here, the upper region of the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and the lower region of the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A which are separated by the diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be hereinafter referred to as a cathode region and an anode region respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Openings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed in the bottom part of the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and later described pipes <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>A are connected to the openings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The outer tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape with its upper surface open and its bottom surface closed, similarly to the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A. An opening <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> through which the plating solution overflowing from the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A flows into a later-described cathode-side storage region is formed in the bottom part of the outer tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which holds the wafer W and a motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which rotates the wafer W together with the holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on a substantially horizontal level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A holder raising/lowering mechanism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which raises/lowers the holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to the plating solution tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is attached to the motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, the holder raising/lowering mechanism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in this embodiment raises/lowers the entire driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The holder raising/lowering mechanism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is composed of, for example, a support beam <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which is attached to the motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and which supports the driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a guide rail <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> attached to an inner wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a vertically expansible/contractible cylinder <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which raises/lowers the support beam <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> along the guide rail <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. By driving the cylinder <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the driver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supported by the support beam <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is raised/lowered along the guide rail <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Concretely, the holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> ascends/descends to move to the transfer position (I) where the wafer W is to be carried in/out, a cleaning position (II) where the plating applied onto the wafer W is to be cleaned, a spin-dry position (III) where spin dry to remove excessive plating solution and moisture from the plated wafer W is to be performed, and a plating position (IV) where the surface to be plated of the wafer W is to be plated. The wafer W held by the holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located in the transfer position (I) and the cleaning position (II) is above the level of the plating solution when the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A is filled with the plating solution. The wafer W held by the holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located in the spin-dry position (III) and the plating position (IV) is under the level of the plating solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. One wafer W is accommodated in an inner space of the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a substantially horizontal state. An opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> through which the wafer W is to be carried into/out of the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed in a sidewall of the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A shutter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which opens/closes freely is provided near the opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The shutter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is closed after the wafer W is carried in so that the opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is covered, thereby preventing the plating solution from entering the inner space of the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A circular opening <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which enables the surface to be plated of the wafer W to be in contact with the plating solution is formed in a bottom surface of the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Here, the wafer W according to this embodiment is held by the holder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by a so-called facedown method, with its surface to be plated facing downward. The wafer W has on its surface to be plated a thin film made of the same substance as the plating, namely, a so-called seed layer, which is formed by a film forming unit disposed in a different system, for example, a PVD unit. By forming the seed layer on the wafer W, a voltage applied to the later-described cathode electrode <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is also applied to the surface to be plated of the wafer W. Furthermore, trenches to form wiring therein and connection holes to serve for interlayer connection are formed on the surface to be plated of the wafer W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A ring-shaped seal member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is elastically deformed is provided on an inner bottom surface of the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A later-described pressing member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> presses the wafer W against the seal member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so that the seal member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed, thereby preventing the plating solution from entering the holder container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The cathode electrode <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to supply electricity to the surface to be plated of the wafer W is provided on the seal member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The cathode electrode <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a not-shown external power supply. On the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, formed are hemisphere-shaped contacts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at positions of, for example, 128 equal parts into which the circumference is divided, being in contact with an outer circumferential part of the surface to be plated of the wafer W.

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a view schematically showing the structure of the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. Note that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided in the middle of the pipe <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>A. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> whose upper surface and bottom surface are open. An opening <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> allowing the plating solution from which the dissolved oxygen is removed to flow out therethrough to an external region is formed in a side surface of the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The pipe <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>A is connected to a peripheral portion of the opening <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Covers <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> which cover an upper part and a bottom part of the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> are provided on an outer side of the upper part and an outer side of the bottom part of the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> respectively. A not-shown vacuum pump is connected to the covers <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The operation of this vacuum pump causes the pressure inside the covers <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to be lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Seal members <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> which seal an inner space of the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> are provided on an inner side of the upper part and the inner side of the bottom part of the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> respectively. Furthermore, a plating solution supply pipe <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> which supplies the plating solution into the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is inserted into the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. One end of the plating solution supply pipe <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is connected to the pipe <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>A and the other end thereof is buried in the seal member <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. A plurality of openings <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> which allows the plating solution to flow out therethrough are formed in a portion, which is positioned inside the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, of the plating solution supply pipe <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A plurality of hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> having a hydrophobic property and gas permeability are provided in a vertical direction inside the cylindrical container <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Concretely, the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> are arranged in a circle to surround the plating solution supply pipe <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> form a plurality of circles and they surround the plating solution supply pipe <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> in multiple circles. The hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> pass through the seal members <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> so that both of end portions of the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> are exposed in the covers <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Since both of the end portions of the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> are exposed in the covers <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the pressure inside the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is reduced when the aforesaid vacuum pump is operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In order to remove the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution by the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the aforesaid vacuum pump is operated to reduce the pressure in the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. This causes the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution flowing from the openings <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to be sucked into the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> so that the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution is removed. Incidentally, the plating solution usually contains the dissolved oxygen of about 10 mg/L, which can be reduced to about 2 mg/L or lower by the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Processes carried out in the plating system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be explained below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a view schematically showing the inside of the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while the plating solution according to this embodiment is supplied, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the flow of processes carried out in the plating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> First, the valve <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is opened so that the inert gas is supplied into the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from the inert gas storage cylinder <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is filled with the inert gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, the pumps <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>B are operated so that the plating solution is supplied to each of the anode-side region and the cathode-side region and at the same time it is stirred. Furthermore, the aforesaid vacuum pump is operated so that the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution flowing out of the openings <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is removed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Incidentally, the dissolved oxygen sucked into the hollow fiber membranes <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is discharged out of the dissolved oxygen removing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the covers <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, while this state is maintained, the wafer W is plated according to the flow shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> (STEP <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to STEP <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the dissolved oxygen is removed from the plating solution so that the reduction in embedding speed is suppressed to decrease the frequency of replacing the plating solution. In other words, consumption of the additives contained in the plating solution is considered to be one of the causes for lowering the embedding speed as is previously stated. To be concrete, it is considered to be one of the causes that the accelerator contained in the plating solution is oxidized due to the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution and it loses the function as the accelerator. In this embodiment, the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution is removed so that the oxidization of the accelerator contained in the plating solution is suppressed. Therefore, the reduction in the embedding speed is suppressed to lengthen the life of the plating solution. This decreases the frequency of replacing the plating solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the removal of the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution is especially effective in the case where the plating solution is caused to overflow from the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A as in this embodiment. The reason is that, in the case where the plating solution is caused to overflow from the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A, the amount of the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution is increased since the area of the plating solution in contact with the air becomes large at the time the plating solution overflows from the inner tank <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is filled with the inert gas so that the amount of the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution is decreased compared with a case when the plating solution in the plating solution storage tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is in contact with the air. Specifically, by filling the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the inert gas, the amount of the air in contact with the plating solution is reduced. This reduces the amount of oxygen taken into the plating solution in the plating solution storage tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the amount of the dissolved oxygen contained in the plating solution is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the described content of the above embodiment, and the structure, material, disposition of each of the members, and so on are allowed be changed appropriately without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
