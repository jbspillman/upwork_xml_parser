<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electronic component such as an antenna switch module, a coupler, a diplexer, a duplexer, a filter, or the like, for use in a mobile communication apparatus, such as portable telephones or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, mobile communication devices such as a portable telephone and a simplified portable telephone (a so-called PHS) have been made remarkably light and compact. The need for compact electronic components for use in mobile communication apparatus has correspondingly increased. For example, one of the electronic components used in such mobile communication apparatus is an antenna switch module for switching an antenna between signal transmission and signal reception modes (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-127663). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To attach the antenna switch module to a print substrate, surface mounting of the module was conventionally performed using solder (a solder fillet) provided between an external terminal of the module and a pad portion of the print substrate. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in an antenna switch module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponding to that disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-127663, an external terminal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is formed on a side face and a bottom face of the component, and terminal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and an unillustrated conductor of a print substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are joined to each other by a solder fillet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and surface mounting is thus performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, as the electronic component itself is made more compact, the area of the external terminal provided on the electronic component, i.e., the area of a portion used in the joining operation, is correspondingly reduced. Therefore, it eventually becomes impossible to obtain sufficient strength in the joint between the solder (corresponding to solder fillet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) and the external terminal of the electronic part. More particularly, when the print substrate mounting the antenna switch module thereto is dropped or otherwise impacted, a problem can arise in that the antenna switch module may, in some cases, fall off from, or become otherwise detached from, the print substrate because of the impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when the antenna switch module comprising first (lower) and second (upper) insulator substrates is mounted to the print substrate, a clearance <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is formed between the solder fillet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the second insulator substrate since no solder fillet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is joined to the second insulator substrate. Therefore, when an external force is applied to the antenna switch module, such as an impact which results from dropping the device, the resultant stress is concentrated in a laminating layer interface between the first and second insulator substrates so that a crack can be formed in the laminating layer body. Therefore, as a result, there is also the possibility that a circuit within the laminating layer body can become short-circuited or disconnected. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide an electronic component for use in a mobile communication apparatus which affords improved strength in the joint between the component and a print substrate such as a printed circuit board, while another object is to provide a mobile communication apparatus using such an electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an electronic component is provided which comprises at least first and second insulator substrates laminated one on another in a laminating direction; an external terminal provided on an edge face of the first insulator substrate and extending in the laminating direction, and an auxiliary electrode provided in at least one portion of a laminating face on a side of the second insulator substrate in a part of said laminating face which does not overlap the corresponding laminating face of the first insulator substrate. It is noted that the phrase laminating face as used above does not mean only a contact portion between the laminated first and second insulator substrates, but can rather mean the entire surface of the second (first) insulator substrate side of the first (second) insulator substrate. Accordingly, the area of the contact portion available for solder joining (e.g., soldering) is increased so that the joining strength of the electronic component is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The insulator substrate of the present invention is also referred to herein as an insulating layer. Further, the electronic component of the present invention is preferably a mounting type electronic component adapted to be mounted to a print substrate or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the electronic component of the present invention includes a concave recess formed on the side face of the first insulator substrate, and the external terminal is formed in the concave recess. With this arrangement, it is not necessary to provide extra space for accommodating the auxiliary electrode on the second insulator substrate. Therefore, there is no increase in size of the second insulator substrate or consequently, of the entire electronic component, and the strength of the joint made to the print substrate can be improved. Further, it is not necessary to reduce the first insulator substrate in size so as to provide extra space for accommodating the auxiliary electrode on the second insulator substrate. As a result, it is not necessary, from the point of view of ensuring proper attachment to the print substrate, to change the existing wiring conductor pattern on the print substrate to correspond with the change in the size of the first insulator substrate. As a consequence, the time required by the design stage of manufacture can thus be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The electronic component of the invention is suitable for mounting on a print substrate by using solder. In the mounting process, a solder fillet is wetted and spreads to both the external terminal and the auxiliary electrode and is thereby joined to both the first and second insulator substrates. As a result, the joining strength of the joint to the print substrate is thus improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the auxiliary electrode and the external terminal are connected to each other on the surface of a laminating layer body formed from the first and second insulator substrates. In this way, an end face of the laminating layer face of the first insulator substrate is covered with the solder fillet. Accordingly, stress is not concentrated at the laminating layer interface between the first and second insulator substrates. This avoids the generation of cracks and any resulting short-circuiting in a circuit formed within the laminating layer body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the first and second insulator substrates are constructed by glass ceramic formed by a ceramic component and a glass component. Accordingly, a low resistance metal such as Cu, Ag, and the like can be used as materials for the capacitor, the inductor, the external terminal and the auxiliary electrode. Therefore, the electronic component has excellent high frequency characteristics. Further, since glass ceramic normally has a low &ldquo;burning&rdquo; temperature of, e.g., about 1000&deg; C. or less, the burning temperature required during the manufacturing process can be reduced in comparison with that required when using a ceramic formed by alumina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the auxiliary electrode is formed in only an edge end portion of the laminating layer face on the side of the second insulator substrate. Accordingly, it is possible to avoid unwanted connections to a circuit pattern (e.g., a capacitor and an inductor) formed within the laminating layer body, and also to reduce the parasitic inductance of the auxiliary electrode itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least one of (i) a capacitor electrode constituting a capacitor and (ii) an inductor electrode constituting an inductor is provided, and the capacitor electrode and said inductor electrode are formed within, or on the surfaces of, the first and second insulator substrates. As a result, the entire electronic component can be made compact, and, in particular, can be reduced in height in comparison with an electronic component in which the capacitor and the inductor are mounted as a chip part on the laminating layer body constituting the electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one advantageous embodiment, the electronic component includes: a diplexer comprising at least a capacitor and an inductor; a high frequency switch comprising at least a semiconductor element and an inductor; and a filter comprising at least a capacitor and an inductor; the semiconductor element of the high frequency switch being mounted on the second insulator substrate; and an inductor electrode constituting the inductor of said high frequency switch, an inductor electrode constituting the inductor of said diplexer and a capacitor electrode constituting the capacitor of said diplexer, and an inductor electrode constituting the inductor of said filter and a capacitor electrode constituting the capacitor of said filter being formed within, or on the surfaces of, said first and second insulator substrates. As a result, the electronic component itself can be made compact by arranging the capacitor and the inductor as internally layered elements and a diode constituting the semiconductor element can be mounted on the laminating layer body. Further, even when the diode is so mounted and the weight of the electronic component itself is consequently increased, the strength of the joint between the electronic component and the print substrate is improved because the area of a portion joined to the solder joint relative to the entire electronic component is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a mobile communication device is provided which includes the above described electronic component. In such a mobile communication device, since the electronic component having a joint to the print substrate of improved strength is used, the overall mechanical and electric reliability is improved, particularly with respect to its resistance to failure due to external shock such as caused by dropping of the mobile communication device or by other impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in, or apparent from, the detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof which follows.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It will be understood from the foregoing that all of the capacitors and the inductors of the diplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the filters <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the high frequency switches <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting the antenna switch module do not have to be internally layered in the laminating layer body. Similarly to the diodes, components such as a capacitor of large capacitance, an inductor of large inductance, and like components unsuitable for the internal layering in the laminating layer body, may be also mounted on, rather than within, the laminating layer body as chip parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The insulating layer (insulator substrate) is formed of glass ceramic preferably comprising borosilicate glass and alumina. On the other hand, the electrode pattern is preferably formed by plating an Ag alloy with Ni&mdash;Au. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The antenna switch module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted to the print substrate by using the transmitting terminals TX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, TX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the receiving terminals RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the antenna terminal ANT, the control terminals VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the external terminal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the ground terminal GND formed on the surface of the laminating layer body and an auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and attaching these elements to wiring or conductive connections in a predetermined position on the print substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> using solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show an embodiment in which the antenna switch module is attached to the print substrate. A solder fillet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is joined to the external terminal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> arranged in a first insulating layer (insulator substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), to the auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> arranged in a second insulating layer (insulator substrate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>), and to an unillustrated wiring connection (pad) of the print substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic exploded perspective view which is useful in explaining the nature of the external terminal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the electronic component of the present invention. The external terminal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed in a concave groove, or recess, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (castellation) on a side face of the insulating layer (insulator substrate) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a side face metallizing layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed in the castellation <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The side face metallizing layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is advantageously formed by plating an Ag alloy with Ni&mdash;Au. However, the side face metallizing layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not limited to the above material, but may be formed by any suitable known material. For example, the side face metallizing layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be also formed by plating a conductor surface constructed by Ag, Cu, a Cu alloy, or the like with Ni, Ni&mdash;P, Ni-boron or a Ni&mdash;Au alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed by a surface metallizing layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on a laminating layer face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the second insulating layer (insulator substrate) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, lying on a print substrate side in the antenna switch module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Similarly to the above side face metallizing layer, the surface metallizing layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be formed by a suitable known material, using a method such as screen printing, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is not necessary to form the auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on the entire laminating layer face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the second insulating layer (insulator substrate) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is preferably formed only at an edge portion of the second insulating layer (insulator substrate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>), where the second insulator substrate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> does not overlap, but instead overhangs, the first insulator substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the positions of the castellations <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, external terminals <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are formed along one side face of the insulating layer (insulator substrate) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and external terminals <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the same number are also formed along an opposed side face of the insulating layer (insulator substrate) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the joint made with the print substrate is strengthened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Each external terminal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the corresponding auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed on the laminating layer body surface in such a way that the terminals <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and electrodes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are continuously connected to each other. Thus, the solder forms a solder fillet such that the solder is wetted to and spreads across both the external terminal and the auxiliary electrode. No clearance is formed between the second insulating layer (insulator substrate) and the solder fillet. Further, an edge portion of the laminating layer face at the sides of the first insulating layer (insulator substrate) is also covered with the solder fillet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the auxiliary electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire part of laminating layer face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the side of the second insulator substrate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the non-overlapping portion of the first and second insulator substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The area of the non-overlapping portion of the first and second insulating layers (insulator substrates) at each external terminal is set to be 0.09 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In this embodiment, there are sixteen external terminals in total; these are the transmitting terminal TX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the GSM (900 MHz band) transmitting section, the transmitting terminal TX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the DCS (1.8 GHz band) transmitting section, the receiving terminal RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the GSM receiving section, the receiving terminal RX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the DCS receiving section, the antenna terminal ANT connected to the antenna, the control terminals VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the control section, and nine ground terminals GNDs connected to the reference electric potential of the wireless section. The area of the non-overlapping portion of both the insulating layers (insulator substrates) is thus set at 1.44 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in total. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The above surface metallizing layer is preferably formed in 60% or more of the area of the non-overlapping portion of the first and second insulating layers (insulator substrates) at each external terminal. In the case where this figure is 60% or less, the solder fillet is not sufficiently raised and no improvement in joint strength is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, the auxiliary electrode is preferably formed in 4% or more of the laminating layer face of the second insulating layer (insulator substrate). In the case where this figure is 4% or less, sufficient joining strength to the print substrate is not obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The first and second insulating layers (insulator substrates) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably constructed from glass ceramic (low temperature burning ceramic) materials. When these materials are used, the electronic component can be formed by simultaneous burning. Further, various kinds of ceramic materials such as alumina, aluminum nitride, mullite, and the like, a resin, or a composite material of ceramic and resin can be used as other materials for the first and second insulating layers (insulator substrates) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The first insulating layer (insulator substrate) and the second insulating layer (insulator substrate) need not necessarily be constructed from the same material, but may be constructed by combining the above materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an antenna switch module has been described as an example of the electronic component, but it will be understood that the electronic component is not limited to an antenna switch module. In this regard, the present invention can be applied to any electronic component which is to be mounted on a print substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Both an electronic component in accordance with the present invention, and an electronic component having no auxiliary electrode, were attached to a test jig and a dropping test (drop test) was performed so as to confirm the effect of the present invention. In the dropping test, the antenna switch module having the auxiliary electrode and the antenna switch module having no such auxiliary electrode were used as the electronic part, and both antenna switch modules were soldered to a jig (108&times;44&times;25 mm in size and 100 g in weight) for the dropping test. This jig for the dropping test was freely dropped onto an iron plate an arbitrary number of times from a height of 180 cm.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated from the foregoing that even when this jig was repeatedly dropped a relatively large number of times, the electronic component of the present invention did not fall off the jig as a result of the dropping test. However, the electronic component having no auxiliary electrode did fall off the jig as a result of the dropping test in one case (18 drops). Further, the laminating layer face portions of both electronic components were examined for cracks after the dropping test. As indicated above, a crack was seen to have been formed on the laminating face of the electronic component having no auxiliary electrode in one case (12 drops), but no such crack formation was seen in the electronic component of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Further, a three-point bending test was performed on an antenna switch module having the auxiliary electrode, acting as the electronic component of the present invention, and on a corresponding antenna switch module having no auxiliary electrode. A sample used in the three-point bending test was made by joining the antenna switch module to a print substrate (manufactured using glass epoxy resin (FR-4) having an outer shape size of 0.8 mm in thickness, 30 mm in length and 38 mm in width). This sample was supported by left-hand and right-hand support bars (4 mm&phgr; in diameter), and was pressed against a pressing bar (4 mm&phgr; in diameter) arranged above at an intermediate position between the support bars, and the pressure was read by a load cell. The distance between the two support bars was set to 28 mm, and the pressing bar was raised and lowered at a speed of 5 mm/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Five samples (sample 1) each formed by connecting the auxiliary electrodes to all external terminals, five samples (sample 2) each formed without connecting the auxillary electrodes and the external terminals, five samples (sample 3) each formed by connecting the auxiliary electrode to only one of the external electrodes, and five samples (sample 4) each having no auxiliary electrode were used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Table 2 shows a breaking load with respect to a flexing amount. In accordance with the results of this Table 2, the flexing amount is 0.80 mm and the breaking load is 55.1 N in average value in the sample 4 (conventional product). In contrast to this, in the sample 1 (the product according to the present invention), the flexing amount is 0.93 mm and the breaking load is 63.5 N in average values. Accordingly, in comparison with the conventional product, the flexing amount and the breaking load are improved by 16% and 15%, respectively. In the sample 2, the flexing amount is 0.84 mm and the breaking load is 58.3 N in average values. In the sample 3, the flexing amount is 0.89 mm and the breaking load is 60.4 N in average values. It has been found from these results that the mounting type electronic component of the present invention having the auxiliary electrode is strong in withstanding the bending load as compared with the conventional mounting type electronic component having no auxiliary electrode. Further, it has been also found preferable to provide the auxiliary electrode in all of the external terminals, so as to be connected thereto. </paragraph>
