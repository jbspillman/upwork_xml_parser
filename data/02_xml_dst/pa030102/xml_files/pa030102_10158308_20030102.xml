<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a disinfectant composition comprising a first component, as peracetic ion precursor, and a second component, as source of peroxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a method for disinfecting and/or sterilizing the water line of a dental unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Oxidating solutions and/or compositions are used in dental surgery as disinfectants for sanitizing and disinfecting dental units and instruments such as handpieces and burs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The biocidal compositions and/or solutions available on the market are used to disinfect external surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Prior art also teaches the use of an autoclaving method to sterilize surgical instruments and handpieces. Autoclaving is a very effective decontaminating method that will destroy bacterial colonies on instruments and/or parts of a dental unit that can be removed and placed in the autoclave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The sterilizing action of autoclaving is applied to both external and internal surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A dental unit is equipped with a set conduits leading to handpieces and supplying each handpiece with compressed air and water and/or mixtures of air and water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The dentist uses the handpiece to perform operations in a patient&apos;s mouth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A bur held and revolving in a handpiece is cooled by flowing water. The bur is fitted to the handpiece and is used to drill and cut. The bur is cooled by a flow of water and air to form a spray mixture of nebulized water and compressed air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The handpiece is thus used directly in the patient&apos;s mouth during dental treatment. As a result, bacterial contamination from the handpiece to the patient and from the patient to the handpiece is inevitable. For this reason, hygiene is a very strongly felt problem in dental surgeries. To avoid cross contamination between patients, dentists and dental hygienists must therefore adopt a series of precautions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Bacterial contamination may occur when the dentist or hygienist switches off the spray of water and air at the end of a particular operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this situation, when the flow of air and water stops, no water drips from the handpiece. This is because the minor residual pressure in the conduits tending to push the water out is counteracted by a slight pressure in the opposite direction activated to prevent the water from dripping out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A handpiece designed to operate in this way, although it does prevent water from dripping out, may allow germs and bacteria to be sucked into the handpiece itself from the patient&apos;s mouth, causing particles of tissue from the patient&apos;s mouth to be nebulized within the handpiece. As a result, any germs and viruses present in the patient&apos;s mouth may enter the water and compressed air supply conduit through the handpiece and from there may contaminate the entire water line of the dental unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an experiment to test this type of bacterial contamination, a perfectly sterilized handpiece on a dental unit was fitted with a sterile bur and supplied with sterile water from a standard container. The dental unit was used for several days, after which the water in the tank was tested for bacteriological contamination. The tests revealed traces of bacteria, indicating that micro-organisms had been transferred from the patients to the dental unit, and had contaminated all the internal conduits, the water line of the dental unit and the water tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This provided a clear indication that microbes and/or viruses will contaminate the handpiece and from there will spread to the conduits and container/tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The transfer of microbes and/or viruses from the handpiece to the entire water system is facilitated by the concentration gradients which promote the spreading of microbes within the line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The spreading of the microbial colonies is also facilitated by the movements of the fluids within the conduits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To overcome the problem of bacterial contamination in dental units, a variety of sanitizing protocols have been devised to introduce disinfectant in the water line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In practice, the inside of the water conduits comes into contact with a disinfectant so that all the bacteria that may have been transferred from a patient to the conduits is completely destroyed before treatment on the next patient begins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The removable parts of the dental unit, such as the handpieces, are sterilized in an autoclave, while the conduits forming the water line of the dental unit are disinfected according to the protocols described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At regular intervals, for example at the end of a day&apos;s work or during a break in work, a complete disinfecting treatment is performed on the dental unit. This essentially consists in flushing the water line with a highly sporicidal substance and then allowing the substance to stand in the conduits. The length of this type of treatment depends on the degree of decontamination required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The substance most frequently used for this type of operation is glutaraldehyde. The sporicidal solution is pumped through the conduits and after a set time, the pump is stopped and the sporicidal solution left to stand in the conduits for a defined time. Next, the solution containing the glutaraldehyde is drained out and the water line is flushed with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Using glutaraldehyde as disinfectant, it is possible to disinfect a surface by leaving the glutaraldehyde in contact with the surface for approximately five minutes before flushing it out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, high-level disinfection can be performed by leaving the glutaraldehyde in contact with a surface for twenty to thirty minutes before flushing it out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To reach the sporicidal level required to achieve sterility, a contact time of five hours is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> This type of treatment, that is, sterilization, is therefore performed only at the end of the day. That is because performing it during normal working hours means stopping the dental unit for an excessively lengthy period of time during which no patients can be treated on that dental unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Indeed, the disinfection and sterilization treatment described above cannot be carried out when the dental unit is occupied by a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Moreover, disinfection and sterilization cannot be carried out between one patient and the next either. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the disinfection and/or sterilization performed with glutaraldehyde, as described above, makes the water line of the dental unit perfectly hygienic, the water conduits are contaminated immediately as soon as work is resumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the contamination is not only due to the bacteria in the patient&apos;s mouth but also to the bacteriological burden in the mains water supply which contains micro-organisms of various kinds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The micro-organisms that inhabit the water from the mains colonize and thrive in the water line of the dental unit. The micro-organisms cling to the walls of the conduits, multiply and form a biofilm that soon becomes difficult to remove. In time, the micro-organisms contaminate the entire water line and, as they grow, the biofilm on the inside surfaces of the conduits become thicker and thicker. When the biofilm peels off the surface of the water conduit of the dental unit, the micro-organisms that have grown inside the dental unit are released into the water flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Tests on samples of water from the mains used for several days in a dental unit showed that the water harbored thriving bacteriological colonies of around 100,000 microbes/ml of water used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To sum up, we can say that the water line of a dental unit is subject to the following three different types of contamination: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 1. direct contamination from the patient to the dental unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 2. contamination from the water supply to the dental unit; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 3. contamination present in the compressed air used to drive the dental instruments and for the sprays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The technical problem underlying the present invention is the provision of a sterilizing composition and a method for disinfecting and/or sterilizing the inside surfaces of the water line of a dental unit and that overcomes the limits and disadvantages of prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The applicant has solved this technical problem by formulating a special composition comprising at least a first component as peracetic ion precursor, and a second component as source of peroxide or nascent oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention has for an aim to provide a sterilizing composition with a high biocidal action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Another aim of the invention is to provide a method for rapidly and effectively disinfecting and/or sterilizing the water line of a dental unit. </paragraph>
