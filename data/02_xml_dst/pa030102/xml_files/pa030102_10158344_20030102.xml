<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods for treating certain fibrotic diseases or other indications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Glucose and other sugars react with proteins by a non-enzymatic, post-translational modification process called non-enzymatic glycosylation. At least a portion of the resulting sugar-derived adducts, called advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), mature to a molecular species that is very reactive, and can readily bind to amino groups on adjacent proteins, resulting in the formation of AGE cross-links between proteins. Recently a number of classes of compounds have been identified whose members inhibit the formation of the cross-links, or in some cases break the cross-links. These compounds include, for example, the thiazolium compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,703. As AGEs, and particularly the resulting cross-links, are linked to several degradations in body function linked with diabetes or age, these compounds have been used, with success, in animal models for such indications. These indications include loss of elasticity in blood vasculature, loss of kidney function and retinopathy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Now, as part of studies on these compounds, it has been identified that these compounds inhibit the formation of bioactive agents, such as growth factors and inflammatory mediators, that are associated with a number of indications. These agents include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TGF&lsqb;beta&rsqb;. As a result, a number of new indications have been identified for treatment with agents that inhibit the formation of, or more preferably break, AGE-mediated cross-links. It is not unreasonable to infer that the effects seen are due to the removal of AGE-related molecules that provide a stimulus for the production or release of these growth factors. Removal of such molecules is believed to proceed in part due to the elimination of AGE-related cross-links that lock the AGE-modified proteins in place. Moreover, such compounds also reduce the expression of collagen in conditions associated with excess collagen production. Regardless of the mechanism, now provided are new methods of treating a number of indications. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Arteriosclerosis is a disease marked by thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity in arterial walls, of which atherosclerosis is a sub-type. Arteriosclerosis in turn falls within the genus of stiff vessel diseases. Without limitation to theory, it is believed that damage to the blood vessels of these diseases is due to AGE-caused damage, either through protein cross-linking or the stimulation of bioactive agents, or both. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate stiff vessel disease, including arteriosclerosis and athersclerosis. Peripheral vascular disease is an indication that overlaps with atherosclerosis but also covers disease which is believed to have a stronger inflammatory component. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate peripheral vascular disease. Coronary heart disease is a form of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate coronary heart disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When the heart pumps blood into the vascular system, the ability of the arteries to expand helps to push blood through the body. When arteries become stiff, as they do in the natural process of aging, the ability of the arteries to expand is diminished and also has consequences for the heart. The heart has to work harder to pump the blood into the stiff arteries, and eventually hypertrophies (enlarges in size) to accomplish this. A hypertrophied heart is an inefficient pump, and is one of the disorders that leads to congestive heart failure. One compound believed to work by a mechanism shared by the compounds of the invention, 3-&lsqb;2-phenyl-2-oxoethyl&rsqb;-4,5-dimethyl-thiazolium salt, showed an ability to reverse the stiffness of arteries in a Phase IIa clinical trial, as measured by the ratio of stroke volume (ml) to pulse pressure (mm Hg). The potential clinical benefit of this is to lessen the effort that the heart must expend to push blood throughout the body. The effect is also believed to contribute to preventing hypertrophy and subsequent inefficiency of the heart, which inefficiency would contribute to congestive heart failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Stroke is a cardiovascular disease that occurs when blood vessels supplying blood (oxygen and nutrients) to the brain burst or are obstructed by a blood clot or other particle. Nerve cells in the affected area of the brain die within minutes of oxygen deprivation and loss of nerve cell function is followed by loss of corresponding bodily function. Of the four main types of stroke, two are caused by blood clots or other particles. The former two are the most common forms of stroke, accounting for about 70-80 percent of all strokes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Blood clots usually form in arteries damaged by atherosclerosis. When plaque tears from the sheer forces of blood flowing over an uneven, rigid cap atop the plaque site, thrombotic processes become involved at the &ldquo;injury&rdquo; site. As a result, clots can form. First agents are used to prevent, reduce or ameliorate the risk of stroke in patients who have suffered previous strokes or have otherwise been identified as at risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> First agents can also be used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate peripheral vascular disease and periarticular rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Treatment with the first agents during the relatively immediate aftermath of a heart attack can be used to reduce the size of the myocardial infarct resulting from the heart attack. This treatment is preferably administered within six hours of the heart attack, more preferably, within three hours. While the dosages discussed below can be used with this indication, such as a dose of 0.01-4.0 mg/kg administered orally or 0.01-2.0 mg/kg administered intravenously, preferably within the time period outlined above. Preferred routes of administration include i.v. injection or i.v. drip. Thereafter, optional supplemental administrations can be made with the dosages described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Atherosclerosis is a disease that involves deposition of blood lipids in plaque in the arteries throughout the body. In coronary arteries, accumulation of plaque progressively leads to reduced coronary flow, with occlusion of the arteries causing focal death of cardiac tissue (myocardial infarction, heart attack). If the amount of tissue that dies is large enough, death ensures. In a Phase IIa trial, one compound believed to work by a mechanism shared by the compounds of the invention, 3-&lsqb;2-phenyl-2-oxoethyl&rsqb;-4,5-dimethyl-thiazolium salt, increased the amount of circulating triglycerides (lipids). Consistent with the known presence of AGEs in plaque, the result indicates that the agent had a lipid mobilizing effect on arterial plaque. Reducing local deposits of plaque should eventually lessen the risk of myocardial infarction and death due to heart attacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Fibrotic diseases further include diseases that have as a manifestation fibrotic hypertrophy of the heart. These diseases include endomyocardial fibrosis (wherein endocardium and subendocardium are fibrosed, such as in some manifestations of restrictive cardiomyopathy), dilated congestive cardiomyopathy (a disorder of myocardial function with heart failure in which ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction predominate), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (characterized by marked ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction in the absence of an afterload demand), and other cardio-hypertrophies. In dilated congestive cardiomyopathy, typically at presentation there is chronic myocardial fibrosis with diffuse loss of myocytes. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, usually the interventricular septum is hypertrophied more than the left ventricular posterior wall (asymmetric septal hypertrophy). Treatment using the invention is expected to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate such diseases, or hypertrophy, fibrotic hypertrophy or fibrosis in such diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Hypertrophies of the heart can be diagnosed and monitored by methods known in the art, such as by electrocardiogram, echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Such diagnostic methods can be applied in particular for subjects having a risk factor for such hypertrophy, such as congestive heart failure, prior cardiac surgery or diabetes. In one aspect, the invention comprises identifying cardio-hypertrophy with using biophysical diagnostic tools, and administering an active agent of the invention to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate such diseases, or hypertrophy, fibrotic hypertrophy or fibrosis in such diseases. The invention can further include monitoring cardio-hypertrophy during the course of treatment with active agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Erosion or tearing of arterial wall plaque can occur due to the rough and irregular shape of the plaque as it forms from deposition of lipids and invasion of cells such as monocytes and macrophages (foam cells). When erosion occurs platelets and other components of the blood clotting system are activated, resulting in formation of a clot (thrombus). When the thrombus grows to such as state that blood flow is reduced, severe angina attacks that characterize unstable angina can occur. Plaque forms irregular shapes and in doing so creates shear stresses from the flow of blood over this irregular form. It is the irregularity of plaque shape that leads to the dislodging or tearing of the plaque, and to the subsequent invasion of reactive cells. On the surface of plaque is collagen, which is believed to contribute to the rigidity of the irregular shape. Without limitation to theory, it is believed that reducing the crosslinking of such a rigid collagen cap results in smoother blood flow, with a reduced risk of angina-causing tears. Accordingly, first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate unstable angina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Faithful conduction of the electrical impulse from the sinoatrial to the atrioventricular nodes depends upon close apposition of myocardial cells. Excess production of collagen in the heart, which occurs naturally with aging but more so in diabetes and in conditions of heart disorders such as hypertension, causes an increase in the distance between myocardial cells, leading to atrial fibrillation. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate atrial fibrillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The fibrotic indications further include restenosis, which is the process of increasing artery closure following an operation to open the artery, such as balloon angioplasty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Bladder Elasticity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Indications that can be treated, prevented, reduced or ameliorated with the first agents include loss of bladder elasticity. Bladder elasticity is tied to the frequency of urination, and the urgency of desire to urinate. Accordingly, the invention can be used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate non-obstructive uropathy, a disorder characterized by an overactive bladder that entails increased frequency of urination, a strong and sudden desire to urinate (urgency) which may also be associated with involuntary urinary leakage (urge incontinence). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Macular Degeneration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The effect of the first agents in reducing levels of other endogenous bioactive agents, particularly VEGF and/or TGF&lsqb;beta&rsqb;, is believed to underlie effectiveness against macular degeneration or macular edema. Again, however, the invention is not limited to theory. Moreover, a anti-fibrotic effect or another effect against tissue hypertrophy may contribute. Treatment using the invention is expected to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate macular degeneration. In one aspect of the invention, the treatment is used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate the wet form of macular degeneration or macular edema. In the wet form, new blood vessel growth has a greater contribution to the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> ALS is associated with degradations of the motor neuron system and/or the posterior column of the spinal cord. In ALS patients, these structures tend to stain with AGE-reactive antibodies. Treatment using the invention is expected to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate ALS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Bone Resorption </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is believed, without limitation to such theory, that reducing AGE accumulation at the joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis reduces stimulation of the production of cytokines involved in inflammatory processes of the disease. Treatment using the invention is expected to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Similarly, it is believed that reducing AGE accumulation at bone reduces stimulation of bone resorption. Accordingly, the invention is used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate osteorporosis, bone loss or brittle bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Dialysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The first agents can be administered as part of a dialysis exchange fluid, thereby preventing, limiting or ameliorating the damage to tissue caused by the sugars found in such exchange fluid. For example, first agents are expected to prevent, limit or ameliorate the stiffening and sclerosing of peritoneal tissue that occurs in peritoneal dialysis, as well as prevent, limit or ameliorate the formation of new blood vessels in the peritoneal membrane. In hemodialysis, first agents are expected to prevent, limit or ameliorate the stiffening and sclerosing of red blood cells and vasculature resulting from exposure to the sugars exchanged into the blood during dialysis. Exchange fluids for peritoneal dialysis typically contain 10-45 g/L of reducing sugar, typically 25 g/L, which causes the formation of AGEs and consequent stiffening and degradation of peritoneal tissue. Similarly, hemodialysis fluids typically contain up to about 2.7 g/L of reducing sugar, typically 1 to 1.8 g/L. Thus, the invention provides methods by which the first agents are provided in these fluids and thereby prevent, limit or ameliorate the damage that would otherwise result. Alternatively, the invention provides methods whereby the first agents are administered by the methods described below to prevent, limit or ameliorate such damage from dialysis. In hemodialysis, the exchange fluid preferably contains 0.006-2.3 mg/L of an agent of the invention, more preferably, 0.06 to 1.0 mg/L. In peritoneal dialysis, the exchange fluid preferably contains 0.01 to 24 mg/L of an agent of the invention, or preferably, 1.0 to 10 mg/L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, preventing or ameliorating is effected with a second agent. A preferred route of administration is inclusion in the dialysis fluids. In hemodialysis, the exchange fluid preferably contains 0.125 to 2.5 mg/L of aminoguanidine, more preferably, 0.2 to 1.0 mg/L. In peritoneal dialysis, the exchange fluid preferably contains 1.25 to 25 mg/L of aminoguanidine, or preferably, 2.0 to 10 mg/L. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the first agents are initially administered, and subsequently second agents are used to moderate or limit damage thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Asthma </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is believed, without limitation to such theory, that the first agents or second agents act to prevent, reduce or ameliorate the small but significant thickening of the lung airways associated with asthma. Moreover, the agents are believed to reduce stimulation of the production of cytokines involved in inflammatory processes of the disease. Accordingly, the agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate asthma. In this embodiment, one preferred route of administration is pulmonary, such as via an aerosol, though peroral administration is also preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Carpal Tunnel Syndrome </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is believed, without limitation to such theory, that the first agents act to prevent, reduce or ameliorate fibrotic and cytokine-induced elements of carpal tunnel syndrome. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate carpal tunnel syndrome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Fibrotic diseases also include Dupuytren&apos;s contracture, a contracture of the palmar fascia often causing the ring and little fingers to bend into the palm. Treatment using the invention is expected to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate Dupuytren&apos;s contracture, or hypertrophy, fibrotic hypertrophy or fibrosis in Dupuytren&apos;s contracture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In these embodiments, one preferred route of administration is local injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Periodontal Disease </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The incidence of periodontal disease is higher in subjects with either insulin-deficient or insulin-resistant diabetes, with consequent hyperglycemia. Again, without limitation to such theory, it is believed that the first agents act to prevent, reduce or ameliorate AGE-induced cytokine action to create or exacerbate periodontal disease. Accordingly, the first or second agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate periodontal disease. In this embodiment, one preferred primary or supplemental route of administration is via mouthwash, or compositions adapted for delivery into the subgingival periodontal pocket (such as implants and erodible microspheres). Peroral administration is again useful. The mouthwash preferably contains 0.003-1.0 mg/L of a first agent, more preferably, 0.01-0.1 mg/L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Sickle Cell Anemia </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is believed, without limitation to such theory, that the first agents act to prevent, reduce or ameliorate the restraint on blood flow caused by sickling. Again without limitation to theory, the mode of action is believed to be in reducing vascular as well as blood cell inelasticity. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate a sickle cell anemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Erectile Dysfunction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Fibrotic diseases further include diseases that have as a manifestation fibrotic disease of the penis, including Peyronie&apos;s disease (fibrosis of the cavernous sheaths leading to contracture of the investing fascia of the corpora, resulting in a deviated and painful erection). Treatment using the invention is expected to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate such diseases, or hypertrophy, fibrotic hypertrophy or fibrosis in such diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Without limitation to theory, it is believed that the first agents act to prevent, reduce or ameliorate inelasticity of tissue of the penis and/or fibrosis of tissue of the penis, such as inelasticity or fibrosis of the cavernous sheaths leading to contracture of the investing fascia of the corpora. At least partial restoration of the resulting inelasticity is believed to facilitate engorgement of the corpora cavemosa with blood. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate erectile dysfunction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Limited Joint Mobility </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Limited Joint Mobility (LJM) is a disorder associated with diabetes and typically involves the joints of the hands. The fourth and fifth fingers are affected initially by limitation of motion. AGE glycation and crosslinking of tendons (collagen) in the joints is believed to contribute to the disease. It is believed, without limitation to theory, that the first agents act to prevent, reduce or ameliorate inelasticity, fibrous tissue or cytokine-induced inflammation associated with limited joint mobility. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate limited joint mobility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Antineoplastic Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The first agents inhibit the stimulated formation of bioactive agents, such as VEGF, associated with angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is critical for both normal development and the growth and metastasis of solid tumors. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate the growth of neoplasms by limiting the formation of blood vessels needed to sustain the neoplasms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> End Stage Renal Disease, Diabetic Nephropathy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Diabetic Nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that evolves early, typically before clinical diagnosis of diabetes is made. The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is the appearance of low but abnormal levels (&gt;30 mg/day or 20 &mgr;g/min) of albumin in the urine (microalbuminuria), followed by albuminuria (&gt;300 mg/24 h or &tilde;200 &mgr;g/min) that develops over a period of 10-15 years. In patients with type 1 diabetes, diabetic hypertension typically becomes manifest early on, by the time that patients develop microalbuminuria. Once overt nephropathy occurs, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls over several years resulting in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in 50% of type 1 diabetic individuals within 10 years and in&gt;75% of type 1 diabetics by 20 years of onset of overt nephropathy. Albuminuria (i.e., proteinuria) is a marker of greatly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Without limitation to theory, it is believed that damage to the glomeruli and blood vessels of the kidney is due to AGE-caused damage, either through protein crosslinking or the stimulation of bioactive agents, or both. Accordingly, the first agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate damage to kidney in patients at risk for ESRD. The first agents can also be used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate glomerulosclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Hypertension, Isolated Systolic Hypertension </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Cardiovascular risk correlates more closely with the systolic and the pulse pressure than with the diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, the cardiovascular risk profile of diabetic patients is strongly correlated to duration of diabetes, glycemic control and blood pressure. Structural matrix proteins contribute to the function of vessels and the heart, and changes in the physical behavior of cardiovascular walls are believed to be important determinants of circulatory function. In elderly individuals, the loss of compliance in the aorta leads to isolated systolic hypertension, which in turn expands the arterial wall and thereby diminishes the dynamic range of elasticity. Loss of compliance also results in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. In vivo studies in rodents, canines and in primates indicate potential utility of 3-&lsqb;2-phenyl-2-oxoethyl&rsqb;-4,5-dimethyl-thiazolium salt in substantially ameliorating vascular stiffening. For example, in a dog model for diabetes, lower end diastolic pressure and increased end diastolic volume, indicators of ventricular elasticity, returned to a value at about the mid-point between the disease impaired value and the value for control dogs. Treatment with 3-&lsqb;2-phenyl-2-oxoethyl&rsqb;-4,5-dimethyl-thiazolium salt lead to a reduction in the mass of collagen in cardiovascular tissues. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate that 3-&lsqb;2-phenyl-2-oxoethyl&rsqb;-4,5-dimethyl-thiazolium salt reduces the expression of both Type IV collagen and TGFbeta. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Compared with that of a non-diabetic, the diabetic artery is smaller as it is stiffer. As in isolated systolic hypertension in which vessels stiffen with age and lose the dynamic range of expansion under systole. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate hypertension, including isolated systolic hypertension and diabetic hypertension. Moreover, the same benefit is anticipated for the more rare hypertensive disorder, pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare blood vessel disorder of the lung in which the pressure in the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that leads from the heart to the lungs) rises above normal levels and may become life threatening. The similarity in development of elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary bed with the increase in systemic blood pressure in diabetic hypertension and in isolated systolic hypertension suggests similar mechanisms are involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In a young human, systolic pressure is typically 120 mm Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm Hg, resulting in a pulse pressure of 40 mm Hg. With age, in many individuals pulse pressure increases, largely due to the increase in systolic pressure that results from stiff vessel disease. In individuals with pulse pressure greater than 60 mm Hg there is an increased risk of death from cardiovascular morbidities. In a Phase IIa trial, one compound believed to work by a mechanism shared by the compounds of the invention, 3-&lsqb;2-phenyl-2-oxoethyl&rsqb;-4,5-dimethyl-thiazolium salt, reduced pulse pressure in elderly patients with pulse pressures greater than 60 mm Hg in a statistically significant manner. This decrease in pulse pressure was believed to be due primarily to the effect of the agent on lowering the systolic blood pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The agents of the invention are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate reduced vascular compliance, elevated pulse pressure, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, the agents are used to reduce pulse pressure, increase vascular compliance, or decrease the risk of death. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Heart Failure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a clinical syndrome that entails cardiac disease of the ventricle. Diastolic dysfunction is a subset of heart failure in which the left ventricle stiffens with age. The stiffening of the left ventricle that occurs in CHF and in diastolic dysfunction is believed to result from increased crosslinking of collagen fibers with age and/or fibrosis and related hypertrophy. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate heart failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Retinopathy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The effect of diabetes on the eye is called diabetic retinopathy and involves changes to the circulatory system of the retina. The earliest phase of the disease is known as background diabetic retinopathy wherein the arteries in the retina become weakened and leak, forming small, dot-like hemorrhages. These leaking vessels often lead to swelling or edema in the retina and decreased vision. The next stage is proliferative diabetic retinopathy, in which circulation problems cause areas of the retina to become oxygen-deprived or ischemic. New vessels develop as the circulatory system attempts to maintain adequate oxygen levels within the retina. Unfortunately, these new vessels hemorrhage easily. In the later phases of the disease, continued abnormal vessel growth and scar tissue may cause serious problems such as retinal detachment. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate diabetic retinopathy. The fisrt agents can be administered by the methods described below, including by topical administration to the eye. The agents can also be administered by intravitreal implant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Cataracts, Other Damage to Lens Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> AGE-mediated crosslinking and/or fibrotic processes are believed to contribute to cataract formation and formation of other damage to lens proteins. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate cataracts or other damage to lens proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Atzheimer&apos;s Disease </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Considerable evidence exists implicating AGEs that form in the neurofibrillary tangles (tau protein) and senile plaques (beta-amyloid peptide) in early neurotoxic processes of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Insoluble human tau protein is likely crosslinked. Glycation of insoluble tau from AD patients and experimentally AGE-modified tau generate oxygen free radicals, resulting in the activation of transcription via nuclear factor-kappa B, and resulting in an increase in amyloid beta-protein precursor and release of amyloid beta-peptides. Thus, A.G.E.-modified tau may function as an initiator in a positive feedback loop involving oxidative stress and cytokine gene expression. First agents are used to treat, prevent, reduce or ameliorate Alzheimer&apos;s disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Other Indications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For reasons analogous to those set forth above, the invention is believed to be useful in treating, preventing, reducing or ameliorating diabetes or its associated adverse sequelae, and peripheral neuropathy. The agents, especially in topical form, increase elasticity and/or reduce wrinkles in skin. The agents further increase red blood cell deformability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In cardiovascular therapies, first agents can be administered concurrently or in a combined formulation with one or more antioxidants. Examples of appropriate antioxidants are vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, glutathione, &bgr;-carotene, &agr;-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, selenium and zinc, which are administered in effective amounts as is known in the art. Thus, the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an agent of the invention in combination with an effective amount of an antioxidant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In treating heart failure, cardiomyopathy or heart attack, first agents can be administered concurrently or in a combined formulation with one or more angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcuim channel blockers, diuretics, digitalis or beta blockers. Examples of ACE inhibitors include Captopril, Enalapril, Enalaprilat, Quinapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril, which are administered in effective amounts as is known in the art.

Thus, the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an agent of the invention in combination with an effective amount of an ACE inhibitor, diuretic, digitalis, beta blocker, or combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For treating diabetes or complications thereof, the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an agent of the invention in combination with an effective amount of a thiazolidinedione or &ldquo;glitazone&rdquo; diabetes drug, such as Troglitazone, Rosiglitazone, and Pioglitazone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In treating atherosclerosis, first agents can be administered concurrently or in a combined formulation with one or more statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) or cholestyramine. Examples of statins include Mevastatin, Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin and Fluvastatin, which are administered in effective amounts as is known in the art.
