<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a switching regulator and its utilization in an amplifier, specifically an amplifier for audio signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various types of switching regulators are known, the circuits of which differ depending on whether they are intended to supply an output voltage with a supply voltage of the opposite sign, an output voltage between 0 and the supply voltage, or an output voltage above the supply voltage. All of these switching regulators have an LC element composed of an inductive element and a capacitive element, and at least one switch that, by alternately opening and closing, allows for the storage in the LC element of electrical energy supplied through the supply voltage terminal and for the output of the stored energy on another voltage level at the output terminal. The basic principles of such switching regulators are described in Tietze-Schenck, <highlight><italic>Halbleiterschaltungstechnik </italic></highlight>&lsqb;Semiconductor Switching Technology&rsqb; 11<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999, pages 979 et seq. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage of these known switching regulators is that they are usable only within a limited output voltage range. In order to construct a switching regulator which can supply output voltages above and below a given supply voltage, two of these known switching regulators must be provided in parallel&mdash;one of the type known as a step-up controller or step-up converter and one of the type known as a step-down controller or step-down converter&mdash;and operated alternately depending on the output voltage required. Not only does this approach require a high level of circuit complexity for the switching regulators themselves, but their control is complicated since different switches following different principles of interaction between switch duty cycle and generated output voltage must be controlled according to whether the output voltages to be supplied are above or below the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One goal of the invention is to provide a switching regulator which uses a simple control which does not require any case-by-case discrimination between output voltages above and below the supply voltage and generates output voltages in a range on both sides of the level of the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this goal is achieved by a switching regulator including a supply voltage terminal, a ground terminal, an inductive element in which a first terminal is connectable through a first switch to the supply voltage, a capacitive element in which a first terminal is connected to a second terminal of the inductive element and a second terminal to the ground terminal, and an output terminal for outputting an output voltage, which terminal is connected to the first terminal of the capacitive element, the switching regulator being characterized in that a second switch is arranged in parallel to the capacitive element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a first phase of switching regulator operation in which two switches are closed, this circuit enables a current to bypass the capacitive element and to be conducted from the supply voltage terminal through the inductive element directly to ground so as to store an energy proportional to the square of the instantaneous current in the inductive element in this element, while in a second phase of operation in which the switches are closed the circuit allows the energy stored in the inductive element to be smoothed and output through the capacitive element at the output terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferably, in a certain switching position of the switch a diode is arranged with reverse bias in terms of the supply voltage in parallel to the series circuit of the inductive and capacitive elements. This diode blocks as long as the switches are opened but becomes conductive for the current generated by the inductive element when the switches are closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The in-phase opening and closing of the two switches generates simply as a function of the common duty cycle of the two switches an output voltage which can assume values between 0 and a given limiting value which lies above the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the event an output voltage significantly above the supply voltage at high output power is required, there is the additional possibility of keeping the first switch continuously open, instead of the in-phase control of the two switches, and only opening and closing the second switch at a given duty cycle. In this type of control, the current flow from the supply voltage terminal to the inductive element is never interrupted so that on average a greater current is allowed to flow in the inductive element than during alternate operation of the two switches. This greater current corresponds to a greater amount of energy stored in the inductive element and thus a greater output power available at the output terminal at a given output voltage. Although this complicates the control circuitry, the complication is acceptable in view of the improved output power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the event an output voltage significantly below the supply voltage at high output power is required, there is the additional possibility of keeping the second switch continuously open, instead of the in-phase control of the two switches, and only opening and closing the first one at a given duty cycle. In this type of control, any drain of the current flowing through the inductive element via the second switch to ground is blocked and the entire current flow from the supply voltage terminal is forced through the load RLOAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A control circuit to drive the switches of the switching regulator is preferably contained in this switching regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the switching regulator also includes a fourth switch to interrupt the connection between the second terminal of the inductive element and the first terminal of the capacitive element, as well as a second diode which, with reverse bias with respect to the supply voltage, connects the first terminals of the inductive element and the capacitive element. As long as this fourth switch remains closed, the switching regulator supplies an output voltage with the sign of the supply voltage. However, if the fourth switch remains open, the alternate opening and closing of the first switch causes the switching regulator to operate as an inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A fifth switch is appropriately arranged in series with the second diode between the first terminals of the inductive element and the capacitive element. This switch is kept open during operation of the switching regulator to generate an output voltage with the sign of the supply voltage to prevent the output current supplied by the inductive element from flowing through the second diode instead of through the load R<highlight><subscript>LOAD</subscript></highlight>. During inverter operation, the fifth switch is open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A preferred application of the switching regulator according to the invention is an amplifier, specifically an amplifier for a low-frequency signal such as an audio signal in which the output voltage of the switching regulator is regulated as a function of the instantaneous value of the audio signal, and the output signal of the amplifier is derived from the output voltage of the switching regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This type of amplifier is appropriately provided with a comparator for comparing the output voltage of the switching regulator with a voltage specified as a function of the amplifier input signal. This type of comparator provides for the generation of an output voltage with a high degree of linearity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to suppress the residual ripple in the amplified signal normally contained in the output voltage of the switching regulator as a result of its switch-mode operation, a low-pass filter is appropriately located between the output terminal of the switching regulator and the output of the amplifier. The cutoff frequency of this filter is between the upper cutoff frequency of the signal to be amplified and the keying rate at which the switches are switched on and off.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram of a first simple embodiment of the switching regulator according to the invention. A first switch in the form of a field-effect transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is located between a supply voltage terminal IN and a first terminal of an inductor L. The switch is supplied by a control device (not shown) with a control voltage VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A first diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected both to the first terminal of inductor L and to a ground terminal GND oriented such that it blocks the supply current flowing through switch T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A second terminal of inductor L is connected through a second diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> oriented in the direction of flow to the first terminal of a capacitor C, the second terminal of which is also applied to ground terminal GND. A second switch T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> supplied by the control circuit with a control voltage VC<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is located between the second terminal of inductor L and the ground terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A load resistance R<highlight><subscript>LOAD </subscript></highlight>located between the output terminal OUT and the ground represents a load which is supplied by the switching regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The two field-effect transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are each switched on and off in phase by the control circuit by means of control voltages VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VC<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When both transistors are simultaneously conductive, a current flow builds up from the supply voltage terminal IN through transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, inductor L, and transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to ground. When both transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are simultaneously connected at high resistance, a quantity of energy 0.5&times;L&times;I<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is stored in inductor L, where L is the inductance of the inductor and I the current in the inductor at the instant of the high-resistance connection of the transistors. The result of this quantity of energy is that a non-negligible voltage is built up at the second terminal of inductor L which flows through diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then, smoothed, through capacitor C via load R<highlight><subscript>LOAD </subscript></highlight>to ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the limiting case in which the duty cycles of both transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> go to 0, the voltage at output terminal OUT may assume any values close to 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To illustrate the performance of the circuit in the limiting case in which both duty cycles go to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the case may be considered in which the duty cycle of transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is exactly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while that of transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is 1-&egr;, where &egr; is a low real number. In this case, the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> responds like a conventional step-up converter with a duty cycle of 1-&egr;, this converter supplying an output voltage which is significantly above the supply voltage. As is evident, simply by varying the duty cycles of transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which are the same with respect to each other but jointly variable by the control circuit, the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is able to generate output voltages in the range between 0 and an upper cutoff value determined by the intrinsic resistances of the circuit elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a modification of the switching regulator of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which has been augmented by a series of additional circuit components. Those components already present in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> have the same reference identification and will not be described again. Among the additional components are: a field-effect transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected in series with diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the first terminal of inductor L and ground, a field-effect transistor T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected in series with diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the second terminal of inductor L and the first terminal of capacitor C, and a series circuit comprising a field-effect transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a diode D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which connects the first terminal of inductor L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the first terminal of capacitor C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the characteristic over time of control voltages VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through VC<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are fed to transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a function of a given output voltage to be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a first operating mode of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, shown as column a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected at low resistance by control voltages VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, VC<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is at high resistance, and transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is operated in alternating mode. This pattern for controlling the transistors reflects operation of the switching regulator purely as a step-up converter which is able to supply voltages, depending on the duty cycle at which transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is switched, between the supply voltage VCC and an upper voltage limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the mode of column b, transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are operated on an alternating basis, while transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are at low resistance and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> blocks. This operating mode matches that described above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a third mode, shown as column c, transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in alternating mode, transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are at low resistance, and transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are at high resistance. This reflects operation of the circuit as a step-down converter which is able to supply output voltages between 0 and the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a fourth mode, column d of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in alternating mode, transistors T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are at low resistance, and transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are at high resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a simplified view of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in which all connections in this fourth mode containing a high-resistance transistor are omitted and the permanently low-resistance transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is replaced by a straight line. When transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is open in this circuit, a current is built up through inductor L which, upon closing of transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, results in a voltage drop to negative values at the first terminal of inductor L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This voltage drop is passed on through the now conductive diode D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to output terminal OUT. This means that in the mode of column d the circuit acts as an inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Depending on the control of the various transistors, the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is thus able to generate both positive as well as negative output voltages, the values of which can exceed that of the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> differentiates between three different operating modes for the switching regulator shown in columns a, b, c generating an output voltage of the same sign as the supply voltage. These modes are illustrated in the diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which shows combinations of duty cycles &THgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>,&THgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the two transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as straight-line sections A, B, C. When these three modes are used to generate an output voltage which increases continuously from zero, the duty cycle of the first switch is raised from 0 to a value &THgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in the mode of column a with second transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> closed, at which value the first limit of the output voltage below the output voltage is reached (straight-line section C), then the system changes to the mode of column b in which both switches T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are operated at a duty cycle which rises from an initial value &THgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, corresponding to the first limit, to a final value &THgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>which corresponds to a second limit for the voltage above the supply voltage (straight-line section B); finally, the system changes to the mode of column a in which first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> remains continuously open and the duty cycle of the second transistor is increased from an initial value &THgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to approximately 1 (straight-line section A). Alternatively, duty cycles &THgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &THgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>which differ from 0, 1 or identity are also permissible; in this way, a desired characteristic for the output voltage may be reproduced, for example, by following the continuous trajectory D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is suited for constructing an audio amplifier with which even high-impedance loudspeakers having a significant output power may be driven. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of this type of audio amplifier. It includes a digital signal processor (DSP) to which a supply voltage VCC and an audio signal AUDIO are fed. The audio signal may be digital from the outset, or digitized in an A/D converter (not shown) for processing in the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Based on each digital audio signal value, signal processor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calculates an output voltage for the switching regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the invention required to drive a loudspeaker <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and applies the corresponding control voltages VC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through VC<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the transistors of the controller. These control voltages or duty cycles for the transistors alternately operated in the different modes may be determined from tables stored in the control circuit which specify these parameters as a function of the required output voltage. Loudspeaker <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the output of switching regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coupled to the output terminal of switching regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to return a digitized value for the output voltage to digital signal processor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This processor compares the value provided by analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the previously calculated desired output value and, in the event of a deviation, corrects the duty cycle of the transistors operated alternately in the currently used mode a, b, c, or d. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is evident that the keying rate at which signal processor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls switching regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> must lie by a multiple factor above the upper cutoff frequency of the audio signal in order to ensure that the residual ripple at the output of the switching regulator attributable to the alternate switching of the transistors can be effectively suppressed by low-pass filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If the applied audio signal AUDIO is a digital signal, it is appropriate to select an operating frequency for analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is equal to the sampling frequency of the audio signal or a small multiple of it, for example, 44.1 kHz. To preclude distortions in the output signal of the amplifier caused by the time-discrete functioning of the switching regulator, the frequency of the sampling values must be larger by a multiple factor than the operating frequency of the switching regulator. This means that given an assumed pulse keying rate of 44.1 kHz and a ratio of frequencies on the order of 10, low-distortion amplification of the audio signals is possible in a frequency range up to approximately 4 kHz. </paragraph>
