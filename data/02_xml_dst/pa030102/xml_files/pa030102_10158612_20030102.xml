<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;skin barrier&rdquo; is widely used in the medical field to refer to any of a variety of sticky, pliant, moisture-absorbing, skinfriendly adhesive compositions commonly utilized in ostomy appliances and wound dressings. Most frequently, such a skin barrier composition constitutes a continuous adhesive phase with particles of one or more liquid-absorbing and swellable hydrocolloids dispersed throughout the adhesive and constituting a discontinuous phase. Such skin barriers are commonly used with ostomy appliances to seal the faceplates of such appliances against peristomal skin surfaces and thereby protect those surfaces from exposure to stomal effluent as well as to prevent leakage of such effluent from about the stoma-receiving openings of the pouches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The initial tack of a hydrocolloid skin barrier material, usually referred to as &ldquo;dry tack,&rdquo; is provided by the continuous adhesive phase but, because such a skin barrier material is occlusive or non-breathable, adherence to the skin would be disrupted by perspiration and by liquid stomal discharge if it were not for the dispersed hydrocolloids which absorb fluids and thereby maintain and possibly enhance adhesive attachment to the skin. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,492,943 and 4,551,490 and other references disclose that suitable water-absorbing and swellable hydrocolloid gums commonly include hydrocolloids such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, pectin, gelatin, guar gum, locust bean gum, gum karaya, and mixtures thereof. The elastomers used in the continuous phase commonly include polyisobutylenes with which additives such as butyl rubber may be blended. The references also disclose that the elastomeric phase may contain a styrene block copolymer component to help provide extensibility and recoverability from modular strains to the composition. In addition, such skin barrier compositions may include mineral oil, to increase stretchability and adhesiveness of the blend, and suitable tackifying agents and antioxidants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Skin barrier materials are not only used for ostomy care but also more generally for wound care. Such barrier materials may constitute the skin-contacting layers of relatively flat wafers or discs to be used as wound dressings or as the adhesive sealing rings for helping to secure ostomy pouches in place. Caulking rings and strips of relatively soft hydrocolloid materials such as karaya are commonly added to the skin barrier surfaces of planar faceplates to help ensure effective non-irritating seals directly about patients&apos; stomas. Hydrocolloid-containing pastes are often used for a similar purpose, although such pastes are sometimes objectionable because of the irritation produced by their volatile solvents (usually alcohol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;skin barrier&rdquo; may also include the class of pliant, skinfriendly, moisture-absorbent materials commonly referred to as hydrogels. Hydrogels are known that also have adhesive characteristics, and such adherent hydrogels are also believed suitable for use in fabricating the skin barrier strips of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention takes the form of an elongate rectilinear strip of skin barrier material that may be cut to desired length and formed, stretched and/or molded by a user into a generally circular shape or into some other shape that extends about and follows the outline of a wound or stoma. Alternatively, smaller portions of the strip may be torn or cut away and molded between the fingers for insertion into spaces between skin folds and other surface irregularities where fluid leakage might otherwise occur. In a preferred embodiment, the strip may be formed of a pliant skin barrier material that is non-flowable, so that when the strip is formed into a ring it may serve at least to a limited extent as a convex pressure ring about a stoma or wound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A characterizing feature is that the strip is of generally triangular cross section and, more specifically, has the cross section of a triangle with at least two, and preferably three, unequal sides. A user desiring to form such strip into a ring to be interposed between the skin and the surface of a wound dressing or ostomy faceplate therefore has the option of forming rings of at least two, and preferably three, different levels of projection depending on which of the strip&apos;s side surfaces is coplanar with, and sealed to, the barrier surface of the dressing or faceplate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> designates an elongate strip of skin barrier material. As shown most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the strip is of generally triangular cross section with at least two sides of the triangle being of unequal length. In the preferred embodiment shown, all three sides <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are of different lengths resulting in a scalene triangular shape. Each of the sides of the strip may be flat or planar, with such sides meeting along relatively sharp corners or edges, but in a preferred embodiment it is believed desireable that the corners be rounded as shown. Furthermore, while they as shown in the drawings to be flat or planar, one or more of such sides may be slightly concave or convex. For example, side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be concave, as represented by phantom line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or, alternatively, such side may be convex as indicated in the same figure by line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In some cases it may be desireable to make one or more of the sides with portions that are alternately concave and convex, when viewed in section, as indicated by phantom line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. All such variations should be relatively slight departures from true flatness so that the strip in any case is substantially triangular in cross section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed into a ring or closed loop and applied to the adhesive surface of a conventional ostomy wafer or faceplate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Such a faceplate has an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of conventional skin barrier material and a backing layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed of a flexible film or fabric, all as well known in the art. The faceplate also has an opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that may be shaped and sized to match a patient&apos;s stoma <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The ring or loop formed by strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also defines an opening of similar size and shape as that of the faceplate. One side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the ring is in direct adhesive contact with the adhesive surface of barrier layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> oriented in one of three possible positions to produce a selected extent of axial projection or protrusion. Where a greater extent of projection is desired, the strip may instead be oriented as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> with the shortest side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in adhesive contact with the generally planar barrier layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The extent of projection may thus be controlled by the user to meet the requirements for different patients depending, for example, on the extent of annular pressure that needs to be applied to cause a stoma, such as a recessed stoma, to extend into a collection pouch to which the faceplate is attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Most advantageously, the cross sectional shape is that of that of triangle that is both scalene and oblique, meaning that none of the corners is a right angle and all three sides are of unequal length. Analyzed in the same way, strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also has unequal sides <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;; however the corners were sharp, the cross sectional triangular shape is that of a right scalene triangle. Like the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> may be formed and positioned to produce closed loops or rings having any of three different levels of projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a third embodiment of the invention in which strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&Prime; is also of triangular cross sectional configuration but two of its sides <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&Prime; are of equal length, and are longer than the third side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime;, resulting in a cross sectional configuration that is generally that of an isosceles triangle. Since strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be formed and adjusted to produce closed loops of only two different levels of axial extension or projection, the third embodiment is somewhat less advantageous than the first or second embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The barrier material from which strips <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&Prime; are formed may be any of a variety of known skin barrier compositions. Depending on the selection of ingredients and their proportions, the properties of softness, tackiness, fluid absorbency, extensibility and recoverability, may be varied considerably for different applications. One skin barrier formulation that is believed to be particularly suitable is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,943 and is commercially available under the designation &ldquo;Flextend&rdquo; from Hollister Incorporated, Libertyville, Ill., but other skin barrier compositions having different properties, including adhesive hydrogels, may be selected. </paragraph>
