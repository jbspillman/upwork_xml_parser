<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF APPLICATION AND PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a circuit layout for several sensor elements of several touch switches, the sensor elements having an operating state that changes as a consequence of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such circuit layouts are known from the prior art, e.g. from EP 859 648. In the latter the sensor elements are permanently connected to the control means or the control signal is permanently applied. They are also permanently connected to the evaluating means, evaluation of the individual sensor elements taking place by means of a multiplexer. Thus, certain costs are involved with the said circuit layout, which prevent a more widespread use of touch switches. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PROBLEM AND SOLUTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The problem of the invention is to provide a circuit layout for several sensor elements, which is simplified from the circuitry standpoint or can be implemented with lower component costs and which ensures reliable operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This problem is solved by a circuit layout having the features of claim 1. Advantageous and preferred developments of the invention form the subject matter of the further claims and are described in greater detail hereinafter. By express reference the wording of the claims is made into part of the content of the description. In the context of this application the word comprise is not to be understood as limited to, but including. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention connecting means or connecting switching means are provided, with which a sensor element is connected or interconnected with the evaluating part for the evaluation of an operating state. This connection or interconnection can be selectable, so as in this way to bring about an adaptation to different circumstances, as well as the number of sensor elements. Particular preference is given to a sensor element connected to the evaluating part, so that the latter can be kept very simple. This avoids complicated components or a multiplexer, as described in EP 859 468. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The connecting means can be constituted by semiconductor components. In a particularly simple version they can be diodes. However, it is also advantageous to use switching means or controllable, particularly electronically controllable switches, for which transistors represent a good choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The connecting means are advantageously controlled by means of a signal, preferably a timed signal. A timing means can be designed in such a way that in each case only one sensor element is simultaneously connected across the connecting means to the evaluating part. According to a further development of the invention, for each sensor element a connecting switching means is provided, which enables a simplification of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a design possibility provided by the invention, the control signal can be permanently applied to the sensor elements or the latter can be connected to the control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another preferred design possibility, the sensor elements are connected by connecting means to the control signal. Preferably they are the same connecting means as are used for connecting to the evaluating part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An evaluating part of a circuit layout can be constructed in such a way that it has a capacitor and a transistor. The transistor collector can be connected across the capacitor to earth or ground. The emitter can be connected to the control signal. The transistor base can be connected across a diode and a resistor to a control signal. Advantageously an equilibrium between the base and emitter occurs during the operation of the circuit across the resistor and the diode when the sensor element connected to the evaluating part is not in operation. This should be a voltage equilibrium. Advantageously the evaluating part is connected to a controller for evaluating the signal, so that as a function thereof a switching process or a state change can be brought about. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On operating the sensor element, in the case of the aforementioned construction the equilibrium between the transistor base and the emitter can be modified. The transistor opens more strongly and the capacitor can be charged to a higher voltage value. In such a case the transistor advantageously operates as a resistor controllable across its base. This increased voltage value can be evaluated by means of a simple follow-up circuit, because the signal change can be selected relatively high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The sensor elements of the circuit layout can be contained in independent sensor branches. One sensor branch can in each case contain a control point and a mass or body contact. The control point can be connected to the control signal or control circuit and simultaneously the evaluating circuit. The connecting switching means are preferably contained in the sensor branch. In particular, there is also a control associated with the connecting switching means in each sensor branch or is separately provided for the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As a result of the simplified construction of the circuit according to the invention, it is possible to arrange the sensor elements further apart whilst simultaneously obtaining a very good signal travel and for this purpose no analog switch components are needed. In addition, the signal travel of the circuit can be made so large that it is possible to evaluate a signal of a sensor element without amplifiers. Several or many sensor elements can be operated with a minimum of components. By means of the connecting switching means a type of multiplexing can take place, but of a very simple and convincing nature from the circuitry standpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and further features can be gathered from the claims, description and drawings and the individual features, both singly and in the form of subcombinations, can be implemented in an embodiment of the invention and in other fields and can represent advantageous, independently protectable constructions for which protection is hereby claimed. The subdivision of the application into individual sections and the subheadings in no way limit the general validity of the statements made thereunder.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a circuit layout, which is designed in exemplified manner for the evaluation of three capacitive touch switches. In a simple modification, it is obviously possible to operate further touch switches. A control part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a signal source <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with a control signal. The control signal is preferably an alternating voltage signal or a unipolar square-wave signal. There are also a resistor R<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the control part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The evaluating part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a transistor T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, whose emitter E is connected to the signal source <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and whose base B is connected to the diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The collector C of T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed against the basic potential of the circuit or ground by means of a parallel connection of a capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a resistor R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By means of an output <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> it is possible to tap the output signal, which is applied as an analog signal to the capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The capacitor C<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constitutes a disturbance variable in the circuit and can be inserted in a circuit for a homogeneous output signal. Fundamentally such a disturbance variable should be avoided, but through component insertion the satisfactory function of the circuit can be ensured. An exemplified value for C<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is approximately 10 pF. A R disturbance variable or a RC disturbance variable are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The sensor part <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the circuit layout <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises several so-called sensor branches <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which have in each case a capacitive touch switch C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and are represented by a capacitor. It is possible to use as capacitive touch switches all possible types, particularly preference being given to those described in EP 98101516, whose content is hereby made by express reference into part of the content of the present patent application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The sensor branches <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> also have connecting switching means in the form of transistors T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>whose function is to connect the touch switches C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the control part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and evaluating part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The transistors T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are controlled via connecting switching signals <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and series resistors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The connecting switching signals <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are selected in such a way that at all times only one sensor branch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is at the control part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and evaluating part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FUNCTION OF THE CIRCUIT IN FIG. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The fundamental function of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will now be described. This description generally applies to the other circuits according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and any differences will in each case be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The signal source <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for control purposes supplies a control signal, which is applied to the emitter E of T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and via the diode branch to the base B of T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. By means of the connecting switching signals <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in an automatic, predetermined order individual sensor branches <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and therefore sensor elements C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected to the circuit. In exemplified manner, hereinafter the case is used as a basis where the sensor branch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is connected across the controlled transistor T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>If the touch switch C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not operated, across the diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> there is a synchronization between emitter E and base B of T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If the touch switch C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is now operated, this leads to a voltage or transit time change at base B compared with the emitter E of T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This leads to a greater opening of transistor T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the evaluating capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged to the higher voltage value. T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> acts as a variable resistor controlled across its base. The output signal can be taken from the capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the output <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It can be evaluated e.g. by a controller or the like. Such an evaluating method is described in the aforementioned European patent application. On opening transistor T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged. Across resistor R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be discharged again if the control signal of signal source <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Through the successive connection or coupling of in each case one sensor branch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the control or evaluating circuit, there is a type of timed polling of the individual sensor branches. This permits a very simple control of several sensor elements C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, whose switching state is polled successively or in timed manner by the connecting switching signals <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE OTHER CIRCUIT EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a slight modification of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the connecting switching means T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constructed as freely switchable transistors being replaced by connecting means in the form of diodes D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Through a corresponding choice of the connecting switching signals, in precisely the same way as for the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in each case one sensor branch <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be connected to the remaining circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The circuit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a further modification. The fundamental structure with control part <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, evaluating part <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and sensor branches <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> is also present here. For example, three sensor branches <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are shown, but there can be a random greater number. As a variant the resistor R<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is placed between the signal source <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and the base B of transistor T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The emitter E is connected across the diode D<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> to the control signal <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The sensor branches <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are constructed in substantially the same way as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but the diodes are oppositely connected. There is also a resistor R<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> parallel to the sensor branches <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. Said resistor R<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> functions as a leakage resistor and discharges the sensor elements C<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and renders the diodes D<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> conductive. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FUNCTION OF THE CIRCUIT LAYOUT IN FIG. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter the function of the circuit layout of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is described. This also applies to the further variants of said circuit in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The signal source <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> supplies an alternating voltage or unipolar square-wave signal, which is fed across resistor R<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to the base B of T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The control signal is applied to the emitter E of T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> across diode D<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. During the time where the control signal is higher than 0.7 V, in the case of an operated sensor element capacitor C<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, the latter is charged to the value (control signal-0.7 V). During this time the transistor T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is blocked, in order to separate the area of the evaluating part <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> with output <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and capacitor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At the time where the input voltage of the control signal <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> drops below the voltage at emitter E of T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the diode T<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is blocked, the transistor T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is opened and transfers the voltage at sensor element <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> to capacitor C<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> of the evaluating part. As described hereinbefore, as a result the analog output signal can be tapped at the output <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. An actuation can be read from this output signal. It must be borne in mind that via the connecting switching signals <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and the resistor R<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in each case precisely only one diode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can be made conductive and consequently said sensor branch <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> is connected to the remaining circuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS ACCORDING TO FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The circuit according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> corresponds to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. However, there is additionally a diode D<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> between the collector C of T<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the parallel branch of capacitor T<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. This diode avoids a leakage current between D<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> corresponds to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but here again the diodes D<highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are turned around. Resistor R<highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> can symbolize further disturbance variables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> corresponds to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, but here in exemplified manner the diode <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> essentially corresponds to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but the resistor R<highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>&prime; is inserted between the control signal source <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and diode D<highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>. There is no resistor corresponding to resistor R<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A further fundamental modification of the circuit according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> can consist of the diodes D<highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and resistors R<highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> being interchanged compared with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Thus, the diodes D<highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> are directly at the source of the connecting switching signals <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A further, not shown variant of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is designed in such a way that the diodes D<highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> are reversed. Therefore a diode D<highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> as the connecting means with a connecting switching signal <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> in the high time interval can connect the sensor element C<highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> to the remaining circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention or the above-described circuits are characterized by the following points: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The circuit is subdivided into the control part, evaluating part and signal branch part. The number of signal branches can be essentially chosen at random and a larger number can be selected, e.g. up to 20 signal branches or sensor elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Of the numerous sensor branches through a corresponding connecting switching signal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and corresponding connecting means T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in each case precisely one sensor branch is connected with a sensor element C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the control and evaluating means. Thus, a type of multiplexing can be brought about in a very simple manner. As a result of the shift of the voltage equilibrium at the transistor T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with a corresponding charging of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the evaluating part, an analog output signal can be obtained. This output signal can be evaluated without further amplification by a controller or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The possibility of varying the arrangement and design of the connecting switching means and the control thereof by connecting switching signals is rendered generally comprehensible and correspondingly implementable for the expert by the preceding description and the associated circuit examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is possible to replace the capacitive sensor element C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a corresponding, different sensor element, e.g. optically or ultrasonically based and to correspondingly adapt the same to the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A major advantage of such a circuit layout is that its components can be reduced, which leads to cost savings and ensures a reliable function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to an embodiment of the invention, a circuit layout for several sensor elements of touch switches can be created. It is subdivided into a control part with a control signal and a sensor part with several sensor branches, in each case containing a capacitive sensor element. An evaluating part inter alia has a capacitor, where an analog output signal can be tapped. By means of connecting means, e.g. in the form of diode transistors, with corresponding control means precisely one sensor branch is connected to the remaining circuit and the corresponding sensor element is controlled and evaluated. </paragraph>
