<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An active matrix type organic EL display apparatus according to the present invention which apparatus uses current writing type pixel circuits is provided with a current control circuit for each of data lines connected to the pixel circuits. The current control circuit supplies part of a data line current to a pixel circuit as a bypass current. The current control circuit handles the bypass current of the data line current represented by (data line current&equals;data current&plus;bypass current). Thereby, the data line driving current can be set greater than the data current flowing through TFTs provided in the pixel circuit, thus reducing luminance data writing time. Also, when the writing time is set unchanged, transistor size of the TFTs provided in the pixel circuit can be reduced. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an active matrix type display apparatus having an active device in each pixel and controlling display in the pixel unit by means of the active device, and a driving method thereof, and particularly to an active matrix type organic EL display apparatus using an organic-material electroluminescence (hereinafter described as organic EL (electroluminescence)) device as an electrooptic device, and a driving method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display using a liquid crystal cell as a display device of a pixel, for example, has a large number of pixels arranged in a matrix manner, and controls light intensity in each pixel according to information of an image to be displayed, thereby effecting driving for image display. The same display driving is effected by an organic EL display using a current-controlled type electrooptic device, for example an organic EL device as a display device of a pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The organic EL device has a structure formed by sandwiching an organic layer made of organic material including a light emitting layer between two electrodes. When a voltage is applied to the device, an electron is injected from the cathode into the organic layer and a hole is injected from the anode into the organic layer, and then the electron and the hole are recombined with each other to emit light. The organic EL device provides a brightness of a few 100 to a few 10000 cd/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>at a driving voltage of 10 V or lower, and is a self-luminous device. The organic EL device has advantages such as high image contrast and high response speed. Thus, an organic EL display using the organic EL device as a display device of a pixel is considered promising as a next-generation flat-panel display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As driving methods of the organic EL display, there are a passive matrix method and an active matrix method. The passive matrix method emits light only at a moment when a light emitting device of each pixel is selected. While the passive matrix method has a simple construction, the passive matrix method has problems such as difficulty in realizing a large high-definition display. On the other hand, the active matrix method can maintain light emission of the organic EL device in each pixel for a period of one frame, and therefore may be said to be a driving method suitable for increasing size, resolution, and brightness of the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In an active matrix type organic EL display, a polysilicon thin film transistor (TFT) is generally used as an active device in a pixel circuit for controlling brightness of each pixel. Controlling variations in characteristics of the thin film transistor and compensating for variations in the characteristics of the thin film transistor by circuit means are major problems of the active matrix type organic EL display using the thin film transistor in the pixel circuit. This is for reasons mentioned in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display using a liquid crystal cell as a display device of a pixel controls luminance data of each pixel by a voltage value. On the other hand, an organic EL display controls luminance data of each pixel by a current value. A configuration of a simplest active matrix type organic EL display using voltage writing type pixel circuits is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A circuit configuration of a voltage writing type pixel circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an active matrix type organic EL display has a large number of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> arranged in a matrix manner, and repeats writing luminance data by supplying the luminance data in a form of voltage from a voltage driving type data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through data lines <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>while selecting scanning lines <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>sequentially by a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. A pixel arrangement of m columns and n rows is shown in this case. Of course, in this case, the number of data lines is m and the number of scanning lines is n. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the voltage writing type pixel circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes: an organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> having a cathode connected to a first power supply (for example negative power supply); a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to an anode of the organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a source connected to a second power supply (for example ground); a capacitor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> connected between a gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the second power supply; and an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to the gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a source connected to the data line <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>), and a gate connected to the scanning line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the thus formed pixel circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the TFT <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> selects the pixel for writing the luminance data, and controls the capacitor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to retain the luminance data voltage. The capacitor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> retains the luminance data voltage supplied through the TFT <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> drives the organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> according to the luminance data voltage retained by the capacitor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this case, letting Le<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> be luminous brightness of the organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, Ie<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> be a current flowing through the organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, Vth be a threshold voltage of the TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, k be a constant of proportionality, and Vdata be the data voltage retained by the capacitor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, when the TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is used in a saturation region, the following equation holds:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Le</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prop;<highlight><italic>Ie</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>data&minus;<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>th)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> where k&equals;&frac12;&middot;&mgr;&middot;Cox&middot;W/L, wherein &mgr; is mobility of the TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>; Cox is gate capacitance per unit area; W is gate width; and L is gate length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the equation (1), the value of the current supplied to the organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, that is, the luminous brightness of the organic EL device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is affected by variations in the mobility &mgr; (&prop;k) of the TFT <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the threshold voltage Vth. In fact, it is known that amorphous silicon and polysilicon used to form the TFT have inferior crystallinity and inferior controllability of the conducting mechanism to single-crystal silicon, and thus the TFT has great variations in transistor characteristics. It is therefore difficult to fabricate a high-quality organic EL display having a number of gradation levels that makes it possible to display a natural picture by using the voltage writing type pixel circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As a method for solving the problem, the present applicant has proposed a current writing type pixel circuit to which luminance data is written in a form of current (see International Publication Number 01/06484). An example of configuration of the current writing type pixel circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the current writing type pixel circuit includes: an organic EL device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> having a cathode connected to a first power supply (for example negative power supply); a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to an anode of the organic EL device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and a source connected to a second power supply (for example ground); a capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> connected between a gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the second power supply; an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to a data line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and a gate connected to a first scanning line <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A; a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> having a drain and a gate connected to a source of the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and a source connected to the second power supply; and an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to the drain and gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, a source connected to the gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a gate connected to a second scanning line <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The TFTs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in the thus formed current writing type pixel circuit each function as an analog switch. The TFT <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> converts a luminance data current to be written into a voltage. The capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> retains a luminance data voltage obtained by the TFT <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> by converting the luminance data current into the voltage. The TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> converts the luminance data voltage retained by the capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> into a current and feeds the current obtained by the conversion to the organic EL device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The TFT <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> form a current mirror circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An active matrix type organic EL display shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is formed by arranging such current writing type pixel circuits in a matrix manner. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, first scanning lines <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A-n and second scanning lines <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B-n are both arranged one for each of rows of current writing type pixel circuits <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> corresponding in number with m columns&times;n rows and arranged in a matrix manner. In each pixel, the gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is connected to the first scanning line <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A-n and the gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is connected to the second scanning line <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B-n. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A first scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>A is provided on a left side of the pixel unit to drive the first scanning lines <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A-n, while a second scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>B is provided on a right side of the pixel unit to drive the second scanning lines <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B-n. Data lines <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>are arranged one for each of the columns of the pixel circuits <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. One end of each of the data lines <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>is connected to an output terminal for each column of a current driving type data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> writes the luminance data current to each of the pixels through the data lines <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A circuit configuration of a plurality of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 connected to an ith-column data line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>in the thus formed active matrix type organic EL display is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A driving timing relation between the pixel circuits is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When a luminance data current is written to a selected pixel circuit through the data line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, a first scanning line (represented by WS (Write Scan) in the figures) and a second scanning line (represented by ES (Erase Scan) in the figures) are selected to turn on the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the TFT <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In this case, the TFT <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> converts the luminance data current into a voltage. The capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> retains the voltage obtained by the conversion. The TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> converts the luminance data voltage retained by the capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> into a luminance data current and feeds the luminance data current to the organic EL device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to thereby drive the organic EL device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Le</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prop;<highlight><italic>Ie</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>W</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>W</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&middot;<highlight><italic>Iw</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the equation (2), the written data current Iw is in proportion to the current Ie<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> flowing through the organic EL device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. When there are no variations in transistor characteristics of the TFTs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> disposed in a local area within the pixel and forming the current mirror circuit, variations in the luminous brightness of the display are compensated for. Thus, by using the current writing type pixel circuits, it is possible to realize an organic EL display having a large number of display gradation levels, that is, a number of gradation levels that makes it possible to display a natural picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, when low luminance data is written to a pixel circuit in the active matrix type organic EL display using the current writing type pixel circuits as described above, impedance of the data line is increased, and therefore a writing time required to write the data current becomes longer. In practice, when size of one pixel is a few 100 &mgr;m&square; or less, a current flowing through an organic EL device of one pixel is at most a few 10 &mgr;A or less. For display of many gradation levels, for example 256 gradation levels, it is necessary to control a current of a few to a few 10 nA or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to shorten the data current writing time, it suffices to set a mirror ratio of the current mirror circuit to be (W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)&lt;(W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and increase the writing data current. However, increasing the writing current means that a great current needs to be passed through the TFTs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Then, size of the TFTs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> needs to be increased, which results in an increase in size of the pixel circuit. Thus, in an organic EL display using current writing type pixel circuits, shortening the data writing time and decreasing the size of the pixel circuits are in a trade-off relation with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Letting the number of scanning lines be Nscan and frame frequency be f, the data writing time Twrite is expressed by the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>write&equals;1/(<highlight><italic>f&middot;N</italic></highlight>scan)&emsp;&emsp;(3)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the equation (3), in order to increase the size and resolution of the organic EL display, it is necessary to shorten the data writing time Twrite and at the same time decrease the size of the pixel circuits. Thus, both shortening the data writing time and decreasing the size of the pixel circuits in a trade-off relation need to be satisfied at the same time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an active matrix type display apparatus, an active matrix type organic EL display apparatus, and driving methods thereof that make it possible to increase the display size and resolution by reducing the data writing time while preventing an increase in size of transistors in a pixel circuit when a current writing type pixel circuit is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided an active matrix type display apparatus comprising: a pixel unit formed by arranging pixel circuits in a matrix manner, the pixel circuits each having an electrooptic device; data line driving means for supplying luminance data to the pixel circuits as a data line current via data lines; and current control means (hereinafter described as a &ldquo;data line control circuit&rdquo; in embodiments) for driving the data line current supplied from the data line driving means as a data current for writing the luminance data to each of the pixel circuits and a remaining bypass current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The current control means, which is a characteristic part of the present invention, handles the bypass current of the data line current. It is thereby possible to substantially reduce time for writing the data current flowing through TFTs provided in the pixel circuit. In addition, when the writing time is set unchanged, transistor size of the TFTs provided in the pixel circuit can be reduced. An organic EL device having a first electrode, a second electrode, and an organic layer including a light emitting layer between the first electrode and the second electrode, for example, is used as the electrooptic device in the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, current writing type pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponding in number with m columns&times;n rows are arranged in a matrix manner.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>includes: an organic EL device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a cathode connected to a first power supply (for example negative power supply); a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to an anode of the organic EL device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a source connected to a second power supply (for example ground); a capacitor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected between a gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second power supply; an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to the data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, and a gate connected to a first scanning line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-k; a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> having a drain and a gate connected to a source of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a source connected to the second power supply; and a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to the drain and gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a source connected to the gate of the TFT <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a gate connected to a second scanning line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B-k. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the thus formed current writing type pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>each function as an analog switch. The TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> converts the luminance data current to be written into a voltage. The capacitor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> retains a luminance data voltage obtained by the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by converting the luminance data current into the voltage. The TFT <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> converts the luminance data voltage retained by the capacitor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> into a current and thereby drives the organic EL device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the TFT <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have substantially the same characteristics, thus forming a current mirror circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In this case, let W<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> be gate width of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> be gate length of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> be gate width of the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> be gate length of the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Also, let Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> be a current flowing through the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Since gate length is generally controlled by a device fabrication process, the following description assumes that gate length L does not change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A, a</cross-reference> data current control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes: an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> having a drain connected to the data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, and a gate connected to the current control scanning line <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>; and a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a drain and a gate connected to a source of the TFT <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and a source grounded. A ratio in size between the TFTs <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the data current control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set to be the same as a ratio in size between the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. In this case, let W<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> be gate width of the TFT <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> be gate length of the TFT <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> be gate width of the TFT <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and L<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> be gate length of the TFT <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Also, let Iw<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> be a current flowing through the TFTs <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram of circuit operation of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, a relation between a data line current (I data line) flowing through the data line, a bypass current (I bypass) flowing through the data line control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a data current (I data) flowing through the pixel circuit can be expressed by the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I </italic></highlight>data line&equals;<highlight><italic>I </italic></highlight>data&plus;<highlight><italic>I </italic></highlight>bypass (preferably <highlight><italic>I </italic></highlight>data&equals;&lE;<highlight><italic>I </italic></highlight>bypass)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The bypass current flowing through the data line control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the data current flowing through the pixel circuit are determined by input impedance of the data line control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the pixel circuit, respectively. (A current determined by the input impedance of the data line control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is defined as the bypass current.) Thus, by using the bypass current as part of the data line current, it is possible to set the data line current greater than the data current flowing through the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and thereby reduce luminance data writing time. In addition, when the writing time is set unchanged, transistor size of the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> provided in the pixel circuit can be reduced and set arbitrarily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a driving timing relation between the ith-column pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2.

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Supposing that luminance data is written to the pixel circuit in the kth row, the first scanning line WSk and the second scanning line ESk are both selected. The current control scanning line LS is selected at all times. Supposing that the data line current for driving the data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>is Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and that a ratio R between the data current Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> flowing in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>and the remaining current Iw<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> flowing in the data current control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is R&equals;Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Iw<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the following relational equation holds:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thus, assuming that the data current Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the same current value as the current Iw<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is passed through the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>, the gate widths W<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>can be reduced to &frac12; (half) of the gate widths W<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight> of the TFTs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in the conventional circuit. In other words, when the size of the transistors in the pixel circuit is set to be the same as in the conventional circuit, the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> for driving the data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>can be substantially increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the active matrix type organic EL display apparatus using the current writing type pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the data current control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided for each of the data lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>, and part of the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> for driving the data lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>is supplied to the pixel circuit for writing luminance data and the remaining current of the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is passed through the data current control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is thereby possible to set the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> greater than the data current Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> flowing through the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while preventing an increase in the size of the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. It is thereby possible to reduce the data writing time substantially and thus increase the size and resolution of the organic EL display apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In order to compensate for variations in the characteristics of the transistors, however, the TFTs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the writing side forming the current mirror circuit are required to have the same transistor characteristics as the TFT <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the driving side. In other words, when the data current control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> including the TFT <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is disposed at a position distant from the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, variations in the transistor characteristics are not fully compensated for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are divided into certain areas in a column direction to thereby combine pluralities of the pixel circuits into blocks, that is, combine pluralities of the pixel circuits connected to the same data line into blocks, and the data current control circuits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided for example one for each of the blocks in the single data line, it is possible to fully compensate for variations in the transistor characteristics.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> An active matrix type display apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention will next be described. The active matrix type display apparatus according to the second embodiment uses a circuit configuration obtained by omitting the data current control circuits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the active matrix type display apparatus according to the first embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that is, the same configuration as the active matrix type display apparatus according to the conventional example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, the active matrix type display apparatus according to the second embodiment realizes the same function as that of the active matrix type display apparatus according to the first embodiment by using a pixel circuit to which no writing is being performed as a data current control circuit (bypass current). A driving method of the active matrix type display apparatus according to the second embodiment will be specifically described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A circuit configuration of a plurality of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 connected to an ith-column data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>in the active matrix type display apparatus according to the second embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Each of the pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 has a configuration of the current writing type pixel circuit having four transistors (TFTs), which is the same as the pixel circuit according to the first embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> show driving timing relations between the plurality of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In both examples of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, x</cross-reference> (x&equals;2 in the examples) pixel circuits continuous in a column direction are selected simultaneously. When the two pixel circuits are thus selected simultaneously, part of a data line current for driving the data line is written as a luminance data current to one of the pixel circuits. In this case, although the luminance data current is not written to part of the other of the pixel circuits, the pixel circuit is used as a bypass current circuit (data current control circuit) to which the remainder of the data line current is fed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in particular, when x (x&equals;2 in the example) pixel circuits continuous in the column direction are grouped as one block and a data current is written to one of the pixel circuits in the block, the data current is not written to the other pixel circuits in the same block, but the other pixel circuits are used as bypass current circuits. In this case, a first scanning line WS and a second scanning line ES of the pixel circuit to which the data current is written are both selected. Supposing that the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is the pixel circuit to which the data current is written, for example, WSk&minus;1 and ESk&minus;1 are both selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the pixel circuit to which the data current is not written but which is used as the bypass current circuit, only the first scanning line WS is selected. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> first scanning line WSk is selected and a second scanning line ESk is not selected. Thus, TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> function as a data current control circuit (bypass current circuit) used for bypass current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Specifically, since the second scanning line ESk of the pixel circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is not selected and thus a TFT <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is in an off state, a charge corresponding to luminance data and retained by a capacitor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is not discharged through the TFT <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but remains retained. In this case, only part of the circuit, or the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> function as the data current control circuit (bypass current circuit). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Gate width of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is W<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; gate length of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; gate width of the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is W<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; gate length of the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; and the data current flowing through the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thus, assuming that the data current having the same current value as the bypass current is written to the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>, the gate widths W<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>can be reduced to 1/x of the gate widths W<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight> of the TFTs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in the conventional circuit. In other words, when the size of the transistors in the pixel circuit is set to be the same as in the conventional circuit, the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be substantially increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the active matrix type organic EL display apparatus using the current writing type pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, two pixel circuits adjacent to each other in the column direction are selected simultaneously, and part of the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is supplied to the pixel circuit for writing luminance data and the remaining current is fed as a bypass current to part of the other pixel circuit. It is thereby possible to set the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> greater than the data current Iw<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> flowing through the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while preventing an increase in the size of the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. It is thereby possible to reduce the data writing time substantially and thus increase the size and resolution of the organic EL display apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that while in writing the data current, the second embodiment simultaneously selects two (x&equals;2) pixel circuits adjacent to each other in the column direction, the present invention is not limited to two pixel circuits, and more pixel circuits can be selected simultaneously. By increasing the number of pixel circuits to be selected and thus increasing the number of pixel circuits used as a data current path, it is possible to further reduce the size of the transistors in the pixel circuit, or further increase the current value of the data line current Iw<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. However, from a trade-off relation, since a distance between the transistors forming the current mirror circuit is increased, effect of compensation for variations in transistor characteristics is correspondingly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while in the second embodiment, the pixel circuit to which luminance data is not written but which is selected as a pixel circuit used as a bypass current circuit is a pixel circuit adjacent in the column direction to the pixel circuit for writing the luminance data, the pixel circuit is not necessarily limited to the adjacent one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even when two pixel circuits adjacent to each other in the column direction are selected simultaneously as in the second embodiment, characteristics of the transistors forming the current mirror circuit may be varied and thus present a problem. It is generally known that in a case where thin film transistors are used as the transistors in the pixel circuits, when N-type transistor characteristics become stronger, P-type transistor characteristics become weaker, or when P-type transistor characteristics become stronger, N-type transistor characteristics become weaker; thus variations in characteristics of a P-channel and an N-channel transistor are in an opposite direction from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Hence, by using field-effect transistors of opposite conduction types as the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for a scanning switch and the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for current-to-voltage conversion, for example an N-channel field-effect transistor as the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a P-channel field-effect transistor as the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, variations in characteristics of the transistors cancel each other out, whereby variation in potential of the data line can be controlled. For the above reason, it is desirable to use field-effect transistors of opposite conduction types as the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> While the second embodiment has been described above by taking as an example an active matrix type display apparatus provided with current writing type pixel circuits of a four-transistor configuration, the current writing type pixel circuits are not limited to pixel circuits of the four-transistor configuration. Pixel circuits of other than the four-transistor configuration will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing an example of configuration other than the four-transistor configuration of current writing type pixel circuits. The pixel circuits according to the present example are configured such that a scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are shared between two pixels adjacent to each other, for example, in each column. Specifically, as for a first scanning line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, scanning lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>Ak&minus;1, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>Ak&plus;1, . . . are arranged one for every two pixels. In the case of a k&minus;1 and a k pixel, for example, a gate of the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to the scanning line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>Ak&minus;1, and a source of the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected with a drain and gate of the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and drains of TFTs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the two pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a driving timing relation when the pixel configuration in which the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are shared between two pixels is used. Fundamental operation in this case is the same as in the foregoing example. In this case, the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be shared between two pixels because the TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is used only at a moment of writing a data current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> By using such a pixel configuration in which the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are shared between two pixels adjacent to each other, for example, it is possible to omit two transistors in every two pixels. The number of transistors in two pixels is six, and therefore the number of transistors per pixel is three. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A current flowing through a data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>is much greater than a current flowing through an organic EL device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, large transistors are used as the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that directly deal with the great current, thus inevitably resulting in a large area being occupied by the transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, by using the pixel configuration in which the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are shared between two pixels as in the pixel circuits according to the present example, it is possible to greatly reduce the area of the pixel circuits occupied by the TFTs and thus it is possible to extend a stacking arrangement of light emitting units or reduce pixel size to thereby increase resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While the present example is a circuit example in which the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are shared between two pixels, it is obvious that the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be shared between three pixels or more. In this case, effect of reducing the number of transistors is further increased. In addition, instead of sharing both the scanning TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the current-to-voltage conversion TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, it is possible to share only one of the TFTs between a plurality of pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Third Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a configuration of an active matrix type display apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As with the active matrix type display apparatus according to the second embodiment, the active matrix type display apparatus according to the third embodiment is configured so as to share a first scanning line WS between x pixel circuits in the same block when x pixel circuits continuous in the column direction are formed into one block and selected simultaneously, and a data current is written to one of the pixel circuits and the other pixel circuits are used as bypass current circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As described above regarding the active matrix type display apparatus according to the second embodiment, when two pixel circuits in the same block are selected simultaneously, scanning lines WS of the driven circuits operate in the same manner, and therefore the scanning line WS can be shared in the same block. In the present example, where x&equals;2, a scanning line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shared between a first-row and a second-row pixel circuit, . . . , and a scanning line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-n&minus;1, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-n is shared between an (n&minus;1)th-row and an nth-row pixel circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A circuit configuration of a plurality of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 connected to an ith-column data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>in the active matrix type display apparatus according to the third embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Each of the pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 has the same configuration as the pixel circuit according to the first embodiment, that is, the configuration of the current writing type pixel circuit having four transistors (TFTS) <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows driving timing of the plurality of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the active matrix type organic EL display apparatus in which x pixel circuits continuous in the column direction are formed into one block and selected simultaneously, and in which part of a data line current is written as a data current to the pixel circuit for writing luminance data and the other pixel circuits are used as bypass current circuits, the first scanning line WS is shared between the x pixel circuits in the same block. It is thereby possible to reduce the number of first scanning lines WS to 1/x. Thus, in addition to the effects obtained by the second embodiment, it is possible to reduce display size in the column direction (vertical direction) by an amount corresponding to the reduction in the number of scanning lines WS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> While in the third embodiment, the x pixel circuits continuous in the column direction are formed into one block, the pixel circuits do not necessarily need to be continuous in the column direction; discrete x pixel circuits may be formed into a block. Also in this case, although wire routing is required in each of the pixel circuits, the first scanning line WS can be shared between the x pixel circuits in the same block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Fourth Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> An active matrix type display apparatus according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention will next be described. A configuration of the active matrix type display apparatus according to the fourth embodiment is substantially the same as that of the active matrix type display apparatus according to the third embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A circuit configuration of a plurality of pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 connected to an ith-column data line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>in the active matrix type display apparatus according to the fourth embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. The pixel circuits <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&minus;</italic></highlight>1 to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>k&plus;</italic></highlight>2 according to the present example use, as an analog switch, a CMOS transistor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed by connecting an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B in parallel with each other in place of the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Potential of a first scanning line WSk&minus;1, k is supplied directly to a gate of the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, and is inverted by an inverter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and then supplied to a gate of the P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Usually, a pixel circuit uses a unipolar switch as an analog switch because of a limitation in area or the like. On the other hand, as described as effects of the second embodiment, for example, by simultaneously selecting two pixels adjacent to each other in the column direction, and writing a data current to one of the pixels and not writing the data current to the other pixel circuit but using the other pixel circuit as a bypass current circuit, it is possible to set a writing data current greater than the current flowing through the transistors of the pixel while preventing an increase in the size of the transistors. In other words, when the current value of the writing data current is set unchanged, it is possible to reduce the transistor area of the pixel. Thus, the CMOS transistor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be used as an analog switch of the pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> When a low current is passed through the TFTs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the pixel circuit according to the third embodiment, a source potential of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is increased and a gate-to-source potential of the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is decreased, so that the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may not be fully turned on. On the other hand, in the pixel circuit according to the fourth embodiment, an analog switch is formed by using the CMOS transistor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when a low current is passed through the CMOS transistor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a TFT <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B is fully turned on even if the TFT <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A is not fully turned on, so that the CMOS transistor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be fully turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the foregoing embodiments have been described by taking as an example a case where an organic EL device is used as a display device of a pixel, and a polysilicon thin film transistor is used as an active device of the pixel so that the present invention is applied to active matrix type organic EL display apparatus obtained by forming the organic EL device on a substrate where the polysilicon thin film transistor is formed; however, the present invention is not limited to the application to the active matrix type organic EL display apparatus, and the present invention is applicable to active matrix type display apparatus in general that use, as a display device of a pixel, a so-called current-controlled type electrooptic device that changes brightness thereof according to a current flowing therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As described above, the active matrix type display apparatus or active matrix type organic EL display apparatus according to the present invention supply part of a data line current for driving a data line as a bypass current. It is thereby possible to set the data line driving current greater than a data current flowing through TFTs provided in a pixel circuit, and thus substantially reduce luminance data writing time. In addition, when the writing time is set unchanged, transistor size of the TFTs provided in the pixel circuit can be reduced. It is thus possible to increase the size and resolution of the display. </paragraph>
