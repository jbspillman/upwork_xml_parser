<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device and an electronic apparatus. The present invention particularly relates to a transflective reflective liquid crystal display device which can perform display with sufficient brightness in transparent mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A reflective liquid crystal display device does not have a light source such as a back light and consumes less electricity. Thus, a reflective liquid crystal display device is mainly used in an auxiliary displaying section for various mobile electronic apparatus and device conventionally. However, in the reflective liquid crystal display device displays by using an external light such as available light and light supplied from a lighting device, there was a problem in understanding what is displayed in a dark environment. From that point of view, a liquid crystal display device in which external light is used like an ordinary reflective liquid crystal display device in a light place, and display is visible in darkness by using an internal light source, is proposed. This kind of liquid crystal display device employs a displaying method compatible with a reflective method and a transparent method, and bright display operation and reduction of energy consumption can be realized by changing the display mode between reflective mode and transparent mode according to the circumstance even if the liquid crystal display is used in a dark condition. Hereinafter in this specification, this kind of liquid crystal display device is called a &ldquo;transflective reflective liquid crystal display device&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For a transflective reflective liquid crystal display device, a liquid crystal display device provided with a reflective layer made of a metal foil such as aluminum on which light transmitting slits are formed on a surface of a lower substrate is proposed. In such a liquid crystal display device, an influence of parallax due to the thickness of the lower substrate is prevented by forming the metal foil on an inner surface of the lower substrate. Particularly in the case in which a color filter is used, occurrence of color mixing is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross section partially showing an example of a transflective reflective liquid crystal display device employing a passive matrix method. In a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, liquid crystals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are disposed between a pair of substrates such as an upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Reflective layers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are layered on the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a stripe form of scanning electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> made of transparent conductive layer such as Indium Tin Oxide (hereinafter called ITO) is formed on the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and a orientation layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the color filters <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are formed on the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a flat layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is layered on the color filters <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Signal electrodes <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> made of transparent conductive layer such as ITO are formed on the flat layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> so as to be orthogonal to the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in stripe form. An orientation layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the signal electrode <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Reflection layers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed by metal foil such as aluminum, and light transmitting slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed per pixel on the reflection layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. An incident light from the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; thus, the reflection layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> functions as a transflective reflective layer. Also, a forward scattering plate <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a phase differentiating plate <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are formed on the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in this order from the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the outside. A &frac14; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, a lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are formed on the outside of lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Also, a backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is attached beneath the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the above liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used in reflection mode in lighted environments, an external light which is incident from above upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and is reflected on the surface of the reflection layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and is transmitted through the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> again and is emitted to the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. When the above liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used in transparent mode in a dark environment, the light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> located beneath the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the reflection layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and is transmitted through the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and then is emitted to the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. These lights contribute to the displaying operation in each mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the above liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, what is displayed is visible regardless to whether or not there is light. However, there was a problem in which lighting of the display was not sufficient in transparent mode comparing to the reflection mode. This occurs mainly because only the light which is transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> contributed to the display operation in the transparent mode, and the light was lost in the <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the polarizing plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> formed on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when display operation is performed in a transparent mode, a light emitted from a backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is incident on a liquid crystal display device unit from outside of a lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the light which is transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> among the above light contributes to display operation. Here, in order to perform a dark display in a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the light which runs toward the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> must be a circular polarized light. Therefore, the light which is emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also must be a circular polarized light; thus, &frac14; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> for converting light which is transmitted through a lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and is converted to a linear polarized light into a circular polarized light is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Next, among lights emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, a light which is not transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and is converted into a linear polarized light which is parallel with the paper and is transmitted through the &frac14; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and becomes a circular polarized light and then reaches a reflection layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. When this light is not incident on the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is reflected by a surface close to the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, this light becomes a circular polarized light having a counter-rotation direction to the circular polarized light which is incident on the reflection layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. When this light is transmitted through the &frac14; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, this light is converted to a linear light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing. Therefore, this light is absorbed by the lower polarizing boar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel to the surface of the drawing. That is, among lights emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, all the light which is not transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is reflected on a surface close to a back side of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with regard to a case in which a light display is performed in transparent mode in a liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> light which is transmitted through the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is incident on liquid crystals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is transmitted through an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of an upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without being influenced by liquid crystals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and is emitted in an upper direction of the liquid crystal display device. However, because the light which travels toward the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> becomes a circular polarized light because of &frac14; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, almost half the light which travels toward the upper substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the slits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> when being transmitted through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Due to the above reasons, in the above liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it was not possible to illuminate the display to be brighter in a transparent mode. In order to solve the above problem, a liquid crystal display device having a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is proposed. In a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, liquid crystals <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are put between a pair of transparent lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and upper substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and an insulating layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are layered on a lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and a scanning electrode <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> made of a transparent conductive layer such as ITO in stripe form is formed thereon, and an orientation layer <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, color filters <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> are formed on an inner surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and a flat layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is layered thereon. On the flat layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, signal electrodes <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> made of a transparent conductive layer such as ITO are formed in stripe form so as to be in an orthogonal direction to the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The orientation layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the signal electrodes <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Fine aperture sections having almost 50 nm width of a reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are made of a metal layer such as aluminum in a slit form with intervals of 100 nm to 400 nm. Among incident lights to the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, polarized light which is parallel with a slit aperture section is reflected, and a polarized light which is orthogonal to the aperture section is transmitted therethrough. On an outer surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a forward scattering plate <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, a phase differentiating plate <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, and an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are disposed in this order from the upper substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the outer direction. Also, a backlight <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is disposed beneath the lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having the above structure, the light which is incident to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is a linear polarized light which is different from a circular polarized light in transparent mode. Such a property is different from the case of a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>; therefore, a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can illuminate the display in transparent mode compared to the case of a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Also, the light which is reflected without being transmitted through the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> returns to the backlight <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, and during the repetition of the reflection between the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the backlight <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, the polarization state of such light changes so as to be able to be transmitted through the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Thus, the light of the backlight <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> can be used more effectively than in the case of above liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, in the transparent mode of a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, when an external light is incident on the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, displaying contrast of the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> decreases remarkably, and the display becomes invisible sometimes according to the intensity of the external light. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a transflective reflective liquid crystal display device which has a reflection mode and a transparent mode, and can improve brightness of the display in transparent mode with superior visibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, an object of the present invention is to provide an electronic apparatus having a transflective reflective liquid crystal display device having superior visibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above objects, a transflective reflective liquid crystal device is characterized in comprising liquid crystals, an upper substrate formed on the liquid crystals, an lower substrate formed under the liquid crystals so as to face to the upper substrate, an upper polarizing layer formed between the upper substrate and the liquid crystals, a reflective polarizing layer made between the liquid crystals and the lower substrate and having a transparent axis and a reflective axis, a lower polarizing layer formed between the lower reflective polarizing layer and the lower substrate, and a lighting device. In the above transflective reflective liquid crystal device, a liquid crystal panel comprises the upper substrate, the upper polarizing layer, the liquid crystal, the lower reflective polarizing layer, the lower polarizing layer, and the lower substrate, the lighting device is arranged outside of the liquid crystal panel, the transparent axis and the reflective axis are orthogonal on the lower reflective polarizing layer, the lower reflective polarizing layer is transflective and reflective, the lower reflective polarizing layer reflects a part of light which is parallel with a reflective axis and incident and transmits a part of light which is parallel with a reflective axis, and displaying operation is performed by changing a transparent mode and a reflection mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to a structure of the present invention, the brightness of the display in a transparent mode can be improved remarkably, the problems concerning the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> can be solved, and the display contrast does not decrease even if an external light is incident on the display in a transparent mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Next, a liquid crystal display device of the present invention may comprise liquid crystals, an upper substrate formed on the liquid crystals, an lower substrate formed under the liquid crystals so as to face to the upper substrate, an upper polarizing layer formed between the upper substrate and the liquid crystals, a reflective polarizing layer formed partly between the liquid crystals and the lower substrate and having a transparent axis and a reflective axis, a lower polarizing layer formed between the lower reflective polarizing layer and the lower substrate, and a lighting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this liquid crystal display device, the lighting device may be arranged outside of the lower substrate. The transparent axis and the reflective axis may be orthogonal on the lower reflective polarizing layer, and the displaying operation may be performed by changing between a transparent mode and a reflection mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this way, according to a structure of the present invention, the brightness of the display in a transparent mode can be improved remarkably, the problems concerning the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> can be solved, and the display contrast does not decrease even if an external light is incident on the display in a transparent mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, it is preferable that transparency of the light which is parallel with a reflection axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer be between 20% and 70%, and it is more preferable that the transparency be between 30% and 50%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By making the transparency of the lower reflecting polarizing layer to be within the above range, bright display can be obtained in both transparent mode and reflection mode; thus, a liquid crystal display device having superior visibility can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> If the above transparency is less than 20%, the amount of light which is incident on the liquid crystal from the lighting device is too small, brightness of the display in a transparent mode is insufficient. If the above transparency is greater than 70%, the incident light is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer in a reflection mode and the amount of light for display is insufficient. Thus, by making the transparency within a range between 30% to 50%, the balance of the brightness in both transparent mode and reflection mode can be favorable and a liquid crystal display device having superior visibility can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing layer and a transparent axis of the lower polarizing layer should preferably be nearly orthogonal. By doing this way, when a dark display is performed in reflecting mode, almost all of the light which transmit through the reflecting polarizing layer can be absorbed by lower polarizing layer. Thus, the dark display becomes darker, the contrast can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, an angle formed by a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer and a transparent axis of the lower polarizing layer should preferably be within the range of 60 degrees to 120 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is certainly most preferable that the angle made by a transparent axis of the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> be 90 degrees (orthogonal). If the angle made by the transparent axes is in the range of &plusmn;30 degrees, practical use is possible. If the angle made by the transparent axes exceeds such range, the amount of light which is transmitted through the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> increases, and the contrast of the liquid crystal display device decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Next, in the liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a reflecting polarizing plate may be provided on outer surface of the lower polarizing layer. By employing such a structure, the light emitted from the lighting device can be used for display operation more effectively; thus, the display can be brighter in a transparent mode. Such a structure is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, an angle made by a transparent axis of the lower polarizing layer and a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing layer should preferably be in the range of &minus;30 degrees and &plus;30 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is certainly most preferable that the angle made by a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> be 0 (zero) degree (both transparent axes are parallel). If the angle made by both transparent axes is in the range of &plusmn;30 degrees, practical use is possible. The angle made by both transparent axes exceeds such a range, the amount of the light which is absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> increases, efficiency of usage of the light decreases; and thus the brightness of the display decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a scattering layer for scatter the light which is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer should preferably be formed on or above the reflecting polarizing layer. By doing this, it can be prevented that the intensity of the light which is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer increases in a particular direction; thus, the visibility of the display device becomes superior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Such a scattering layer can be obtained by forming a layer having light scattering function directly on the reflecting polarizing layer or on the inner surface of the upper substrate. A forward scatter plate may be formed on an outer surface of the upper substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, an upper polarizing layer may be formed on an inner surface of the upper substrate. According to such structure, it is not necessary to dispose a polarizing plate in outer surface of the upper substrate; thus, it becomes possible to reduce manufacturing cost. Also, such a polarizing layer can be formed successively together with a process for forming a color filter and a flattened layer on inner surface of the upper substrate; thus, it becomes possible to manufacture a liquid crystal display device of the present invention without changing the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a lower polarizing layer may be disposed on outer surface of the lower substrate. That is, a polarizing plate may be disposed on outer surface of the lower substrate. According to such a structure, a liquid crystal display device can be manufactured using a conventional polarizing plate; thus, a liquid crystal display device of the present invention can be manufactured easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a color filter may be disposed on a upper substrate or on an inner surface of the lower substrate. According to such a structure, color smearing can be restricted, and parallax can be prevented; thus, a liquid crystal display device having a superior visibility can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a lower reflecting polarizing layer can be formed by layering a ferroelectric interfering layer having prismatic structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a lower reflecting polarizing layer can be formed by making a plurality of fine slit opening section on a metal reflecting substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Next, in a electronic apparatus in the present invention is characterized in having a liquid crystal display device of the present invention which is described above. According to such a structure, an electronic apparatus having a superior display section which can obtain brightness of the display in a transparent mode. </paragraph>

In a reflection mode, dark display can be darker; thus, the contrast can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the present invention, because a liquid crystal display device of the present invention is provided, an electronic apparatus having remarkably bright display and superior contrast can be realized.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view showing a part of a cross section of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment. The present embodiment is an example of a passive matrix type transflective reflective color liquid crystal display device. In the following drawings, dimensional factors such as thickness of the layers and dimensional ratios are not to scale for the sake of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment is generally constructed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, by a liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made by disposing a lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to face each other, and disposing liquid crystal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of STN (Super Twisted Nematic) liquid crystal in a space between the substrates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (lighting device) which is disposed near the back side of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (near the outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Near the internal surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of glass and resin, the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having the same structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is formed. On the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, an electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in stripe form made of a transparent conductive foil such as ITO extends in a horizontal direction in the drawing. Orientation layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> made of polyimide or the like is layered so as to cover the electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also, near an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (lower polarizing layer) and a reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are disposed in this order. A transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are disposed so as to be almost parallel to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Near internal surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made of glass and resin, color filters <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such as those of red, green, and blue extend in directions orthogonal to the surface of drawing so as to be orthogonal to the electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in such an order and in a repeated manner, and a flattening layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for flattening bumps formed by the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is layered thereon. On the flattening layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in stripe form made of a transparent conductive layer such as one of ITO extends in a direction orthogonal to the surface of drawing, and an orientation layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of polyimide is layered on the electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Also, near an outer surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a forward scattering plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a phase differentiating plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are layered in that order. Near a bottom surface of the backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (in opposite side of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), a reflecting plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> as follows. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing an example of reflecting polarizing layer made by layering ferroelectric interference layer having prismatic structure. A reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is formed by layering a plurality of Si layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and a layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> made of TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>or the like alternately. A reflecting layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is what is called a three dimensional photonic crystal layer. Such photonic crystal made by layering layers having prismatic structure has anisotropy in light transmission characteristics. When a light is incident from above in the drawing, a light component which is orthogonal to a groove of the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits through the photonic crystal, and a light component which is parallel with the above groove is reflected. That is, a light Et which transmits through the reflecting polarizing layer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> becomes a polarized light which is orthogonal to the groove of the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a light Er which is reflected becomes a polarized light which is parallel with the above groove. In addition, layer pitch D in layers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is nearly 0.1 &mgr;m, and a pitch P of the groove which is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is nearly 3 to 5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also, light transmission ratio of the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be controlled by changing the number of layer of the above ferroelectric interference layer. That is, when the number of the layer of the ferroelectric interference layer increases, light transmission ratio of the reflecting polarizing layer decreaes, and reflection ratio increases. Therefore, a reflecting polarizing layer having necessary light transmission ration can be formed by controlling the number of the layer. Although the relationship between the transmission ratio and the number of layers is not limited to a specific ratio, when the number of the layer is 8 to 12 layers, light transmission ratio becomes 30% (reflecting ratio: 70%). In addition, if a reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is applied to a third embodiment of a liquid crystal display device which is mentioned later, reflection ratio of the polarized light which is parallel with the reflecting axis is adjusted so as to be 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The direction of the groove <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is almost parallel to a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. That is, a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed so as to almost cross orthogonally. By doing this, the light which is transmitted through the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be absorbed by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> effectively in reflection mode, dark display can be darker in a reflection mode, and the contrast of the liquid crystal display device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Also, balance of brightness between transparent mode and reflection mode can be set arbitrarily by adjusting the number of the layer of the reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. For example, when the brightness in transparent mode is preferred, the number of the layers of the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be decreased so as to enhance the transparency of the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device having the above basic structure in the present embodiment, the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed on an inner surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a &frac14; wavelength plate which is conventionally used be disposed near an outer surface of the lower substrate may be omitted. According to such a structure, in a liquid crystal display device in this embodiment, displaying operation with superior visibility is possible in both reflection mode and transparent mode. In particular, because a &frac14; wavelength plate is not disposed near an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the light which is reflected at a back side surface of the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and returns to the backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> among the light which returns to a backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be reflected by the reflection plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and returned to the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> again. According to such a structure, the light from the backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be used for the display operation effectively; thus, the brightness of the display can be remarkably enhanced to a degree greater than in a conventional structure. Above effect is explained in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> are views for explaining operation of a liquid crystal display device of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows light paths in a transparent mode and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows light paths in a reflection mode. These drawings show only necessary structures for the explanation of the present embodiment. Liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are put between an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a lower reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. A lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed on an outer surface of the lower reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. A lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is disposed beneath the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and a reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is disposed on an outer surface of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis in orthogonal direction to the surface of the drawing, and the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing. Also, the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is a transflective reflective type reflecting polarizing layer, and has a transparent axis in an orthogonal direction to the surface of the drawing and a reflecting axis which crosses orthogonally with the transparent axis. The lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> lets almost all of the light which is parallel with the transparent axis transmit through, and reflects a part of the light which is parallel with the reflecting axis and lets a part of the light which is parallel with the reflecting axis be transmitted therethrough. That is, the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a transflective reflectivity to light which is parallel with the reflecting axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A case of displaying operation in a transparent mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is explained as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a display operation in a transparent mode is performed by using light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the surface of the drawing by a lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing, and the polarized light is transmitted through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and becomes incident to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing as mentioned above. A part of the light which is parallel with the surface of the drawing and is polarized by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is reflected so as to become a reflected light <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> which returns to a near side of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and a part of the light is made a transmitted light <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is incident on the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Next, as long as electricity is charged to the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (on-state), the transmitted light <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is incident to the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> reaches to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> without being influenced by the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and is absorbed by the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to a surface of drawing; then, the dark display of the pixels are performed. On the other hand, as long as electricity is not charged to the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (off-state), the transmitted light <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is incident on the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing by a rotary polarization effect of the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and reaches to an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This light is a polarized light and is parallel with a transparent axis of the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>; thus, the light display of the pixels is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Here, the reflected light <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is reflected at a back side (beneath the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and returns to the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and is reflected by a reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> which is on an outer surface of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and is then re-used as a light which runs to the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> again. The re-used light reaches to the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> again. A part of the re-used light is transmitted therethrough and is incident on the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and a part of the re-used light is reflected and returns back to the near side of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In this way, the light which is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> while repeating reflection between the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and is used as a light which contributes to a display operation. Thus, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, among the lights which are emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the light which is transmitted through the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be used maximally; therefore, bright display can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, a case of displaying operation in reflection mode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is explained as follows. A light which is incident from above the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the surface of the drawing by an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing and is incident to the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Next, if the liquid crystal is in the on-state, the incident light reaches to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with very little influence by the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing and a reflecting axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing; thus, the light which reaches to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. After that, the light is transmitted through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing; then; the dark display of the pixels is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in the off-state, the light which is incident on the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the surface of the drawing by a rotary polarization of the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and reaches the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. A part of the polarized light is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having a reflecting axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing so as to be a reflected light <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, and a part of the polarized light is transmitted therethrough so as to be a transmitted light <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The reflected light <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing again by a rotary polarization of the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>; thus, the light display of the pixels is performed. Also, the transmitted light <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which is transmitted through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and is emitted to the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is disposed on the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; therefore, a part of the transmitted light <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and returns to the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When this light is incident on the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the pixels which is displayed in light display becomes brighter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As described above, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, display operation is possible without providing a <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> wavelength plate on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Therefore, there occurs no conversion from linear polarization to circular polarization or from circular polarization to linear polarization; thus, the light is not lost due to such conversion. Thus, brighter display can be obtained, and the brightness in transparent mode can be improved to a great extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having a conventional structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a view for explaining the operation of the above liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, only necessary structures are shown among the structures of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. That is, liquid crystals <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and backlight <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> disposed on outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> First, the transparent mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a light which is emitted from the back light <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> (lighting device) is transmitted through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and reaches the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing and a reflecting axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing, and a part of a light which reaches the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing and is incident on the liquid crystals <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. If the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is in an on-state, the incident light reaches to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> with little influence by the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing. Thus, bright display of the pixel is performed. On the other hand, if the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is in an off-state, a light which is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the surface of the drawing by a rotary polarization of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and reaches to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and is absorbed by the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing. In this way, dark display of pixels is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Next, reflection mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> light which is incident from above the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing by the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing and is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. If the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is in the on-state, the incident light reaches to the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing and is transmitted through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and is emitted to a near side of a backlight <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. In this way, dark display of the pixels is performed. On the other hand, if the liquid crystal is in an off-state, the light which is incident on the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the surface of the drawing by a rotary polarization of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and reaches the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Here, the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing; thus, the polarized light is reflected and is incident on the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> again. The incident light is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing by a rotary polarization of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. In this way, bright display of the pixels is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, there is a problem in that the contrast of the display decreases to a great extent if an external light is incident on the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a transparent mode. This is caused because the on/off state corresponding to light display and dark display of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is different. That is, when dark display of the pixels is performed, the liquid crystal is in an off-state in a transparent mode, and the liquid crystal is in an on-mode in a reflection mode. Therefore, during the transparent mode, an external light which is incident to pixels of dark display (pixels which no electricity is impressed on liquid crystal) is reflected on an upper surface of the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the upper substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and is emitted to above the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, pixels are displayed in bright display and the contrast decreases so much that the display becomes invisible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As above explained, according to a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, a light which is emitted from the lighting device can be used effectively as comparing to a conventional semi-transmitting reflecting liquid crystal display device; thus, the brightness of the display in transparent mode can be improved remarkably. Also, on/off state of the liquid crystal corresponding to bright/dark display is equalized both in transparent mode and reflection mode, when a light coming from outside in transparent mode, the contrast of the display does not decrease; thus, the vivid display can be obtained. Furthermore, a light which transmits through the liquid crystal is absorbed by a lower polarizing layer in dark display in reflecting mode; thus, dark display can be darker, and the contrast in reflecting mode can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment, a reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is disposed on outer surface of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; thus, absorption of light by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> hardly occur. Therefore, a light from the backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be used effectively for display operation, and display operation of the liquid crystal can be superior in brightness of the transparent mode. The function of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is explained in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. A liquid crystal display device shown in these drawings made by disposing a reflecting polarizing plate on an outer surface of the lower substrate of a liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> are view for explaining important section of the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention employing above structure. A liquid crystal display device shown in these drawings are made by disposing a reflecting polarizing plate on an outer surface of the lower substrate of the liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. As below, only a function of a reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> is explained in detail. The same reference numerals as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> are attached to items shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> so as to omit the explanations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing and a reflecting axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing. Display theory in this liquid crystal display device is almost the same as the transparent mode of the liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7Aand 7B</cross-reference>, and among the light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, only a polarized component which is parallel with the surface of the paper is transmitted by a reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel with the surface of the drawing, and is transmitted through the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A part of the light is transmitted through the lower reflecting polarizing layer and is incident on the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Here, if the liquid crystal is in an on-state, the incident light reaches to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and is absorbed by an upper polarizing plate having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing, and the dark display of pixels is performed. If the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in an off-state, the incident light is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the surface of the drawing by a rotary polarization of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Light display of the pixels is performed in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> is provided with a reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>; thus, brighter display can be obtained than the liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. This is because, in a liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, almost half the amount of the light emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, in contrast, in the liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7Aand 7B</cross-reference>, there occurs no absorption of the light by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> That is, because the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is disposed, among the light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the component of the light which is not parallel with a transparent axis (parallel with a surface of drawing) of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and returns to the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Because this light is reflected by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> which is disposed near an outer surface of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; thus, this light is reflected between the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. While this reflection is repeated, the state of polarization changes, and a part of the light is transmitted through the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the light which is transmitted through the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the lower reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, this light contributes to the display operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Also, among the light which is transmitted through the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, because the light which is reflected on bottom surface of the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and returns to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. While such reflection is repeated, the light which is reflected on bottom surface of the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> transmits the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>; thus, the light can be used for the display operation. Therefore, the amount of light which is transmitted through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> increases; thus, the brightness of the display in transparent mode can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Here, an angle formed by a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> should preferably be in the range of &minus;30 degrees to &plus;30 degrees. In a liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, among the light which is transmitted through the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a light component which is not parallel with a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; thus, it is certainly most preferable that the angle made by a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate and a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> be 0 (zero) degree (both transparent axes are parallel). If the angle made by both transparent axes is in the range of &plusmn;30 degrees, practical use is possible. The angle made by both transparent axes exceeds such a range, the amount of the light which is absorbed by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases, the amount of light which is absorbed by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases; thus, the effect for making display to be brighter can not be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Also, in a liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment, it is preferable that transparency of the light which is parallel with a reflection axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> be between 20% and 70%, and it is more preferable that the transparency be between 30% and 50%. By making the reflection ration of the above transflective reflecting lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be in the above-mentioned range, a liquid crystal display device which can obtain bright display both in transparent mode and reflection mode with superior visibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> If the above transparency is less than 20%, the amount of light which is incident on the liquid crystal from the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is too small, brightness of the display in a transparent mode is insufficient. If the above transparency is greater than 70%, the incident light is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a reflection mode and the amount of light for display is insufficient. Thus, by making the transparency within a range between 30% to 50%, the balance of the brightness in both transparent mode and reflection mode can be favorable and a liquid crystal display device having superior visibility can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, it is preferable that a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer and a transparent axis of the lower polarizing layer be nearly orthogonal. By doing this way, almost all of light which transmits through the reflecting polarizing layer can be absorbed by the lower polarizing layer when dark display of reflection mode is performed; thus, dark display can be darker and the contrast of the display can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, it is preferable that an angle made by transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> be in the range of 60 degrees and 120 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In a reflection mode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, when dark display is performed, a light coming from outside and incident to the liquid crystal display device is absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> finally. Among the light which transmits through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a light component which is parallel with the transparent axis of the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> transmits through the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and is emitted to near side of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. When this light is reflected by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and returns to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, dark display becomes light; thus, the contrast of the display decreases. Therefore, in a liquid crystal display device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is most preferable that an angle made by a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>) and a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>) be 90 degrees (orthogonal). As long as an angle made by both transparent axes is in the range of &plus;30 degrees, practical use is possible. If an angle made by both transparent axes exceeds such range, the amount of the light which transmits the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases; thus, the contrast of the liquid crystal display device decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Also, in a liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment, a forward scattering plate as a scattering plate is disposed on an outer surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a scattering plate can be obtained by forming a layer having light scattering function directly on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or on an inner surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the overall structure of the liquid crystal display device is similar to that of the first embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and detailed explanation is omitted. The liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment is different from the liquid crystal display device of the first embodiment in that the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is layered directly on the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the flattening layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for flattening the bumps on the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed on the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, explanation is made only on this point with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a view showing a part of cross section of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the same reference numerals are added to structures which are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, color smearing and parallax can be decreased in a reflection mode by disposing a color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This is because the light is transmitted one pixel layer (for example a red pixel layer) and is reflected by the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and is transmitted through the same pixel layer again by disposing the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> directly on the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view showing a part of a cross section of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment. The present embodiment is an example of a passive matrix type transflective reflective color liquid crystal display device. In the following drawings, the same reference numerals are added to structures which are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment is generally constructed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, by a liquid crystal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made by disposing a lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to face each other, and disposing liquid crystal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of STN (Super Twisted Nematic) liquid crystal in a space between the substrates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (lighting device) which is disposed near the back side of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (near the outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Near the internal surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of glass and resin, the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having plural fine slits on metal reflecting layer, and an insulating layer (flattening layer) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are successively layered. A scanning electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having stripe structure made of transparent conductive layer such as ITO extends in horizontal direction in drawing on this insulating layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Orientation layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> made of Polyimide or the like is layered thereon so as to cover the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also, slits (opening section) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for transmitting a light emitted from the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are disposed to each pixels on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Also, a lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are disposed in this order on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are disposed so as to be parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is disposed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. A lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is made by forming a plurality of slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in predetermined pitch on highly reflective metal reflecting layer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> such as aluminum and silver which is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A plurality of slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are parallel each other, and width of slits Ps is equal among each slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Although each dimension is not limited to specific dimension, the thickness d of the metal reflecting layer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is nearly 20 to 400 nm. The width Ps of the slits <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is 30 to 300 nm. The width Pm of one metal reflecting layer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is 30 to 300 nm. A metal reflecting layer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is layered thick so as to reflect light which is parallel with the reflecting axis by 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In a lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having such structure, when light coming from above is incident, a light component which is parallel in longitudinal direction of the slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is reflected, and a light component which is orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is transmitted. That is, the light Et which transmits through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> becomes a polarized light which is orthogonal to the slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The light Er which is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> becomes a polarized light which is parallel with the slit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In addition, when a reflecting polarizing layer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is used as a reflective polarizing layer having transflective reflective property such as the lower reflecting polarizing layer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the light transmission ratio can be controlled by changing the thickness of the layer of the metal reflecting layer. That is, when the thickness of the metal reflecting layer increases, the light transmission ratio of the reflecting polarizing layer decreases; thus, the reflection ratio increases. Accordingly, a reflecting polarizing layer having required light transmission ratio can be obtained by controlling the thickness of the layer. The relationship between the transmission ratio and the thickness of the layer is not limited specifically. When the thickness of the layer is 20 to 40 nm, the light transmission ratio becomes 30% (reflection ratio 70%). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on an inner surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made of glass and resin, color filters <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such as red, green, and blue extends in orthogonal direction of the drawing so as to be orthogonal to the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and such disposition repeats in such order. A flattened layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is layered thereon for flattening the gaps formed by color filters <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. On a flattened layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, stripe signal electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of a transparent conductive layer such as ITO extends in an orthogonal direction in the drawing. An orientation layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of polyimide is layered on the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Also, on an outer surface of the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a forward scattering plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a phase difference plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are layered on the upper substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in such order. On an outer surface of the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (opposite surface of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), an reflecting plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is made by forming plural fine slit opening sections having 30 to 300 nm width in parallel on a metal layer made of aluminum or silver as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The direction of the slit opening section is nearly parallel with a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. That is, a transparent axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a transparent axis of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed so as to be orthogonal. By doing this way, the light which transmits through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in reflection mode can be absorbed by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> effectively; thus, dark display in reflection mode can be darker, and the contrast of the liquid crystal display device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> An liquid crystal display device of the present invention having above basic structure has a lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on an inner surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a &frac14; wavelength plate which was necessary to be disposed on an outer surface of the conventional lower substrate is omitted. By doing this way, a liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment has superior visibility in display operation in reflection mode and in transparent mode. Particularly, in transparent mode, a &frac14; wavelength plate is not disposed on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, among the light which is emitted from the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the light which is reflected on a back surface of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and returns to the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be reflected by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and returned back again to the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the light from the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be used for the display operation effectively; thus, the brightness can be remarkably improved than conventional display device. The effect of such structure is explained in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> abd <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B are views for explaining an operating theory of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows a case of transparent mode, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows a light path in the case of reflection mode. In these drawings, only necessary factors for explanation among the items of the structure of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are shown. In these drawings, a liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is put between an upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the lower polarizing layer (lower polarizing plate) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are formed under the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is disposed on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (in bottom area of the drawing). The reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is disposed on an outer surface of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis in orthogonal direction to the drawing. The lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is parallel with the drawing. Also, the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the drawing and a reflecting axis which is parallel with the drawing. The opening section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for transmitting the light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is disposed on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the light which transmits through the area where the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is not disposed as a light source of the transparent mode is used in the liquid crystal display device. In this point, the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is different from the liquid crystal display device having a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> for displaying in transparent mode by transmitting a part of light component which is parallel with a reflecting axis of the lower reflecting polarizing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The display operation in transparent mode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is explained as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> First, as far as the light to be used for displaying operation which transmits through the opening section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is concerned, the light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the drawing by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel with the drawing. The light transmits through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and transmits through the opening section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. If electricity is impressed to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (on-state), the light which is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> reaches to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> without influence of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and is absorbed by the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the drawing. In this way, dark display of the pixel is performed. On the other hand, if electricity is not impressed on the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (off-state), the light which is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is converted to the polarized light which is orthogonal to the drawing by the rotary polarization effect of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and reaches to the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This light is a polarized light which is parallel with a transparent axis of the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>; thus, this light transmits through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and light display of the pixel is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Among the light which transmits through the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, as far as the light which does not transmit through the opening section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is reflected on the back surface of the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (on the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) is concerned, this light is reflected by the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and is directed to the lower substrate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. This light, then, transmits the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and returns back to the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, this light is reflcted by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> on near outer side of the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and is directed to the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to be used again. While this light repeats reflection between the reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, this light transmits through the opening section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, then the light is used as the light for the displaying operation. Therefore, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, the light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is not absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>; thus, the efficiency of the light which is emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be enhanced and lighter display operation can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next, the display operation in the reflection mode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is explained as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the light which is incident from above the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the drawing by the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the drawing, and the polarized light is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Next, if the liquid crystal is in on-state, this incident light reaches to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> without influence of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a transparent axis which is orthogonal to the drawing and a reflecting axis which is parallel with the drawing; thus, the light which reaches to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> transmits through the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The light transmits through the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a transparent axis which is parallel with the drawing. The dark display of the pixel is performed in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in off-state, the light which is incident to the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is converted to a polarized light which is parallel with the drawing by a rotary polarization effect of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and reaches to the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The light is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having a reflecting axis which is parallel with the drawing. The light is converted to a polarized light which is orthogonal to the drawing by the rotary polarization effect of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and transmits through the upper polarizing plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The light display operation is performed in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> By doing this way, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, apart from the case of the liquid crystal display device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the display operation can be performed even if a &frac14; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is not disposed on an outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Therefore, conversion such as linear polarization to circular polarization, or circular polarization to linear polarization do not occur; thus, the light loss due to such conversion does not occur. By doing in this way, lighter display can be obtained, and brightness in transparent mode can be remarkably enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Also, in a liquid crystal display device of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in an off-state in both transparent mode of a bright display and reflection mode of a bright display. The liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in an on-state in both dark display. Therefore, even if an external light is incident on the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in a transparent mode, the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in an on-state in pixels of the dark display, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the external light which is incident on the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the lower polarizing layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on outer surface of the lower substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and does not return to near side of the upper polarizing layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, the display contrast does not decrease like in the case of the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and favorable visibility can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the structure of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment, the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is disposed on an outer surface of the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a light component which is not parallel with a transparent axis of the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> among the light which is emitted from the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and returns to the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. While the reflection between the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is repeated, the polarizing state changes. The light component becomes able to transmit through the reflecting polarizing plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so as to be used for display operation. Therefore, in the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment, absorption of light by the lower polarizing plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> hardly occur; thus, the light from the backlight <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be used for the display operation effectively, the display device may become superior in the brightness of the display in transparent mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the whole structure of the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment is almost similar to the structure of the liquid crystal display device of the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the detailed description is omitted. The liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment is different from the liquid crystal display device of the third embodiment in that a color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed directly on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and in that a flattened layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for flattening gaps of the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed on the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Only such structure is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross section showing the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment. The same reference numeral is added to the items in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> as long as the items is common therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device of the present embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>; thus, the color smearing and the parallax can be decreased in reflection mode. This is possible because the color filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed directly on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, after the light transmits through one color layer (for example a red color), the light is reflected by the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and transmits through the same color layer again. Electronic Apparatus An example of electronic apparatus which is provided with a liquid crystal display device according to each embodiment is explained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Electronic apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C are provided with liquid crystal display section using liquid crystal display device with above embodiment; thus, an electronic apparatus having display section which can obtain bright display in transparent mode can be realized. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Effects of the present invention are explained in the following examples. The present invention is not limited to the following examples. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">First Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As a first example, a liquid crystal display device which is provided with a transflective reflective lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is manufactured. In the examples explained here, every liquid crystal display device is a passive matrix type transflective reflective color liquid crystal display device of which display size is 160 dots&times;120 dots with dot pitch of 0.24 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device of the first example, the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed by layering a ferroelectric interfering layer having a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The number of layers of the ferroelectric interfering layers of the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is twelve layers (thickness of each layer is about 1 &mgr;m), and the pitch of the prismatic groove is 3 &mgr;m. The transparency to the polarized light which is parallel with a reflection axis of the reflective polarizing layer was 24%. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Second Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Next, as a second example, a transflective reflective color liquid crystal display device having the same structure with the first example except that the number of the layers of the ferroelectric interfering layer of the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is 5 layers was manufactured. The transparency to the polarized light which is parallel with a reflection axis of the reflective polarizing layer was 65%. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">First Comparison Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Next, as a first comparison example, a liquid crystal display device having a conventional structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> was manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Evaluation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> For liquid crystal display devices of the above first example, second example, and the comparison example, the transparency and the reflectance corresponding to the brightness of the display operation in both transparent mode and reflection mode were measured. Also, contrast in the transparent mode and reflection mode was measured respectively. The results of these measurements are shown in TABLE 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the reflection mode, it was confirmed that the reflectance of the liquid crystal display device of the first example was 3%, and such transparency was equivalent to the case of the liquid crystal display device of the first comparison example, and the contrast in reflection mode was enhanced. The enhancement of the contrast is because the dark display became darker even though the light display remained the same. Also, in the liquid crystal display device of the second example, the reflectance decreases and the contrast in reflection mode deceased slightly as compared to the liquid crystal display device of the first example because the liquid crystal display device was designed with more emphasis on the brightness in a transparent mode.

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As a third example, a liquid crystal display device having an opening section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> was manufactured. In every liquid crystal display device is a passive matrix type transflective reflective color liquid crystal display device of which display size is 160 dots&times;120 dots with dot pitch of 0.24 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In a liquid crystal display device of the third example, the lower reflective polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed by layering a ferroelectric interfering layer having a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The thickness of the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is 300 nm. The pitch of the slits is 150 nm. The width of the slit is 75 nm. Also, two opening sections of which size is 0.068 mm&times;0.022 mm (the area where the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not formed) is formed on the lower reflecting polarizing layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> per each pixel so as to be diagonal against the pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Evaluation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> For liquid crystal display devices of the above third example and the comparison example, the transparency and the reflectance corresponding to the brightness of the display operation in both transparent mode and reflection mode were measured. Also, contrast in the transparent mode and reflection mode was measured respectively. The results of these measurements are shown in TABLE 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As shown in TABLE 2, in a liquid crystal display device of the third embodiment in the present invention, it was affirmed that the transparency enhanced more than three times in comparing to the liquid crystal display device of the first comparison example. Also, it was affirmed that the contrast of the display in the transparent mode was twice as much as the first comparison example. This is because the liquid crystal display device of the third embodiment can use the light from the back light <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for display operation effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the reflectance ratio of the liquid crystal display device of the third embodiment is 30%. Although this is almost equal to the case of the liquid crystal display device of the first comparison example, it was affirmed that the contrast of the display in reflection mode improved remarkably. Such improvement was achieved because dark display became darker while the brightness of the light display remained.
