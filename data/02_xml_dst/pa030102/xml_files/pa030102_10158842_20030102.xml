<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a head suspension assembly incorporated in a disk device, a disk device, and a head suspension assembly manufacturing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a magnetic disk device, there has been conventionally known a hard disk drive (which will be simply referred to as an HDD hereinafter) which is used as an external storage device of, e.g., a computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The HDD includes a magnetic disk provided in a case, a spindle motor which supports and drives to rotate the magnetic disk, a head suspension assembly (which will be referred to as an HSA hereinafter) having a head which reads/writes information with respect to the magnetic disk mounted at an end thereof, and a voice coil motor which oscillates the HSA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The HSA has a slider chip to which the head is formed, a suspension having the slider chip attached at an end thereof through a flexure, and an arm which supports a base end portion of the suspension. A wiring pattern is formed on the suspension and the arm, the slider chip is bonded and fixed to the flexure on the wiring pattern, and the head is electrically connected to the wiring pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the HSA supports the base end portion of the arm by a bearing assembly so as to be capable of swiveling, and it can hence oscillate by the voice coil motor and move the head provided at the end of oscillation to an arbitrary position on the magnetic disk. That is, information can be read from and written into the magnetic disk by the head by rotating the magnetic disk and oscillating the HSA. Incidentally, at this moment, the slider chip slightly flies on the magnetic disk by the pressure of air generated by rotation of the magnetic disk. A surface of the slider chip which is opposed to the magnetic disk is called an Air bearing Surface (which will be referred to as an ABS hereinafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In recent years, with the increase in the throughput capacity of computers, applications which require highly advanced processing are becoming widespread and the quantity of data processed is increasing. Therefore, the demand for realization of larger capacity HDDs is increasing. Furthermore, as the HDD which is mounted on a portable machine such as a notebook computer, the demand for reduction in size is also increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to realize an HDD with a large capacity and small dimensions, the recording density of the magnetic disk storage medium must be increased. As methods for increasing the recording density, increasing the linear recording density along the track direction and increasing the recording density along the radial direction of the magnetic disk while narrowing the track width and the track pitch are utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In particular, in order to increase the linear recording density, data must be recorded on the magnetic disk with a steep magnetic gradient and sufficient magnetic strength. In order to realize this, a flying height of the slider chip from the magnetic disk must be stabilized, and a flying posture must be very stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the case of manufacturing a conventional HSA, however, since the center (pivot) of the slider chip is mechanically positioned with respect to the flexure provided at the end of the suspension and attached by adhesive, displacement of the pivot, i.e., a tolerance is large, and it is very hard to set the attachment position of the slider chip to a designed value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When the tolerance of the pivot deviates from the designed value and becomes large, a flying height of the slider chip deviates from a designed value, and a pitch or roll is generated in the slider chip, which leads to an unstable flying posture. When the flying posture of the slider chip becomes unstable, a steep magnetic gradient and sufficient magnetic strength cannot be imparted to the magnetic disk, and a linear recording density with respect to the magnetic disk cannot be increased. Also, reduction in size of the HDD and increase in the capacity of the HDD can not be attained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In view of the above-described drawbacks, it is an object of the present invention to provide a head suspension assembly which enables a high-density recording with respect to a disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To achieve this aim, according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a head suspension assembly, a slider chip including a head being attached to a suspension through a flexure, the slider chip being set on the flexure which is horizontally set, solder being set between at least one first land formed on the slider chip and at least one second land formed at a predetermined position on the flexure in accordance with this at least one first land, all sets of solder being simultaneously fused, the slider chip being subjected to self alignment and fixed to the flexure by utilizing the surface tension of the solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a head suspension assembly manufacturing method comprising: fixing and adjusting an inclination of a suspension in such a manner that a flexure becomes substantially horizontal; setting a slider chip on the flexure; setting solder between at least one first land formed on the slider chip and at least one second land formed at a predetermined position on the flexure in accordance with the at least one first land; simultaneously fusing all sets of solder; and subjecting the slider chip to self alignment with respect to the flexure by utilizing the surface tension of the solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiments, the slider chip can be subjected to self alignment with respect to the flexure by utilizing the surface tension of the solder set between the first and second lands. Therefore, the slider chip does not have to be mechanically positioned and bonded to the flexure as with the prior art, and the slider chip can be accurately positioned and attached to the flexure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Embodiments according to the present invention will now be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a schematic structure of a hard disk drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (which will be referred to as an HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> hereinafter) (disk device) including a head suspension assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (which will be referred to as an HAS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is opened on the upper surface and has a rectangular box-like shape and a non-illustrated top cover which is screwed to the case by a plurality of screws and closes an opening at an upper end of the case. That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the state that the top cover is removed in order to illustrate the inner structure of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are accommodated two magnetic disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (disks) which are an example of a magnetic storage medium, a spindle motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which supports and drives to rotate the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, four HSAs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having at each end a later-described magnetic head which reads/writes data with respect to the both sides of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a bearing assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which supports the HSAs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to be capable of swiveling with respect to the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a voice coil motor (which will be referred to as a VCM hereinafter) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> used for swiveling and positioning each HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a ramp load mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which holds the magnetic head of each HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a position distanced from the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when that magnetic head has moved to the outermost periphery of the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a base board unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Further, a non-illustrated printed circuit board which controls the operation of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the VCM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the magnetic heads through the base board unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is screwed on the outer surface of the bottom wall of the case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Each magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on a base board formed of, e.g., glass or aluminium and has magnetic recording layers on the upper and lower surfaces thereof. The magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coaxially fitted to a non-illustrated hub of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and held by a clamp spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the two magnetic disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are driven to rotate by the spindle motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a predetermined speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The four HSAs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are caused to oscillate around the bearing assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by the VCM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the magnetic head provided at each end is moved (sought) on a desired track on the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Then, data is read and written with respect to the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the magnetic head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As will be described later, the magnetic head is formed to the later-described slider chip used for forming a small gap between itself and the surface of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This slider chip is attached to a later-described flexure provided at the end of the later-described suspension of the HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and pressure is applied to the slider chip in the direction of the magnetic disk by the spring function of the suspension. Moreover, during the operation of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the slider chip functions to cause the magnetic head to fly on the surface of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a substantially fixed distance by the air pressure generated by rotation of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a partial bottom view showing the vicinity of the end portion of the HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to a first embodiment of the present invention seen from the direction of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a side view showing the vicinity of this end portion from the horizontal direction. It is to be noted that the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is partially omitted for clarifying the illustration and only the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cut at the center in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as a cross-sectional view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by a thin plate of stainless steel at the end of the non-illustrated arm. A convex portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which presses the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the direction of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed at a predetermined central position in the vicinity of the end of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This convex portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed so as to protrude toward the lower surface side of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by partially thrusting a predetermined position of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from its upper surface side. Additionally, to the end of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided a lift tab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to protrude therefrom, which is supported by the above-described ramp load mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when the magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged at a position distanced from the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed by a thin plate of stainless steel is accurately positioned and attached to the lower surface side of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extends along the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and forms a cantilever-like plate piece portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(which will be referred to as a mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>hereinafter) used for mounting the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by forming a substantially-U-shaped hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the vicinity of the end of the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is pressed by the convex portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and slightly pushed down in the direction of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from other portion. Further, a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed in the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to the magnetic head is formed on the surface of the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed by patterning copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on polyimide film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it leads along the both edges in the longitudinal direction of the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from a non-illustrated arm of the HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and extends to the surface of the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. There are four copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and they are used for writing and reading data. Each end of these wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extends to the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Each end of the four copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also functions as a second land according to the present invention. It is to be noted that a cover layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is provided on the copper wire <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>except a part in the vicinity of the end of the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In other words, the copper wire <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is exposed only in the vicinity of the end of the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A substantially rectangular block-like slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached on the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes the magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the end surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the side opposed to the ends of the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Further, four connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which are electrically connected to each copper wire <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed on the end surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. These four connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>also function as the first lands according to the present invention. It is to be noted that the surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the side of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> opposed to the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> functions as an Air Bearing Surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(which will be referred to as an ABS <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>hereinafter) which causes the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to float from the surface of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through an air layer generated by rotation of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in order to increase the capacity of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while reducing the size, the recording density of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must be raised. As methods of increasing the recording density, increasing the linear recording density along the track direction of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and increasing the recording density along the radial direction of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by narrowing the track width and the track pitch are possible. For example, in order to increase the linear recording density, data must be recorded on the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a steep magnetic gradient and sufficient magnetic strength. Accordingly, a flying height of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must be stabilized and the flying posture must be caused to enter the very stable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in this embodiment, the center (pivot) of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is accurately positioned with respect to the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached to the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As a result, the displacement of the pivot, namely, a tolerance can be suppressed to approximately several aim, and the flying posture of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A method of accurately positioning the pivot of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (first lands) formed by copper foils (only one land is shown) are previously formed on three end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (except an end surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>including the magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) for positioning. Each of the three lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed into a rectangular shape whose length does not exceed each of the end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. In particular, the two lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed to the opposed end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are formed with the same length and the same shape. On the other hand, lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (second lands) formed by copper foils (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) are also previously formed at corresponding positions on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in accordance with the respective lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The three lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed to have the same length as the corresponding lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the width of each of the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is designed to 10 &mgr;m or lower, and each of the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is positioned in such a manner that a distance between the corresponding lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is 0 to 25 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by bonding the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>together with the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. By doing so, the respective connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are simultaneously electrically connected to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this case, the inclination of the suspension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is first adjusted and fixed in such a manner that the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes substantially horizontal. In this state, the pivot of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is positioned with respect to the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In other words, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set in an area surrounded by the three mounts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the tip of four copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. At this moment, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> does not have to be accurately positioned nor temporarily bonded by using, e.g., an adhesive. In addition, at this moment, the three lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>function as stoppers which mechanically position the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by utilizing their thicknesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Additionally, non-illustrated elongated solder is set between the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> respectively formed on the end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and solder is set between the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed on the end surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For example, the solder which connects the respective connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>with the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a shape such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B, and it does not roll when set on the horizontally-arranged copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In particular, the substantially spherical solder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is preferable since it has an excellent laser irradiation efficiency. Further, the non-illustrated solder which connects the elongated lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed to have a length corresponding to the length of the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a shape by which it does not roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the state that the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set at a predetermined position on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the solder is set at predetermined positions, all sets of solder are simultaneously irradiated with the laser beam and concurrently fused. As a result, the fused solder spreads to the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the four end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are pulled in the directions distanced from each other by the surface tension of the solder. Consequently, the pivot of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is automatically positioned (self alignment) at a predetermined position on the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At this moment, the quantity of each set of solder, and shapes, sizes, positions or the like of the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are accurately determined in advance. In particular, the two lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed to the opposed end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the two lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed to the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in accordance with the former lands are designed to have the same shape, size, position or the like in such a manner that the same quantity of the solder pulls the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the same surface tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, after self alignment of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, when the fused solder is cooled down and becomes hard, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached and fixed on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Incidentally, when the displacement of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is generated before the solder is cooled down, the displacement is generated at the pivot of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. However, by adopting bonding using the solder as with this embodiment, self alignment of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be repeated by again fusing the solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to this embodiment, even if the displacement of the pivot is generated when the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the displacement of the pivot can be automatically corrected by the self alignment effect utilizing the surface tension of the solder. A quantity of correction at this moment varies depending on a quantity of the solder. In this embodiment, the value of displacement correction is set to approximately 25 &mgr;m, and a particle size of the solder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is set to, e.g., 30 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to self alignment and fixed on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the positioning accuracy of the pivot can be suppressed to a tolerance of the several &mgr;m order. This tolerance is extremely smaller than a conventional mechanical positioning tolerance (several-ten &mgr;m order), and the flying posture of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be thereby greatly stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, since each interval between the four connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed on the end surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is only tens of Am, which is very small, a defect such as a solder bridge may be possibly generated between the adjacent terminals when the four connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are simultaneously bonded at the time of self alignment of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Therefore, only the two connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on the both sides may be bonded to the corresponding copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the time of self alignment of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be attached and fixed to the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thereafter, the remaining two connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be connected to the remaining copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when it is difficult to simultaneously and evenly fuse the solder having shapes such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> and the elongated solder (not shown) used for bonding the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a plurality of lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>divided into multiple pieces may be formed on the three end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> plurality of lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be also formed to the corresponding polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the solder having shapes such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be set between these lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are reduced in size in this manner, although the number of laser beams used for fusing the solder must be increased, the spot shape of the beam can be minimized, and all sets of solder including the solder used for bonding the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be easily and simultaneously fused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> land <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>dedicated to self alignment may be additionally provided on the end surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed. Here, the dedicated land <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed between the second connection terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the third connection terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In this case, a land <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having the same shape is also formed at a corresponding position of the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As a result, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be subjected to self alignment by using the lands <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>without bonding the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>at the time of self alignment of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be attached and fixed on the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be thereafter connected to the respective copper wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this case, the possibility of generation of solder bridges between the respective connection terminals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be eliminated in self alignment, and any other bonding material other than the solder can be selected as the bonding material for self alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be bonded to the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the four corners of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in order to subject the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to self alignment. That is, four L-shaped lands <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which extend on the adjacent two end surfaces forming the four corner portions of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed, and four L-shaped lands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are also formed at corresponding parts of the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Then, the solder is set to these four pairs of the lands <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and all sets of solder are simultaneously fused by laser, thereby subjecting the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to self alignment. In this case, since each pair of lands <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> restrict the degree of freedom of movement of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the two directions, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be further accurately positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a partial bottom view showing the vicinity of an end portion of a head suspension assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (which will be referred to as an HSA <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> hereinafter) according to a second embodiment of the present invention from the direction of the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is to be noted that the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is directly attached on the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the HSA <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and any other structure of the HSA <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the HSA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> That is, in this embodiment, the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extending along the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> terminate in the vicinity of the copper wire <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Additionally, the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is exposed, and three lands <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are directly formed on the exposed mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. These lands <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> function similarly with the lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment and subject the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to self alignment by utilizing the surface tension of the solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In this case, an advantage similar to that of the first embodiment can be obtained, and it is possible to obtain the advantage by which static electricity of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transformed to the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the land <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the land <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the first and second embodiments, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the head suspension assembly can be accurately positioned on the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by self alignment utilizing the surface tension of the solder. As a result, the flying posture of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be highly stabilized, and high-density recording with respect to the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general invention concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the first and second embodiments described above, the copper lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are soldered to the copper lands <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) provided on the polyimide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and are thereby set in self-alignment. Nonetheless, the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be made of other metal that exhibits good wettability with solder. Alternatively, the solder may be replaced by material that has good wettability with copper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For example, a fluorocarbon resin coating may be selected as a material for the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>), and acrylic or epoxy plastic which is of an ultraviolet curing type may be selected as a bonding material in order to be used instead of solder. In this case, after subjecting the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to self alignment, applying ultraviolet light to the bonding material and curing it can suffice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, a fluorocarbon resin coating may be applied to parts other than the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>), and the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) may be adhered to each other using an acrylic or epoxy adhesive. In this case, after subjecting the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to self alignment, the adhesive becomes solid and fixed by irradiation of ultraviolet light. In this manner, by applying a fluorocarbon resin coating to the parts other than the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) in advance, the adhesive can be prevented from being accidentally attached to the parts other than the lands <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the foregoing embodiments, although description has been given as to the case where the four end surfaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are bonded to the polyimide <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(or the mount piece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the flexure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to self alignment, the present invention is not restricted thereto, and bonding at least one, or more preferably, at least two end surfaces can suffice. In this case, the slider chip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be likewise subjected to self alignment. </paragraph>
