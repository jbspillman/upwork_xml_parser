<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a solar cell structural body comprising a solar cell and a concrete member, particularly a solar cell structural body comprising a solar cell arranged on a concrete retaining body such that part of a conductor portion of said solar cell is contacted with said concrete retaining body a solar cell array and a sunlight power generation system in which said solar cell structural body is used. The term &ldquo;conductor portion&rdquo; in the present invention means an exposed conductor portion extending from the electrode of the solar cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, societal consciousness of the problems relating to the environment and energy has been increasing all over the world. Particularly, the earth warming because of the so-called greenhouse effect due to an increase of atmospheric CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>has been predicted to cause a serious problem. In view of this, public attention has been focused on a sunlight power generation system (that is, a solar cell power generation system) for the reason that it is a clean power generation system which generates electric power using sunlight, which is evenly accessible at any place In the world, as the power generation energy source, and which can attain relatively high power generation efficiency without necessity of using a complicated large installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Presently, as such sunlight power generation system, a variety of solar cell modules have been using at certain private residential buildings and at certain public facilities and also for portable appliances. However, such solar cell modules are still expensive. This situation has presented a major obstacle in making solar cell modules to be more widely spread for use not only private residential buildings and but also at public facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As one of the measures to comply with this, there can be mentioned a manner of integrating a solar cell module with a relatively inexpensive product in a different industrial field to diminish the total cost. As a typical example of a solar cell module of the type installed on a building structural body, there can be mentioned a trestle installation type solar cell module comprising a framed solar cell module installed on a trestle provided on a roof and a building material integral type solar cell module comprising a solar cell module integrated with a building material. These solar cell modules presently have being spotlighted for the reasons that the material cost can be diminished because a roofing material as a separate member is not required to use and the construction cost upon the installation can be diminished because they can be installed in the same manner in the ordinary roof installation, where the solar cell modules can be installed on a roof of a building at a relatively low cost in terms of the total cost. In addition, the roof installed with any of these solar cell modules becomes to have a beautiful exterior appearance which is in harmony with ambient roofs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Solar cell modules in recent years which are represented by aforementioned solar cell modules are of value-added types integrated with products in various industrial fields. To be more specific, these solar cell modules share the material costs and the production costs of the two members, and when the shared costs are considered as the total cost, it can be said that the total cost is markedly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Separately, for the sunlight power generation system, it is expected to be used at power generation facilities in the near future as a new energy source to replace the present energy source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in order to comply with the consumption power which has been continuously increasing year by year, power generation facilities have been newly established in recent years. Particularly, the consumption power becomes significant during day time when people work in the offices and the like where it often reaches a peak mainly due to a significant increase in the energy consumed in operating the equipments used for the office works and the like. In addition, especially during summer time, the consumption power frequently reaches a peak due to a marked increase in the energy consumed in operating the coolers. This phenomenon to reach the peak in terms of the consumption power is generally called an energy peak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Now, the power generation facilities newly established up to the present time include thermal power stations, hydraulic power stations, atomic power stations and the like. However, in recent years, in the light of prevention of the earth warming, environmental protection and the like, sunlight power generation, wind power generation, geothermal power generation and the like have been spotlighted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The peak energy time zone in summer time or day time is a time zone when sunlight is irradiated. Thus, public attention is focused on a sunlight power generation plant where a sunlight power generation system having a performance capable of generating a large energy (power) in the peak energy time zone is used as the power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, in the case where a solar cell module is used as the sunlight power generation system as the power source in the sunlight power generation plant, the power generation cost (the cost of the power generated) becomes very high as long as an ordinary solar cell module is used as said solar cell module. In order to improve this situation, it is considered to be effective to adopt the foregoing manner in that a solar cell module is integrated with a relatively inexpensive product in a different industrial field so as to share the material costs and the production costs of the two members, whereby the total cost is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, when referred to such solar cell module used as the power source in the sunlight power generation plant, the essential function is to generate a power and other functions are not necessitated. To be more specific, in order to together use with the power source in the thermal power station or the like, it is a very important factor to use not such value-added solar cell module but a relevant solar cell module which is the same as the power source in the the thermal power station or the like in terms of the power generation cost. In the light of prevention of the earth warming, environmental protection and the like, it is ideal to use only a relevant sunlight power generation system which provides clean energy However, the sunlight power generation system is excessively costly, it is almost impossible that the new power source replaces the conventional power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, any of the presently available solar cell modules which are costly in terms of the cost of the power generated is very difficult to use as the power source in the power plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The foregoing power generation cost is obtained from the equation: power generation cost&minus;&lsqb;(annual apparatus cost) &plus;(annual repair cost&plus;annual maintenance cost)&plus;(annual fuel cost)&rsqb;/(annual generated power quantity). The annual apparatus cost here means a cost obtained by dividing the total construction expense (the total initial investment amount) by the service life year of the power generation system. However, in this case, the interests must be taken into consideration. The &ldquo;annual repair cost&plus;annual maintenance cost&rdquo; means the sum of the annual expenses required for the maintenance of the power generation system. The annual fuel cost means the sum of the annual expenses required for the fuel necessary to operate the power generation system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the case of a sunlight power generation system in which a solar cell module is used, unlimited solar energy which is evenly accessible at any place in the world is used in order to generate electric power and therefore, the above-mentioned annual fuel cost is not necessitated. In addition, the &ldquo;annual repair cost&plus;annual maintenance cost&rdquo; does not become considerable. A main factor to increase the power generation cost in the case of the sunlight power generation system is the annual apparatus cost, where the watt cost of the solar cell module is considerable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Under such circumstance, in order to make the use of the sunlight generation system to be more widely spread and in order to make the sunlight generation system capable of being used as the power source in the power generation station, it is essential to greatly reduce the power generation cost. To be more specific, it is essential that the watt cost of the solar cell module and the apparatus cost are reduced so that the power generation cost is competitive with that in any of the current power generation systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the following, description will be made of the foregoing cost relating to the solar cell module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the case of a sunlight power generation system in which a solar cell module, the system is designed on the assumption that ordinary people who are not acquainted with electric things including solar cells will use and touch the system. For doing in this way, a number of materials are necessary to be used in order to enhance the security and because of this, the material cost is unavoidably increased. In addition, thermocompression process is required to perform in the production of the solar cell module, where the man-hour becomes considerable and the productivity is reduced. Thus, the production cost of the solar cell module is eventually raised. That is, the power generation cost as a whole is raised. As long as the solar cell module is produced in this way, there is a limit for reducing the watt cost of the solar cell module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the case of a solar cell module used in the power generation station, the solar cell module is used under controlled environment. The controlled environment here means a location where only specialists (handling persons) who are acquainted with electric things including solar cells are admitted to enter therein but any other persons are prohibited from entering therein. In order to establish such controlled atmosphere, it takes a measure such that a fence or a wall is provided around an external enclosure for the solar cell module or/and a key is provided at the entrance of the location where the solar cell module is present. And the controlled atmosphere is made so that the handling persons can perform periodical maintenance works for the solar cell module. Because the solar cell module is used under such controlled environment, the specification relating to the safety and insulation of the solar cell module can be mitigated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For the installation method of the solar cell module, there are known a method wherein a frame body is provided at a solar cell module and the frame body is installed on a trestle and a method wherein a steel plate is provided at the back face side of a solar cell module and the steel plate is processed, followed by being installed on a trestle. However these methods have disadvantages such that a number of materials are required to be used, along with this the number of operations is increased, and as a result, the installation cost is raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In order to diminish the installation cost, there are various proposals of a method wherein a solar cell module is provided at a relatively inexpensive concrete member capable of being used as a back face member or a trestle for the solar cell module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Particularly, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 11(1999)-270023 (hereinafter referred to as document 1) discloses a wall panel (a panel for a wall) which comprises a panel main body comprising a light weight foamed concrete member provided with a recessed portion having a prescribed depth at the surface thereon and a solar cell module embedded in said recessed portion. document 1 describes that because the solar cell module is installed in the recessed portion of the concrete member so as to integrate with the panel main body, not only the execution work efficiency but also the maintenance work efficiency are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No, 2001-60704 (hereinafter referred to as document 2) discloses a photoelectric conversion apparatus comprising a first electrode layer, a semiconductor layer and a second electrode layer sequentially tacked in this order on a substrate, and a sealing resin film disposed to cover the surface of the second electrode layer, wherein a tentative peeling film is clad on the sealing resin film through an adhesive later such that the tentative peeling film is capable of being peeled, and wherein the adhesive later after the tentative peeling film is peeled has a sticky face to a member on which the photoelectric conversion apparatus is mounted. In document 2, there are illustrate a concrete plate, a slate plate, a roof tile, a metal plate, and the like. Document 2 describes that because of using the tentative peeling film, not only the execution work efficiency but also the maintenance work efficiency are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Japanese Laid-open Utility Model Publication No. 5(1993)-3430 (hereinafter referred to as document 3) discloses a power generation roof tile comprising a roof tile main body made of a cement or a metal and a solar cell bonded on the surface of a functioning portion of the roof tile main body, wherein an opaque sheet which is difficult to slip is bonded on the surface of the solar cell in a state capable of being peeled. Document 3 describes that when the power generation roof tile is installed, power generation by the solar cell does not takes place because the solar cell is covered by the opaque sheet and therefore, the execution work can be securely performed while preventing the surface of the solar call from being damaged or stained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the case of a power generation station or the like it which a sunlight power generation system is used as the power source, all the accommodations are necessary to be installed within a controlled environment, where any person besides the persons concerned who are acquainted with electric things is not allowed to enter therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present inventors conceived a solar cell structural body having a solar cell whose conductor portions are partly contacted with a concrete retaining body provided to retain said solar cell from the non-light receiving face side, which would be suitable to install in such controlled environment as described in the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(B) are schematic views for explaining a solar cell whose exposed conductor portions are partly contacted with a concrete retaining body (not shown) provided to retain the solar cell from the non-light receiving face side. Particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A) is a schematic view illustrating a solar cell &lsqb;which is retained on a concrete retaining body (not shown)&rsqb; before a weathering-resistant coat film is formed thereon. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(B) is a schematic view illustrating said solar cell after said weathering-resistant coat film is formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(B), reference numeral <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> indicates a photovoltaic element, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> a positive electrode, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> a negative electrode, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> a weathering-resistant coat film. The solar cell means a structure comprising a photovoltaic element <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>, a positive electrode <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and a negative electrode <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By forming a weathering-resistant coat film <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> on the light-receiving face side of the solar cell as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(B), it is possible to make the solar cell &lsqb;see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A)&rsqb; have weathering-resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, the photovoltaic element <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is made so as to have weathering-resistance by forming the weathering-resistant coat film <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> so as to cover the light-receiving face thereof, wherein for the positive electrode <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and the negative electrode <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>, at least their portions which serve to electrically connect the solar cell with an adjacent solar cell (not shown) are exposed without being covered by the coat film, where there will be an occasion in that the exposed portions (that is, the exposed conductor portions) of the positive and negative electrodes of the solar cell are directly contacted with the concrete retaining body (not shown). And if the structure should be such that a clearance is present between the solar cell and the concrete retaining body, there will be an occasion in that aforesaid exposed conductor portions of the positive and negative electrodes of the solar cell are indirectly contacted with the concrete retaining body through rain water or the like present in said clearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Now, the present inventors conducted trials in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Focusing on a relatively inexpensive concrete member as a trestle, a plate member made of a concrete was arranged on the ground and the base member of the foregoing solar cell is directly mounted on the concrete plate member to form a solar cell installed structural body (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;solar cell structural body&rdquo;). In this way, a plurality of solar cell structural bodies were formed. And these solar cell structural bodies were connected with each other in series connection to form a solar cell array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The solar cell array thus formed was subjected to power generation. As a result, it was found that such shortcomings as will be described below and which are required to solve are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> That is, in the case of a solar cell structural body in which a concrete member is used as the retaining body, as the concrete member, there is used a concrete member which is generally formed from a mixture composed of a cement, water, an aggregate (comprising fine aggregates and rough aggregates) and the like. Thus, the electric resistance value of the concrete member greatly differs depending on the mixing ratio of these materials. In addition, because the concrete member has water absorption properties, the specific resistance value (the resistivity) thereof is reduced when the concrete member absorbs water. Therefore, depending on the installation form of the solar cell structural body, there will be entailed a problem such that leakage current from the exposed conductor portions of the solar cell which are contacted with the concrete member is flown to the installation face while passing through the concrete member, where a large power loss is occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is aimed at solving the foregoing problem occurred because the exposed conductor portions of the solar cell are contacted with the concrete member as described in the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a solar cell structural body which is always free from aforesaid problem without depending on the installation form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a solar cell array in which said solar cell structural body is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a sunlight power generation system in which said solar cell structural body is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A typical embodiment of the solar cell structural body of the present invention has a solar cell arranged on a concrete retaining body comprising a concrete prepared from a mixture comprising at least a cement, water and an aggregate, such that part of a conductor portion of said solar cell is contacted with said concrete retaining body, characterized in that said concrete member has a resistivity in a range of from 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 120&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The solar cell structural body of the present invention is preferred to additionally include the following features: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> that the water cement ratio of the concrete upon the production thereof is less than 40% in terms of a weight ratio; </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As previously described, the present invention typically provides a solar cell structural body having a solar cell arranged on a concrete retaining body comprising a concrete prepared from a mixture comprising at least a cement, water and an aggregate, such that part of a conductor portion of said solar cell is contacted with said concrete retaining body, characterized in that said concrete has a resistivity in a range of from 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 120 &times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the following, typical preferred embodiments of the solar cell structural body of the present invention will be described while referring to the drawings. It should be understood that the present invention is not restricted by these embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> First, description will be made or a method for measuring a resistivity of a concrete member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the measurement of an electric resistance of a sample to be inspected (this sample will be hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;inspective sample&rdquo;), there is present a relationship of R&equals;E/I (Ohm&apos;s law) between electric resistance R(Q), voltage E(V) and electric current I(A). Therefore, in the present inventions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, by connecting an alternating current through a pair of metal electrodes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> arranged to oppose to each other through an inspective sample <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (comprising a concrete member) which is arranged between said pair of metal electrodes, a voltage between the two electrodes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is measured. The reason why the alternating current is used is for eliminating a cause of entailing a measurement error with respect to an electric resistance due to the polarization action at an interface between each of the two electrodes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the inspective staple <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. As the alternating current, there is used an alternate current outputted from an AC standard voltage and current generator <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> (output current; 1 mA to 60A: output voltage: 1 mV to 1200 V; output frequency 40 to 500 Hz). For the measurement aforesaid voltage, there is used a digital multiple meter <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (the measurement of a voltage at a given alternating current and at a given direct current and the measurement of an electric current can be performed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The resistivity (Qcm) of the concrete member was computed by the equation; &equals;(E/I)&times;(A/L), with E being a measured voltage (V) between the two electrode, I being an electric current (A), A being a cross section area (cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and L being an interval between the two electrodes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, where said interval corresponds to the length of the concrete member <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> At the time of measuring the electric resistance, the inspective sample <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (the concrete member) is sufficiently contacted with the two electrodes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> by means of a G-clamp <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. In the case where the inspective sample <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is a concrete member hardened in water, moisture on the surface of the concrete member is sufficiently swabbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of interrelation between power loss of the solar cell structural body and a concrete retaining body used therein in the case of a solar cell array comprising a plurality of solar cell structural bodies electrically connected with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Here, each of the solar cell structural bodies of the solar cell array has such structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A), reference numeral <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> indicates a solar cell comprising a photovoltaic element <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a positive electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a negative electrode <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and a weathering-resistant coat film <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> indicates a concrete retaining body in a plate form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It is presumed that the solar cell structural bodies of the solar cell array are made to be in a state that electric current generated by each of the solar cell structural bodies is the most likely to flow to the ground, that is, the solar cell structural bodies are directly installed on the ground such that the contact area of the surface of the ground with the concrete retaining body (in a plate form) which is contacted with the exposed conductor portion of the solar cell of each solar cell structural body becomes maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B) is a schematic diagram illustrating a circuit in this case. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B), reference numeral <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> indicates a solar cell, reference numeral <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> a concrete retaining body, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the maximum output voltage of the entire solar cell array is made to be Vmp(V), the maximum output current of each solar cell is made to be Imp (A), the contact area of the conductor portion of each solar cell with the concrete retaining body is made to be S(cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), the thickness of each concrete retaining body is made to be d(cm), the power loss of the entire solar cell array is made to be P<highlight><subscript>loss</subscript></highlight>(%), the resistance between each solar cell and the ground is made to be r(&OHgr;), and the resistivity of each concrete retaining body is made to be &rgr; (&OHgr;&middot;cm), the following equation is established.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>P<highlight><subscript>loss</subscript></highlight>&equals;(Vmp/2)&times;(1/r)&times;(1/Imp)&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, presuming that there is substantially no contact resistance between each concrete retaining body and the ground, the following equation is established between the resistance r(&OHgr;) between the ground and the solar cell and the resistivity &rgr; (&OHgr;&middot;cm) of the concrete retaining body.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>r&ap;&rgr;&times;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d/S</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thus, for a solar cell array comprising a plurality of solar cell structural bodies electrically connected with each other, interrelations between the power losses of the solar cell structural bodies and the concrete retaining bodies can be obtained, when the maximum output voltage Vmp(V) of the entire solar cell array, the maximum output current Imp (A) of each solar cell, the contact area S(cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) of the conductor portion of each solar cell with the concrete retaining body, the thickness d (cm) of each concrete retaining body, and the resistivity &rgr; (&OHgr;&middot;cm) of each concrete retaining body are found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For instance, in the case where a sunlight power generation system is prepared using the solar cell array of the present invention, when the number of the series connections of the solar cells is decreased while the number of the parallel connections is increased, it is possible that some of the related components such as diodes are cut to reduce the production cost. In this case, there is a tendency in that the maximum output voltage becomes small but the maximum output current becomes large. Separately, when the thickness of the concrete retaining body is increased, the resistivity thereof is increased and besides, the wind endurance strength of the system is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph exemplifying interrelations between power losses of a solar cell array (comprising a plurality of solar cell structural bodies electrically connected with each other) and resistivities of the concrete retaining body in each solar cell structural body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Here, for each of the solar cell structural bodies, the contact area S of the concrete retaining body with the conductor portion of the solar cell was made to be 849.2 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in order to make it possible to readily handle the solar cell structural body by one person. The maximum output voltage Vmp of the entire solar cell array (wherein leakage current is relatively liable to flow) was made to be 60 V. The maximum output current Imp of the solar cell in each solar cell structural body was made to be 4.5 A. For the concrete retaining body in each solar cell structural body, the thickness d thereof was made to be 8 cm, and the resistivity &rgr; thereof was varied in a range of 0 to 60&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is understood that when the resistivity of the concrete retaining body is less than about 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm (at a point indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>), the power loss P<highlight><subscript>loss </subscript></highlight>suddenly starts increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in terms of using the solar cell structural body, when the thickness of the concrete retaining body is made to be smaller than aforesaid value, the wind endurance strength of the solar cell structural body becomes insufficient. And when the maximum output voltage is made to be higher than aforesaid value, the electric security becomes difficult to be ensured. Therefore, it is considered that the solar cell structural body will be never used under worse condition than this. In this respect, as long as the resistivity of the concrete retaining body is more than 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm, it is possible to form an appropriate solar cell structural body without having a due care about the installation form. When the resistivity of the concrete retaining body is less than 120&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm, it is possible to form an appropriate solar cell structural body which can be ensured in terms of the wind endurance strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of the solar cell structural body of the present invention, having a solar cell arranged on a concrete retaining body formed from a mixture composed of a cement, an aggregate and water such that part of a conductor portion of said solar cell is contacted with said concrete retaining body. with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic view illustrating an example of the structure of a solar cell structural body of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> indicates a solar cell, reference numeral <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> a concrete retaining body, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> a concrete back face retaining body. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. two solar cells <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are arranged and fixed on the concrete retaining body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the concrete retaining body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is sloped by means of the concrete back face retaining body <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at an optimum inclination angle so that the light receiving face of each of the two solar cells can sufficiently receive irradiation of sunlight. as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (explanation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be made later). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the structure of the solar cell structural body shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conductor portion of the solar cell <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, namely an electrode portion and an electric connection portion at the back face of the solar cell are contacted with the surface of the concrete retaining body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating an example of the solar cell used in the solar cell structural body shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (corresponding to reference numeral <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) indicates a solar cell comprising a photovoltaic element <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. a positive electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a negative electrode <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and a weathering-resistant coat film <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (corresponding to reference numeral <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) indicates a concrete retaining body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The solar cell is arranged and fixed on the concrete retaining body as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. And as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the concrete retaining body is sloped by means of the concrete back face retaining body (<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>; see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) at an optimum inclination angle so that the light receiving face of the solar cell can sufficiently receive irradiation of sunlight so as to enable the solar cell to have an optimum power generation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> At this time, there would be a possibility that the conductor portions (the electrode portion and the electric connection portion) at the back face of the solar cell are contacted with the concrete retaining body (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>; see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and the power generated by the solar cell is leaked to the ground. However, by using a concrete retaining body having a resistivity of more than 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm as the concrete retaining body, it is possible to minimize occurrence of power loss. Separately, by adopting such installation manner as above described, the concrete retaining body (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) is contacted with the concrete back face retaining body (<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) &lsqb;which is contacted with the ground&rsqb; by way of line contact (see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and it is also contacted with the ground by way of line contact through a lower end portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Thus, the concrete retaining body is contacted with the ground at two positions, i.e., at a position of &lsqb;the concrete retaining body/the ground&rsqb; where the concrete retaining body is contacted with the ground by way of line contact and at a position of &lsqb;the concrete retaining body/the back face retaining body/the ground&rsqb; where the concrete retaining body is contacted with the back face retaining body by way of line contact. Therefore, the resistance value between the solar cell and the ground in this is greater than that in the case where the concrete retaining body is directly contacted with the surface of the ground by way of face-to-face contact, and therefore, the leakage current from the solar cell to the ground is diminished to minimize the power loss. </paragraph>

Then, on the back aide electrode layer <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, an a-Si semiconductor photoactive layer <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> having one or More semiconductor junctions by a plasma CVD method. Successively, on the a-Si semiconductor photoactive layer <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, an In<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>thin film as the transparent electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is formed by a resistance-heating evaporation method.

The concrete retaining body itself is heavy and therefore, only by placing the concrete retaining body on the surface of the ground, the arrangement thereof may be completed. In the case where the back face retaining body is used, only by arranging the concrete retaining body on the back face retaining body, the arrangement thereof may be completed. By doing in this way, it is possible to establish a solar cell structural body whose structure is simple and which excels in terms of the execution work efficiency. </paragraph>

The back face retaining body is not necessary to be used depending on the form of the concrete retaining body. To use the back face retaining body is advantageous in that when it is used as a sleeper member for the concrete retaining body shaped in a plate form, the inclination angle of the concrete retaining body can be freely changed by means of the sleeper member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The back face retaining body may be shaped in a rectangular parallelopiped form. The back face retaining body serves to retain the concrete retaining body and therefore, the back face retaining body is necessary to have a sufficient compressive strength such that the back face retaining body is hardly deformed even upon the application of a large load. In addition, the back face retaining body is preferred to have durability against environments outdoors. Thus, the back face retaining body is preferred to comprise a material which satisfies these requirements.

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> From the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it is understood that when the resistivity &rgr; of the concrete retaining body becomes to be less than 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm, the power loss is suddenly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a graph of concrete members prepared using a Portland cement as the concrete retaining body, exemplifying interrelations between resistivities of said concrete members after having dried in atmospheric air for one week and water cement ratios of said concrete members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> From the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is understood that the leakage current can be diminished by making the water cement ratio upon the preparation of a concrete member as the concrete retaining body to be about 40%. It is also understood that by air-drying the concrete member, the resistivity thereof is increased, and therefore, the leakage current can be more depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Separately, the structure adopted in this example is that the concrete retaining body is installed so as to incline by means of the back face retaining body, where the contact area of the concrete retaining body with the ground is markedly decreased and along with this, the resistance between the concrete retaining body and the ground is markedly increased. Because of this, the power loss of the power generated is more diminished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As above described, according to the solar cell structural body in this example, by using a concrete retaining body prepared so as to have a resistivity &rgr; of less than 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm. it is possible to diminish the power loss which is occurred due to a cause that the power generated by the solar cell is leaked to the ground through the concrete retaining body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Further, it is not necessary to use a member or the like in order to diminish the power loss and because of this, the work efficiency improved and the power generation efficiency improved. This results in a considerable reduction in the cost. Further. because the solar cell structural body a sufficient wind compressive strength, it is possible to cut fixtures and the like, where the work efficiency is improved, and the apparatus cost can be considerably reduced. Thus, it is possible to achieve a highly reliable solar cell structural body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As detailed in the above description, the present invention affords such significant advantages as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> (1) A typical embodiment of the solar cell structural body of the present invention has a solar cell arranged on a concrete retaining body comprising a concrete prepared from a mixture comprising at least a cement, water and an aggregate, such that part of a conductor portion of said solar cell is contacted with said concrete retaining body, characterized in that said concrete has a resistivity in a range of from 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 120&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm. In the solar cell structural body of the present invention, it is possible to diminish the quantity of the power generated by the solar cell which is leaked to the installation face from the conductor portion of the solar cell which is contacted with the surface of the concrete retaining body through the inside of the concrete retaining body, that is. the power loss of the power generated can be considerably diminished without depending on the installation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> (2) By making the water cement ratio upon the production of said concrete to be less than 40% in terms of a weight ratio, it is possible that the water content in the concrete is depressed and the resistivity thereof after hardened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> (3) By making the mixing ratio of the aggregate to the cement be at least 1:4 in terms of a weight ratio, it is possible that the water absorption coefficient of the concrete is decreased to reduce an influence of water to permeate into the concrete and to increase the resistivity of the concrete . In the case where sands are used as the aggregate, it is preferred to use sands whose chloride content is relatively small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> (4) When a Portland cement or an alumina cement is as the cement, the use method thereof is simple and readily practiced in order to produce a concrete member in a desired form. In addition, it is possible to produce a concrete which excels in strength and durability. Further, these cements are relatively inexpensive and therefore, it is possible to reduce the production cost when these cements are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> (5) The concrete is preferred to comprises a concrete hardened in atmospheric air. When the hardening is performed in water, the water content is increased. The hardening is preferred to perform in atmospheric air, where the water content is decreased to make it possible to increase the resistivity of the concrete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> (6) The concrete retaining body is capable of serving as a back face member of the solar cell or a trestle for the solar cell. When the solar cell is provided on the surface of the concrete retaining body. the solar cell itself is reinforced and the strength thereof is improved. Therefore, it is possible to considerably reduce reinforcing members and the like and it is possible to considerably reduce the production cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> (7) The concrete retaining body does not contain a reinforcement and because of this, the resistivity of the concrete retaining body is not decreased. This enables to diminish the power loss of the solar cell structural body. Thus, the cost of the solar cell structural body can be remarkably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> (8) The solar cell has two electrically conductive portions having a different polarity, one on the light receiving face side and the other on the non-light receiving face side and therefore, the solar cell is hardly short-circuited. Because of this, wiring works upon the installation can be smoothly performed. Therefore, the work efficiency is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> (9) When the density of the concrete retaining body is made to be d&lsqb;Kg/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;, the inclination angle of the retaining body from the ground face is made to be &thgr;, and the thickness of the retaining body is made to be t &lsqb;m&rsqb;, the relation equation: <highlight><italic>t&gt;</italic></highlight>1307.9(0.71&plus;0.016&times;&thgr;)/(<highlight><italic>d&times;g</italic></highlight>&times;cos &thgr;) is established. Thus, the concrete retaining body is not moved even upon blowing strong wind, and therefore, the solar cell structural body is highly reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> (10) The solar cell array of the present invention has a plurality of solar cell structural bodies of the present invention which are mutually connected in series and parallel connections and because of this, a desired power can be obtained depending on the connection method adopted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> (11) By electrically grounding the positive electrode terminal or the negative electrode terminal of the solar cell array, it is possible to make the control and protection apparatus and the like such that they are surely operated so as to prevent occurrence of leakage or/and abnormal voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> (12) The sunlight power generation system of the present invention having a connection body in which a plurality of solar cell structural bodies of the present invention are electrically connected and said connection body has a positive electrode terminal and a negative electrode terminal which are connected to an inverter having a ground sensor accommodated therein, and therefore, the power generated by the solar cell structural bodies can be efficiently outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> (13) Because, the ground current I<highlight><subscript>leak </subscript></highlight>of the solar cell structural body is less than 100 mA, in the case of the inverter, it is not stopped with the detection of said ground current (it is stopped at the time of more than 100 mA), and therefore, it is possible to prevent stoppage of the operation of the inverter. </paragraph>
