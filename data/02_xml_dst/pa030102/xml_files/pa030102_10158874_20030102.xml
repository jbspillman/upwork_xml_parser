<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an intramedullary nail </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An intramedullary pin of this type has been described in EP-A 0 551 588. Its particular shortcomings consist of the fact that the two hip screws which are inserted in the head of the femur (femur-head screw and hip pin) extend through the circular openings in the intramedullary fastening pin in angularly rigid fashion. Due to their dimensionally defined difference in flexural strength it is possible during the clinical process for these two screws to move relative to each other. The smaller hip pin, because of its limited or even inhibited gliding ability, can penetrate the hip joint. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an intramedullary nail for the treatment of femoral fractures, comprising a distal end for insertion in the medullary channel, a proximal end, a longitudinal axis, and defining a first borehole located adjacent the proximal end extending through the proximal end and horizontally intersecting the longitudinal axis. The first borehole is configured to accept a femoral head screw and defines a center line extending at an angle of between about 30&deg; to 70&deg; relative to the longitudinal axis. A second borehole is positioned between the first borehole and the proximal end and extends through the proximal end and horizontally intersects the longitudinal axis. The second borehole is configured to accept a hip pin and is at least in part elongated into a slot having a width B and a length L&gt;B, with the length L of the slot extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The fact that the slot-shaped, elongated hole eliminates the angular rigidity in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the hip pin presents no drawback compared to prior art, since any rotation of the femoral head around the femoral-head screw remains inhibited by the hip pin which, after all, is and always will be the purpose of the hip pin. The use of an elongated hole for accepting the hip pin offers an advantage insofar as it permits mechanical load distribution of the two hip screws. The larger one of the femoral head screws performs the function of ensuring angular rigidity of the screw anchored in the femoral head relative to the intramedullary fastening pin while permitting a &ldquo;sintering&rdquo; of the femoral head fragment through axial movement in the corresponding intramedullary fastening pin borehole. The smaller hip pin merely serves to secure the femoral head rotationally relative to the larger femoral bead screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form of implementation of this invention, the first borehole is cylindrically round. Preferably, the lateral entry opening of the second borehole is cylindrically round while the medial exit opening of the second borehole is preferably elongated into a slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another implementation both the lateral entry opening and the medial exit opening of the second borehole may be slot-shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The width B of the second borehole is preferably smaller than the diameter D of the first borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The center line of the first borehole preferably extends at an angle &agr; of 40&deg;-55&deg; relative to the longitudinal axis. The center line of the second borehole preferably extends at an angle &bgr; of 30&deg; to 70&deg; relative to the longitudinal axis or an angle 180&deg;-&bgr; from 110&deg; to 150&deg;. This is the preferred position for a non-moving anchoring screw. The angle &bgr; may equally well have a value of 70&deg; to 90&deg; for as long as the angle &agr; is within the same angular range. This is the preferred position for a moving hip screw. The length L of the elongated hole or slot is preferably 8 to 12 mm and typically 9 to 11 mm. The width B of the elongated hole is preferably 5 to 10 mm and typically 6 to 7 mm. The L:B ratio is preferably in the range from 1.05 to 2.00 and typically 1.10 to 1.60. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A preferred implementation additionally includes at least one third borehole near the distal end horizontally intersecting the longitudinal axis and serving to accept a distal locking screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another implementation the lateral entry opening of the second borehole may be slot-shaped while the medial exit opening of that second borehole is cylindrically round. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The hip pin to be used as part of a fixation system in conjunction with the intramedullary fastening pin should preferably be 5 to 20 mm and typically 10 to 15 mm shorter than the femoral head screw employed. The diameter of the hip pin should preferably correspond to the width B of the slot-shaped second borehole. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For convenience, the same or equivalent elements in the various embodiments of the invention illustrated in the drawings have been identified with the same reference numerals. Further, in the description that follows, any reference to either orientation or direction is intended primarily for the convenience of description and is not intended in any way to limit the scope of the present invention thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The intramedullary nail or intramedullary fastening pin <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, serving to stabilize femoral fractures, includes a distal end <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> intended for insertion in the medullary channel, a proximal end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Closer to its proximal end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and intersecting the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the fastening pin <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a first borehole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, having a longitudinal axis or center line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, designed to accept a hip screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The center line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the first cylindrically round borehole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> extends at an angle &agr; of 30&deg; to 70&deg; relative to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or an angle 180&deg;-&agr; of 110&deg; to 150&deg;. Additionally, the fastening pin <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided between the first borehole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the proximal end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a second borehole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, having a center line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, horizontally intersecting the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and serving to accept a hip pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The center line of the second borehole extends at an angle &bgr; of 45&deg; relative to the longitudinal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, both the lateral entry opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the medial exit opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the second borehole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are elongated slots. This design makes it possible for the hip pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is inserted in the borehole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the lateromedial plane (corresponding to the plane of projection in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to be slightly angled in both directions, i.e. up and down, relative to the axis <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In that case the hip pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> inserted in the borehole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be fully enclosed at the lateral entry opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, permitting limited movement only in the lateromedial plane (corresponding to the plane of projection in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) relative to the axis <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the elongated hole may have rounded corners (produced by drilling the hole with a round drill bit or cutter and moving the latter in a direction perpendicular to the tool axis), or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it may be rectangular with squared corners. Whether rounded or rectangular, the slot has the same width B and a length L&gt;B, with the length L of the slot extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The width B of the second borehole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is preferably smaller than the diameter D of the first borehole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The slot length is 10 mm, its width 6.5 mm, corresponding to a L:B ratio of 1.538. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the intramedullary fastening pin <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is additionally provided near its distal end <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a third borehole <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which horizontally intersects the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and serves to accept a distal locking screw <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is desirable for the hip pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, consisting of shank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and threaded front part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, to be 5 to 20 mm and preferably 10 to 15 mm shorter than the femoral head screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which latter consists of shank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and threaded front part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
