<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display and, more particularly, to a vertically aligned mode liquid crystal display where a pixel region is partitioned into a plurality of micro-domains to obtain a wide viewing angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a liquid crystal display (LCD) has a structure where a liquid crystal bearing dielectric anisotropy is sandwiched between a color filter substrate and a thin film transistor (TFT) array substrate. The color filter substrate has a common electrode, color filters and a black matrix, and the TFT array substrate has a TFT and a pixel electrode. An electric field is applied to the liquid crystal while being varied in strength, thereby controlling the light transmission and displaying the desired picture image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a LCD usually involves a narrow viewing angle. In order to obtain a wide viewing angle, various techniques have been developed. Among such techniques, it has been proposed that the liquid crystal molecules are vertically aligned with respect to the substrates while forming opening or protrusion patterns at the pixel electrode and the common electrode facing each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the opening pattern formation technique, an opening pattern is formed at the pixel electrode and the common electrode, respectively. Fringe fields are formed due to the opening patterns, and the inclining direction of the liquid crystal molecules is controlled by way of the fringe fields, thereby widening the viewing angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the protrusion formation technique, a protrusion is formed at the pixel electrode and the common electrode, respectively. The electric field formed between the pixel electrode and the common electrode is deformed due to the protrusions, thereby controlling the inclining direction of the liquid crystal molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also possible that an opening pattern is formed at the pixel electrode, while a protrusion is formed at the common electrode. Fringe fields are formed due to the opening pattern and the protrusion, and the inclining direction of the liquid crystal molecules is controlled by way of the fringe fields, thereby partitioning the pixel region into a plurality of micro-domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In such a multi-domain LCD, the contrast ratio-based viewing angle, or the gray scale inversion-based viewing angle is 80&deg; or more in all directions, which is an excellent result. The contrast ratio-based viewing angle takes a contrast ratio of 1:10 as a reference value, and the gray scale inversion-based viewing angle is defined as a limitation angle of inter-gray scale brightness inversion. However, the LCD bears side gamma curve deformation where the center gamma curve and the side gamma curve are not agreed upon, and hence, involves deteriorated visibility from the left and right sides even when compared to a twisted nematic (TN) LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For instance, in the case of a patterned vertically aligned (PVA) mode where an opening pattern is formed to obtain multiple domains, as the viewing angle becomes larger, the screen becomes brighter and the color becomes whiter. In an extreme case, the difference in distance between the bright gray scales is dissipated so that the picture image seems to be collapsed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As the LCD has been recently developed for use in a multi-media use, it is desirable that still or motion picture images should be displayed with enhanced visibility. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-domain LCD that provides excellent side visibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This and other objects may be achieved by a LCD where each pixel region is partitioned into upper and lower domains and left and right domains, and where the volume occupied by the upper and lower domains is established to be larger than the volume occupied by the left and right domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the LCD includes a first insulating substrate, and a first wiring line assembly formed on the first insulating substrate with a plurality of first wiring lines. A second wiring line assembly crosses over the first wiring line assembly with a plurality of second wiring lines while defining pixel regions. The second wiring line assembly is insulated from the first wiring line assembly. A pixel electrode is formed at each pixel region. A TFT is connected to the first wiring line assembly, the second wiring line assembly, and the pixel electrode. A second insulating substrate faces the first insulating substrate. A common electrode is formed on the second insulating substrate. A first domain partitioning member is formed at any one of the first and the second insulating substrates. A second domain partitioning member is formed at any one of the first and the second insulating substrates. The first and the second domain partitioning members partition the pixel region into a plurality of left and right domains and a plurality of upper and lower domains. The volume occupied by the upper and lower domains is established to be larger than the volume occupied by the left and right domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The volume occupied by the upper and lower domains may be established to be 60-90% of the entire pixel region, or 80% or more of the entire pixel region. An opening pattern is formed at the pixel electrode as the first domain partitioning member. An opening pattern or a protrusion pattern may be formed at the common electrode as the second domain partitioning member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The distance between the neighboring second wiring lines is repeatedly altered per a predetermined length, and both sides of the pixel electrode close to the wiring lines are patterned with the same outline as the wiring lines such that the pixel electrode has a narrow portion and a wide portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An opening pattern may be formed at the pixel electrode as the first domain partitioning member with first and second opening portions. The first opening portion partitions the narrow portion of the pixel electrode along the direction of the second wiring line, and the second opening portion partitions the wide portion of the pixel electrode along the direction of the first wiring line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A storage capacitor line assembly may cross over the second wiring line assembly while being insulated from the second wiring line assembly. The storage capacitor line assembly has first and second storage capacitor lines overlapped with the first and the second opening portions, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The upper and lower domains are classified into first and second upper and lower domains where the directors of liquid crystal molecules are inclined in different directions. The volume occupied by the first upper and lower domains is larger than the volume occupied by the second upper and lower domains.</paragraph>

In the drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one vertical opening portion <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and three horizontal opening portions <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are illustrated, but the number thereof may be altered at needs. However, the volume ratio of the left and right micro-domains to the upper and lower micro-domains is established to be 4:6-1:9 irrespective of the number of the opening portions <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Color filters <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of red, green and blue are formed on the black matrix <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at the pixel regions. A common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is formed on the color filters <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with a transparent conductive material. A protrusion pattern is formed on the common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with an organic material. The protrusion pattern is formed with vertical protrusions <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, and horizontal protrusions <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The organic material for the protrusion pattern has a dielectric anisotropy different from that of the liquid crystal material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> injected between the substrates. The protrusion pattern may be replaced by an opening pattern that is formed through patterning the common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In this case, an over-coat layer is preferably provided between the color filters <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> such that the color filters <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are not exposed through the opening pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The TFT array substrate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is combined with the color filter substrate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and a liquid crystal material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is injected between the substrates. The liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are oriented such that the directors thereof are vertically aligned with respect to the substrates <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with no application of an electric field between the pixel and the common electrodes <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are arranged such that the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is correctly overlapped with the corresponding color filter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In this structure, the pixel region is partitioned into a plurality of micro-domains by way of the opening pattern and the protrusion pattern. The micro-domains are classified into left and right domains A, and upper and lower domains B. When an electric field is applied between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the directors of the liquid crystal molecules at the left and right domains A are inclined in the left and right directions, and those at the upper and lower domains B in the upper and lower directions. The inclining directions of the directors of the liquid crystal molecules are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by way of arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The volume ratio of the upper and lower domains B to the left and right domains A is established to be 6/4-9/1. In this way, the viewing angle based on visibility can be widened. This will be now explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating the gamma curves at the center and at the <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&deg; side of a test cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As seen in the graph, the gamma curve at the center of the test cell proceeds above the gamma curve at the <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&deg; side of the test cell. Particularly, as the distance between the center gamma curve and the side gamma curve is very significant at the lower gray scales, the brightness difference of two to ten times or more is made depending upon whether the same gray scale is viewed from the center or from the side. As the respective gray scales of red, green and blue are altered in a separate manner, the deformation degree of the side gamma curve is differentiated at the pixels of red, green and blue. Therefore, the color sensation is differently made at the center and the side. For instance, as illustrated in the graph, assuming that the respective pixels of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) bear a gray scale of <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, respectively, when viewed from the center, the composition ratio of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) is as shown below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> R:G:B&equals;73:50:10&equals;55%:37%:8% </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> By contrast, when viewed from the 60&deg; side, the composition ratio of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) is as shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> R:G:B&equals;75:66:41&equals;41%:36%:23% </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the blue content is increased by three times or more compared to the former case so that an entirely different color is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As the gamma curve is deformed with the outline shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the low ratio color at the center becomes increased at the 60&deg; side, whereas the high ratio color at the center becomes decreased at the 60&deg; side. Accordingly, the color ratios of red, green and blue are approximated to each other. The colors that seem to be different when viewed from the center, but similar when viewed from the 60&deg; side, are totally reduced in chrominance, and shifted into white. This is called the &ldquo;white-shift.&rdquo; The white shift causes deterioration in color reproduction, and results in unclear picture images. This is because the gamma curve is seriously deformed at the lower gray scales. Even though such a gamma deformation is made at the higher gray scales, only a negligible variation is made. By contrast, in the case where the gamma deformation is made at the lower gray scales, the brightness becomes differentiated by two to ten times or more. Such a significant brightness differentiation causes occurrence of the white shift in a large scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the VT curves when a single-domain vertically aligned mode LCD cell is viewed in eight directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the phenomenon where the VT curve moves to the left at the lower gray scales appears significantly at the upper or lower side. The VT curve elevates at the left and right sides with the lower gray scales while making the same curve as with the center. The gray scale inversion is initially made at the left bottom and the right bottom. The VT curve again moves to the right while making an elevating curve. Accordingly, the phenomenon where the gamma curve is deformed upward at the lower gray scales becomes serious in the case where the direction of observing the LCD cell and the inclining direction of the liquid crystal molecules under the application of an electric field are the same, but weakens in the case where those directions perpendicular to each other. Therefore, in order to enhance the viewing angle based on the visibility at the left and right sides, the upper and lower domains, where the directors of the liquid crystal molecules are inclined in the upper and lower directions, should be enlarged as much as possible. Furthermore, in order to enhance the viewing angle based on the visibility at the upper and lower sides, the left and right domains, where the directors of the liquid crystal molecules are inclined in the left and in the right directions, should be enlarged as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a conceptual view illustrating the arrangement of the directors of the liquid crystal molecules at each pixel domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In order to enhance the viewing angle based on the visibility at the left and right sides, the volume occupied by the first and third domains should be reduced, while the volume occupied by the second and fourth domains should be enlarged. To the contrary, in order to enhance the viewing angle based on the visibility at the upper and lower sides, the volume occupied by the first and third domains should be enlarged, while the volume occupied by the second and fourth domains should be reduced. That is, the improvement in the viewing angle at the left and right sides, and the improvement in the viewing angle at the upper and lower sides are in an inverse relation to each other. However, when viewed from the standpoint of the user, the viewing angle at the left and right sides is more important than that at the upper and lower sides. Therefore, in this preferred embodiment, the volume of the second and fourth domains is increased, while the volume of the first and third domains is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> are graphs illustrating the side VT and gamma curves as a function of the occupation ratios of the upper and lower domains and the left and right domains when the pixel is viewed in the left and right directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As known from the graphs, the greater the volume of the upper and lower domains B at the pixel region is, the deformation of the gamma curve at the left and right sides becomes reduced. That is, all of the domains at a pixel region should be formed as the upper and lower domains B to maximize the visibility at the left and right sides. However, in the case where the left and right domains A are absent, the visibility in the upper and lower directions becomes seriously deteriorated. Therefore, it is preferable that the ratio of the upper and lower domains B should be established to be 60-90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> are graphs illustrating the deformation ratio of the side gamma curve to the center gamma curve as a function of the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> illustrates the case where the pixel region is viewed from the 40&deg; side, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> illustrates the case where the pixel region is viewed from the 60&deg; side. In both cases, the gamma curve deformation ratio of a 17-inch TN mode LCD is illustrated together for comparison. As the TN mode involves a single domain, the gamma deformation in the left and right directions is extremely small, but significantly large in the upper and lower directions. Therefore, in case only the left and right directions are taken in consideration, it follows that the visibility of the TN mode LCD is good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> that when the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B is 80% or more, the side visibility becomes better compared to the TN mode. The TN mode LCD is a practical panel, and the VA mode is a test cell. In consideration that the practical panel bears better performance characteristic compared to the test cell, the possibility of reduction in the deformation of the gamma curve is higher with the practical panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating the VT curves and the gamma curves in the diagonal direction (&oslash;&equals;45&deg;) in the case where the occupation ratios of the upper and lower domains B are 50% and 80%. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating the regions bearing good and bad visibility in the case where the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B becomes heightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the graph that the VT curves and the gamma curves where the occupation ratios of the upper and lower domains B are 50% and 80% are not differentiated from each other in the diagonal direction (&oslash;&equals;45&deg;). That is, the VT curve and the gamma curve are not influenced by the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B in the diagonal direction. Even though the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B becomes higher, the visibility in the diagonal direction is not enhanced. This is because the visibility in the upper and lower directions and the visibility in the left and right directions are in an inverse relation to each other, while the visibility in the diagonal direction is placed at the borderline area between them. That is, in case the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B is increased, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the visibility becomes enhanced in the range of &minus;45&deg;&lt;&oslash;&minus;45&deg;, but deteriorated in the range of 45&deg;&lt;&oslash;&lt;135&deg;. </paragraph>

The data line assembly includes data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> proceeding in the vertical direction. Each data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a plurality of linear portions with a large width arranged around an imaginative straight line left and right in an alternate manner, and connectors with a small width interconnecting the linear portions. The distance between the neighboring linear portions placed around the imaginative straight line left and right is controlled in consideration of the occupation ratios of the upper and lower domains and the left and right domains. In the two neighboring data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the corresponding linear portions are placed around the relevant imaginative straight lines left and right.

A pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is formed on the passivation layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> at each pixel region with indium tin oxide (ITO) or indium zinc oxide (IZO).

An overcoat layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is formed on the color filters <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and a common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is formed on the overcoat layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> with a transparent conductive material such as ITO and IZO. The common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> has an opening pattern similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>. That is, the common electrode <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> bears third opening portions <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> longitudinally extended in the vertical direction, and fourth and fifth opening portions <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> longitudinally extended in the horizontal direction.

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the LCD is made through combining the TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> such that they are spaced apart from each other with a predetermined distance. After a liquid crystal material is injected between the substrates <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the substrates <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are sealed together.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The third opening portions <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> are overlapped with the left and right boundaries of the narrow portion of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and the fourth opening portions <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are overlapped with the top and bottom boundaries of the wide portion of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The fifth opening portion <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is positioned at the place where the wide portion of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is bisected up and down. Therefore, the narrow portion of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is partitioned into two micro-domains by way of the first and the third opening portions <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The wide portion of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is partitioned into four micro-domains by way of the second opening portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and the fourth and fifth opening portions <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. The width of the micro-domain is preferably established to be 20&plusmn;5&square;. The width of the micro-domain is determined in consideration of the occupation ratios of the upper and lower domains B and of the left and right domains A. When the width of the micro-domain is too narrow, the opening ratio becomes deteriorated. By contrast, when the width of the micro-domain is too wide, fringe fields are formed so weak that it is not easy to control the inclining direction of the liquid crystal molecules. The occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B is higher than that of the left and right domains A. It is preferable that the occupation ratio of the upper and lower domains B to the entire pixel region should be established to be 60-90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With the formation of the above-structured pixel electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the opening pattern for domain partitioning, the opening ratio can be significantly enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the above-structured LCD, all of the micro-domains have a rectangular shape so that advantages are made with respect to the response speed, and minimization in the occurrence of texture at the edge of the micro-domain. </paragraph>

The micro-domains A, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are classified into left and right domains A and upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Under the application of an electric field between the pixel and the common electrodes <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the directors of the liquid crystal molecules are inclined in the left and right directions at the left and right domains A, and inclined in the upper and lower directions at the upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in turn classified into first upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and second upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The first upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> bear a width narrower than the second upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Under the application of an electric field, the inclining direction of the liquid crystal molecules at the first upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is opposite to that of the liquid crystal molecules at the second upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The inclining directions of the directors of the liquid crystal molecules are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> by way of arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> That is, in this preferred embodiment, the occupation ratios of the first and second upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are controlled through differentiating the domain width. Alternatively, the occupation ratios of the first and second upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be controlled through differentiating the number of domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As described above, the occupation ratios of the first and second domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are controlled in a different manner so that the left and right visibility can be improved while securing either the upper visibility or the lower visibility by a predetermined degree. As the upper visibility is more important that the lower visibility for the display use, the occupation ratios of the first and second upper and lower domains B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are preferably controlled such that the upper visibility can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In order to make domain partitioning, an opening pattern is formed with or without a protrusion pattern. Alternatively, only a protrusion pattern may be formed to make the domain partitioning. That is, the above structure may be applied for use in any LCD where a pixel region is partitioned into a plurality of micro-domains, thereby obtaining wide viewing angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the multi-domain LCD, the occupation ratios of the upper and lower domains as well as the left and right domains are differentiated so that the visibility in the target direction can be enhanced. </paragraph>
