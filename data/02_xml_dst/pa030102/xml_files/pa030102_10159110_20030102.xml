<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a cleaning device and an image forming apparatus using the same and more particularly to a structure for cleaning an image carrier included in an image forming apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An electrophotographic process is one of conventional processes available for forming an image corresponding to a document or image information and disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 2,297,091 and Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 49-23910 and 43-24748. It is a common practice with the electrophotographic process to use an image carrier having a photoconductive layer. The photoconductive layer is exposed imagewise or scanned by a light beam to form a latent image representative of a document or image information. In the case of development using dry toner, the latent image is developed by the dry toner to become a toner image. The toner image is transferred to a sheet or recording medium and then fixed thereon by, e.g., heat and pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Developing devices are generally classified into a wet-process developing device and a dry-process developing device. The wet-process developing device uses a developing liquid consisting of an insulative, organic liquid and various kinds of pigments and dyes finely dispersed in the liquid. The dry-process developing device uses a developer implemented as dry toner consisting of natural or synthetic resin and carbon black or similar colorant dispersed in the resin. The dry-process developing device develops a latent image by using any one of a cascade method, a magnet brush method, a powder cloud method and other conventional methods. The developer for the dry-process developing device is either one of toner only and a toner and carrier mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Today, to meet the increasing demand for higher image quality, the grain size of toner for development is decreasing. Particularly, when a latent image is formed in the form of dots by digital processing, toner with a small grain size is often used to enhance reproducibility and sharpness. Toner with a small grain size is taught in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 1-112253, 2-284158 and 7-295283. These documents describe the mean grain sizes of toner and the amounts of toner grains having a mean grain size of 5 &mgr;m or below as well as the distributions of such toner grains specifically. The mean grain size of 5 &mgr;m or below is essential for high definition, high resolution images. Such toner grains faithfully deposit on a latent image without blurring or otherwise disfiguring it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An edge effect, which is one of problems particular to image formation, is conspicuous when toner with a mean grain size of 5 &mgr;m or below, but can be obviated if the toner contains a particular number percent of grains having grain sizes of 5 &mgr;m and above. Therefore, when use is made of toner with a mean grain size of 5 &mgr;m or below and containing 60 number percent to 80 number percent of grains with a grain size of 5 &mgr;m or above, high definition and high resolution are achievable. Such toner, however, is apt to bring about defective cleaning, as will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, after a toner image formed by toner on an image carrier has been transferred to a sheet, the surface of the image carrier is cleaned to remove toner left on the image carrier. One of conventional cleaning devices uses a cleaning blade pressed against the surface of the image carrier for scraping off the residual toner. This type of cleaning device, however, cannot adequately remove the residual toner and makes images defective when use is made of toner with a small grain size for the following reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Toner for development contains not only resin, which is the major component, but also various additives for different purposes. Likewise, sheets contain various additives. Although such additives each are effective for a particular purpose, they are separated from the toner and sheets due to repeated image formation and deposit on the image carrier. It is difficult for the cleaning blade to fully remove the additives, which are fine grains, so that toner with a small grain size accumulates on the surface of the image carrier little by little. This part of the toner is blocked by the fine grains of additives and cannot be easily scraped off despite the action of the cleaning blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The toner accumulated on the toner grains left on the drum eventually form masses that do not transmit light in an expected manner. Consequently, stains intermittently appear on the background or the white portion of an image and therefore appear in the resulting toner image in the form of a black stripe, making the toner image defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another problem with toner with a small grain size is that the amount of charge to deposit on the individual toner grain increases, increasing adhesion acting between the toner and the image carrier. This makes it difficult for the cleaning blade to block the toner grains and thereby causes the toner grains moved away from the cleaning blade to form black stripes in the background of an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Technologies relating to the present invention are also disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 6-138798 and 9-50215, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 7-33260, and Japanese Patent No. 3,155,421. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a cleaning device capable of surely removing additives separated from toner and sheets from an image carrier to thereby obviate defective images, and an image forming apparatus using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an image forming apparatus, after the development of a latent image formed on an image carrier effected by using toner, which has a volume mean grain size of 5 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m and in which 60 number percent to 80 number percent of toner grains have a grain size of 5 &mgr;m or below, and the transfer of the resulting image to a recording medium, a cleaning device of the present invention removes the toner left on the image carrier with a fur brush. The fur brush is capable of contacting the surface of the image carrier with density high enough to block the toner grains having the above grain size.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To better understand the present invention, the problem with the conventional cleaning system of the type using a cleaning blade will be described more specifically. A cleaning blade pressed against a photoconductive element cannot sufficiently remove toner having a small grain size and makes images defective, as stated earlier. This is because various additives added to toner and sheets are too small in grain size to be fully removed by the cleaning blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a cleaning blade B held in contact with the surface of a photoconductive drum A. As shown, assume that the cleaning blade F fails to remove toner grains T from the drum A, and that fine grains P of additives are separated from the toner T and sheets. Then, toner grains T with a small grain size is apt to accumulate around the above toner T and fine grains P. The toner grains accumulated are blocked by the fine grains P and cannot be fully scraped off despite the action of the cleaning blade B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Toner grains accumulate on the toner grains left on the drum A little by little due to repeated image formation and eventually form masses, which do not transmit light in an expected manner. Consequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, stains D intermittently appear on the background or the white portion of an image at intervals a in the circumferential direction of the drum A. The stains appear in the resulting toner image in the form of a black stripe and make the toner image defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an image forming apparatus including a cleaning device embodying the present invention will be described. While the following description will concentrate on a copier of the type forming a latent image on an image carrier with a light beam, the present invention is, of course, similarly applicable to any other image forming apparatus, e.g., a printer or a facsimile apparatus. As shown, the copier, generally <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, includes a photoconductive drum or image carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Arranged around the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are a charger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an optical writing unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a developing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a cleaning device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for executing an image forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, the developing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> stores a developer implemented as toner having volume mean grain sizes of 5 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m and in which 60 number % to 80 number % of toner grains have a grain size of 5 &mgr;m or below. The toner consists of resin and a colorant and may additionally contain wax and inorganic fine grains. The toner may be produced by either one of pulverization and polymerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> All resins known in the art are applicable to the resin and include styrene, poly-&agr;-stylstyrene, styrene-chlorostyrene copolymer, styrene-propylene copolymer, styrene-butadien copolymer, styrene-vinyl chloride copolymer, styrene-vinyl acetate copolymer, styrene-maleic acid copolymer, styrene-acrylate copolymer, styrene-methacrylate copolymer, styrene-&agr;-chloromethyl acrylate, styrene-achrilonitrile-acrylate copolymer and other styrene resins (polymers or copolymers containing styrene or styrene substitutes), polyester resin, epoxy resin, vinyl chloride resin, rosin modified, maleic acid resin, phenol resin, polyethylene resin, ketone resin, ethylene-ethylacrylate copolymer, xylene resin, and polyvinyl butyrate resin. Two or more of such resins may be used in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While the colorant is open to choice, use may be made of carbon black, Lamp Black, Iron Black, Ultramarine, Nigrosine Blue, Aniline Blue, Oil Black or Azooil Black by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The wax may be implemented by any one of conventional waxes including carnauba wax, rice wax and synthetic ester wax. As for inorganic fine grains, use may be made of the powder of silica or titanium oxide by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a relation between the weight percent and number percent of toner with respect to the distribution of volume mean grain sizes. In the illustrative embodiment, the developer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> uses toner having a volume mean grain size of 5 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m and in which 60 number percent to 80 number percent of toner gains have grain sizes of 5 &mgr;m or below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Experiments were conducted with the toner having the above volume mean grain size and content in order to determine reproducibility of line images. The line images respectively had 2 lines, 2.2 lines, 2.5 lines, 2.8 lines, 3.2 lines 3.6 lines, 4.0 lines 4 lines, 5 lines, 5.0 lines, 5.6 lines 6.3 lines and 7.2 lines arranged at equal intervals for 1 mm vertically and horizontally. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the results of experiments. As shown, the toner with the particular volume mean grain size and particular content stated above realizes high definition, high resolution images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the cleaning device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in detail. As shown, the cleaning device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A accommodating a cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B and a cleaning blade <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. The cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B and cleaning blade <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C are respectively positioned upstream and downstream of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the direction of rotation of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose configuration will be described later specifically is provided on the surface of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. The cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B is rotatable such that the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves in a direction counter to the direction of movement of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in contact with the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made up of a base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and loop-like filaments implanted in the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wrapped around a core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> included in the cleaning roller B. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</cross-reference>, in the illustrative embodiment, the filaments are implanted in the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a direction coincident with an angle &thgr; at which the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wrapped around the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Further, the filaments are implanted densely enough to obstruct even toner grains of small grain sizes. More specifically, in the illustrative embodiment, the filaments are implanted in a density of 300 loops for a square inch or above. The filaments are formed of a material chargeable to the same polarity as the toner by friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wrapped around the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such that the piles of the loops of the filaments are substantially parallel to the axis of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, the piles have a length and a diameter selected such that the ends of the filaments opposite to the implanted ends become substantially parallel to the axis of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when contacting the surface of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The material of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an electric resistance of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>&OHgr; or below and connected to ground. During image formation, a voltage opposite in polarity to the toner is applied between the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the filaments of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are implanted in the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the direction in which the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wrapped around the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wrapped around the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the filaments of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inclined relative to the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the angle &thgr; taken into account beforehand align in parallel to the axis of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> held in contact with the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> moves in the direction counter to the direction of movement of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as seen at the position where they contact each other. Further, the ends of the filaments contacting the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are substantially parallel to the axis of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and therefore contact the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> perpendicularly to the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This increases the area over which the individual filament contacts the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This, coupled with the fact that nearby filaments are positioned close enough to block toner grains, allows the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to contact the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> substantially continuously in the axial direction of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which moves in the direction counter to the direction of movement of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, rubs the surface of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a frictional force based on a difference in linear velocity. In addition, the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constantly pressed against the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> due to the bending rigidity of the filaments. The fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can therefore remove all of the small toner grains and small additive grains separated from sheets from the surface of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Particularly, because the filaments continuously rub the surface of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> due to the rotation of the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, they can rub any portion of above surface a plurality of times if the rotation speed of the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is adjusted, efficiently removing the impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is implanted in a particular density and provided with a particular electric characteristic, i.e., chargeable to the same polarity as the toner by friction and provided with an electric resistance of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>&OHgr;, as stated earlier. Under these conditions, a voltage opposite in polarity to the toner is applied to the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during image formation, allowing the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to scrape off the toner and additives separated from sheets without fail. Further, even when the amount of charge to deposit on the toner tends to increases due to the decrease in grain size, the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can reduce the amount of charge and remove the charge left on the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after image transfer. This successfully promotes the separation of the toner from the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for thereby increasing the scraping efficiency of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> I experimentally determined a relation between the density and electric resistance of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and defective images, i.e., intermittent stains shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> and black stripes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> show the results of experiments. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> indicate, defective images can be reduced if the density and electric characteristic of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are adequately selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> contacts the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then hits against a flicker bar <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>D disposed in the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A when the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is in rotation, so that the impurities between the filaments are removed. Further, a seal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>E is positioned in the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A upstream of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the direction of rotation of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, preventing the impurities removed by the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from leaking out of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A. A screw <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>E is disposed in the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A for conveying the toner removed from the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the developing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Even when the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fails to remove some impurities from the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the cleaning blade <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C scrapes them off. Therefore, the surface of the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> moved away from the cleaning device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is substantially free from impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, the height or length of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> above the base cloth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> maybe reduced to increases the elasticity and therefore the scraping ability of the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The elasticity relates to the bending rigidity of the bur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mentioned earlier and is directed toward higher scraping efficiency based on higher contact pressure between the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the drum <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> show the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B of the illustrative embodiment while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> show a conventional cleaning roller in which straight filaments are implanted. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, the fur brush <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has piles implemented by the piles of loop-like filaments and protruding from the core <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to a height lower than the height of the straight filaments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>. It is to be noted that the above height refers to a difference between the brush diameter D and the core diameter d. The configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> increases the bending rigidity of the piles to thereby cause the piles to fall down little when the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B is in rotation. It follows that the scraping force based on the rotation torque of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B is intensified for enhancing efficient removal of the impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In summary, it will be seen that the present invention provides a cleaning device capable of surely, efficiently removing impurities, i.e., toner and additives from the surface of an image carrier to thereby obviate defective images ascribable to the impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof. </paragraph>
