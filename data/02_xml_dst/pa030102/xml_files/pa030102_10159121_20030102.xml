<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Before starting the regular display in a liquid crystal display device of the bend alignment type, it is necessary to transition all the pixel regions in the entire display portion uniformly from splay alignment into bend alignment. However, conventionally, when applying a simple ac voltage, the transition sometimes does not take place, and when it does take place, the transition time is very long, and display defects due to alignment defects tend to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">In the method for driving a liquid crystal display device with OCB cells according to the present invention, a step of applying between an electrode <highlight><bold>22 </bold></highlight>and a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>23 </bold></highlight>an ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage, and a step of applying zero voltage or a low voltage to the substrates are repeated in alternation preceding the begin of the regular display operation and the regular display operation is carried out after all pixels have transitioned into bend alignment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an OCB-mode liquid crystal display device with fast response and broad viewing angle for displaying TV images, personal computer or multimedia images, a manufacturing method for the same, and a driving method for a liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional liquid crystal display devices employ, as one example of liquid crystal display modes, twisted nematic (TN) mode liquid crystal display elements using a nematic liquid crystal with positive dielectric anisotropy, but these have the shortcomings of a slow response and narrow viewing angles. There are also display modes with slow response and broad viewing angles, using a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) or anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, but these have shortcomings with regard to burn-in, shock resistance, and temperature dependence. There is also the in-plane switching (IPS) mode which has extremely broad viewing angles, in which the liquid crystal molecules are driven within the display plane by a transversal electric field, but the response times are slow, and numerical aperture and luminance are low. When trying to display full-color moving images on large screens, a liquid crystal mode with broad viewing angle, high luminance and fast display properties is necessary, but at present, a liquid crystal display mode that perfectly satisfies all these requirements in practice does not exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Among the conventional liquid crystal display devices that aimed for at least a broad viewing angle and high luminance are liquid crystal display devices in which TN mode liquid crystal regions are partitioned into two domains to widen the viewing angle vertically (see SID 92 DIGEST p.798-801). That is to say, using a nematic liquid crystal with positive dielectric anisotropy in the display pixels of the liquid crystal display device, two TN mode liquid crystal regions with different alignment orientation of the liquid crystal molecules are formed, and the viewing angle is enlarged by this TN-mode with two alignment domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of such a conventional liquid crystal display device. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, numerals <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> denote glass substrates, numerals <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> denote electrodes, and numerals <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>&prime; denote alignment films. In the alignment region A, the nematic liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>&prime; with positive dielectric anisotropy are slightly tilted away from the upper and lower boundaries to the opposing substrates, forming a larger and a smaller pretilt angle, whereas in the other alignment region B, the size of the pretilt angles with respect to the upper and lower boundaries of the opposing substrates is opposite to that in the alignment region A. Both the larger and the smaller pretilt angles are several degrees each, and are set to different angles. An example of a conventional manufacturing method for forming alignment regions with different pretilt angles at the upper and lower substrates is spreading photoresist on an alignment film, masking the photoresist photolithographically, and rubbing the desired alignment film surface in a predetermined direction, and repeating this procedure a certain number of times. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with this configuration, the liquid crystal molecules in the central portions of the liquid crystal layer in the alignment regions A and B are provided with opposite orientations, and since the liquid crystal molecules of the alignment regions rise in different directions when a voltage is applied, the refractive index anisotropy with respect to incoming light evens out for each pixel, and the viewing angle can be enlarged. With this conventional TN-mode with two alignment domains, the viewing angle can be made wider than with regular TN-mode, and the vertical viewing angle becomes about &plusmn;35&deg; at a contrast of 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the response time is substantially the same as in TN-mode, namely about 50 ms. Thus., in this conventional TN-mode with two alignment domains, viewing angle and response are insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As for liquid crystal display modes utilizing the so-called homeotropic alignment mode, in which the liquid crystal molecules are aligned approximately vertically at the boundaries to the alignment films, there are liquid crystal display devices with broad viewing angle and fast response that are provided with film phase&mdash;difference plates and subjected to alignment partitioning, but again the response time between black and white display is about 25 ms, and in particular the response time for gray scales is slow at 50-80 ms, which is longer than the {fraction (1/30)}s that are held to be the visual speed of the human eye, so that moving images appear blurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a bend alignment type liquid crystal display device (OCB-mode liquid crystal display device) has been proposed, which utilizes changes of the refractive index due to changes in the angle with which the liquid crystal molecules rise when the liquid crystal molecules between the substrates are in bend alignment. The speed with which the orientation of bend aligned liquid crystal molecules changes in the ON state and the OFF state is much faster than the speed of orientation changes between ON and OFF states in TN liquid crystal display devices, so that a liquid crystal display device with fast response time can be obtained. Moreover, in this bend alignment type liquid crystal display device, optical phase differences can be compensated automatically, because all the liquid crystal molecules are bend aligned between the upper and lower substrates, and the liquid crystal display device has potential as a liquid crystal display device with low voltage and broad viewing angle, because phase differences are compensated by the film phase difference plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, these liquid crystal display devices are manufactured such that the liquid crystal molecules between the substrates are in splay alignment when no voltage is applied. In order to change the refractive index using bend alignment, the entire display portion has to be transitioned uniformly from splay alignment to bend alignment before use of the liquid crystal display device. When applying a voltage between the opposing display electrodes, the transition seeds for the transition from splay alignment to bend alignment do not appear in uniform distribution, but around the distributed spacers, at alignment irregularities at the boundary to the alignment films, or at damaged portions. Furthermore, the transition seeds do not necessarily appear always at the same locations, which may easily lead to display defects, in which the transition sometimes takes place and sometimes does not take place. Consequently, it is very important that at least all pixel portions of the entire display portion are transitioned uniformly from splay alignment to bend alignment before use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, conventionally, when applying a simple ac voltage, the transition sometimes does not take place, and when it does take place, the transition time is very long. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention bend alignment type liquid crystal display device with fast response, suitable for display of moving images and broad viewing angle, in which the transition into bend alignment takes place reliably, and the transition is concluded in short time so that there are no display defects, as well as a manufacturing method for such a liquid crystal display device, and a driving method for a liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To achieve this object, according to a first aspect of the invention, a method for driving a liquid crystal display device, for an alignment transition from splay alignment to bend alignment in a liquid crystal display device which includes a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the substrates; wherein, when no voltage is applied, pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at an upper and at a lower boundary of the liquid crystal layer have opposite signs, and the liquid crystal layer is in splay alignment, having been subjected to a parallel alignment process; wherein, before liquid crystal display driving, an initialization process is performed, in which the alignment of the liquid crystal layer is transitioned from splay alignment to bend alignment by application of a voltage to the substrates; and wherein the liquid crystal display driving is performed in the bend alignment attained by this initialization; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> includes applying to the substrates an ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage to cause transition of the liquid crystal layer into bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With this method, an ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage is applied between the substrates, which makes the transition time shorter than when only an ac voltage is applied. The reason for this is that, superimposing a bias voltage has the effect that the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer is disturbed by the bias voltage, and the liquid crystal molecules lean toward one of the substrates. Thus, transition seeds appear within a short time and reliably in the liquid crystal layer, and the transition time is shortened. In addition, the transition time be made even shorter by increasing the effective voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the invention, a driving method for an alignment transition from splay alignment to bend alignment in a liquid crystal display device which includes a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the substrates; wherein, when no voltage is applied, pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at an upper and at a lower boundary of the liquid crystal layer have opposite signs, and the liquid crystal layer is in splay alignment, having been subjected to a parallel alignment process; wherein, before liquid crystal display driving, an initialization process is performed, in which the alignment of the liquid crystal layer is transitioned from splay alignment to bend alignment by application of a voltage to the substrates; and wherein the liquid crystal display driving is performed in the bend alignment attained by this initialization; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> includes a step of applying to the substrates an ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage, and a step of putting the substrates into an electrically released state, repeated in alternation so as to cause transition of the liquid crystal layer into bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This configuration includes providing a period of an electrically released state after the application of the ac voltage, which has the effect that the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer is disturbed, and the liquid crystal molecules lean toward one of the substrates. Thus, transition seeds appear within a short time and reliably in the liquid crystal layer, and the transition time is shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the invention, a driving method for an alignment transition from splay alignment to bend alignment in a liquid crystal display device which includes a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the substrates; wherein, when no voltage is applied, pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at an upper and at a lower boundary of the liquid crystal layer have opposite signs, and the liquid crystal layer is in splay alignment, having been subjected to a parallel alignment process; wherein, before liquid crystal display driving, an initialization process is performed, in which the alignment of the liquid crystal layer is transitioned from splay alignment to bend alignment by application of a voltage to the substrates; and wherein the liquid crystal display driving is performed in the bend alignment attained by this initialization; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> includes a step of applying to the substrates an ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage, and a step of applying zero voltage or a low voltage to the substrates, repeated in alternation so as to cause transition of the liquid crystal layer into bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This configuration includes a zero voltage or a low voltage application period after the application of the ac voltage, so that the effect of disturbing the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer is larger than in the second aspect of the present invention. Consequently, the effect that the liquid crystal molecules lean toward one of the substrates occurs in very little time. Thus, and the transition time becomes even shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to a fourth aspect of the invention, in a method for driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the third aspect, the ac voltage superimposed with the bias voltage is replaced with a dc voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, also when a dc voltage is applied instead of the ac voltage, there are periods in which zero voltage of a low voltage are applied after the application of this dc voltage, which cause disturbances of the liquid crystal alignment in the liquid crystal layer. Thus, the transition time can be shortened with this driving method, too. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to a fifth aspect of the invention, in a method for driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the second aspect, the frequency of the voltage repeated in alternation is in the range of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz, and the duty ratio of the voltage repeated in alternation is in the range of at least 1:1 to 1000:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Here, &ldquo;voltage repeated in alternation&rdquo; is the voltage when the repetition of the ac voltage application period and the period of the electrically released that as a whole is taken as one voltage pattern. The following are the reasons for the limitation of the frequency and the duty of the voltage repeated in alternation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the frequency is smaller than 0.1 Hz, then there is almost no alternating repetition, so that the tilting of the liquid crystal molecule alignment caused by this alternating repetition stops. On the other hand, when the frequency is larger than 100 Hz, then the rate of the alternating repetition is too high and approximates an ac voltage, so that the tilting of the liquid crystal molecule alignment caused by this alternating repetition stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When the duty ratio of the repeatedly applied voltage is smaller than 1:1 (for example, 1:5), then the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer is not sufficient. When the duty ratio is larger than 1000:1, then there is almost no alternated repetition, and the voltage is almost a dc voltage, so that the tilting of the liquid crystal molecule alignment caused by this alternating repetition stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to a sixth aspect of the invention, in a method for driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the third aspect, the frequency of the voltage repeated in alternation is in the range of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz, and the duty ratio of the voltage repeated in alternation is in the range of at least 1:1 to 1000:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The reasons for these limitations of the frequency and the duty ratio of the voltage repeated in alternation are the same as in the sixth aspect of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to a seventh aspect of the invention, in a method for driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the first aspect, the liquid crystal display device is an active matrix liquid crystal display device, and wherein the ac voltage is applied between a pixel electrode of the active matrix liquid crystal display device that is coupled to a switching element formed on one of the substrates and a common electrode formed on the other substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, it is possible to reduce the voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to a thirteenth aspect of the invention, in a method for driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the fourth aspect, the value of the ac voltage is set to a critical voltage that is a minimum voltage necessary for transitioning the liquid crystal layer from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, it is possible to reduce the voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to a fourteenth aspect of the invention, in a method for driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the third aspect, the voltage is an alternated voltage averaging over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, deterioration of the liquid crystal can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to a fifteenth aspect of the invention, a liquid crystal display device including a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the substrates; wherein, when no voltage is applied, pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at an upper and at a lower boundary of the liquid crystal layer have opposite signs, and the liquid crystal layer is in splay alignment, having been subjected to a parallel alignment process; wherein, before liquid crystal display driving, an initialization process is performed, in which the alignment of the liquid crystal layer is transitioned from splay alignment to bend alignment by application of a voltage to the substrates; wherein the liquid crystal display driving is performed in the bend alignment attained by the initialization; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> including a voltage application means for applying to the substrates an ac voltage or a dc voltage superimposed with a bias voltage, so as to transition the liquid crystal layer from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, a liquid crystal display device with short transition time is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to a sixteenth aspect of the invention, in a liquid crystal display device as in the fifteenth aspect, the value of the ac voltage or dc voltage is set to a critical voltage that is a minimum voltage necessary for transitioning the liquid crystal layer from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, a liquid crystal display device with short transition time is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to a seventeenth aspect of the invention, an active matrix liquid crystal display device including an array substrate provided with a pixel electrode; an opposing substrate provided with a common electrode; and a liquid crystal layer arranged between the array substrate and the opposing substrate; wherein pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at an upper and at a lower boundary of liquid crystal layer have opposite signs, and in a liquid crystal cell in splay alignment, which has been subjected to a parallel alignment process, the liquid crystal is in splay alignment when no voltage is applied; wherein, before liquid crystal display driving, an initialization process is performed, in which the alignment of the liquid crystal layer is transitioned from splay alignment to bend alignment by application of a voltage; wherein the liquid crystal display driving is performed in the bend alignment attained by the initialization; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> a liquid crystal cell including at least a first liquid crystal cell region, wherein a liquid crystal pretilt angle at an alignment film formed on an inner side of the array substrate is a first pretilt angle, and wherein a liquid crystal pretilt angle at an alignment film formed on an inner side of the opposing substrate is a second pretilt angle larger than the first pretilt angle; and a second liquid crystal cell region arranged next to the first liquid crystal cell region within the same pixel; wherein a liquid crystal pretilt angle at an alignment film formed on an inner side of the array substrate is a third pretilt angle, and wherein a liquid crystal pretilt angle at an alignment film formed on an inner side of the opposing substrate is a fourth pretilt angle larger than the third pretilt angle, the alignment films having been subjected to an alignment process directed from the first liquid crystal cell region to the second liquid crystal cell region; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> a first voltage application means for applying a first voltage between the pixel electrode and the common electrode so as to form a disclination line at a border between the first liquid crystal cell region and the second liquid crystal cell region; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> a second voltage application means for creating transition seeds at the disclination line by applying a second voltage larger than the first voltage between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, and causing transition from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, applying a first voltage between the pixel electrode and the common electrode forms a disclination line between the first liquid crystal cell region and the second liquid crystal cell region, where the bending energy is higher than around it, and applying a second voltage larger than the first voltage between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, directs even more energy to this disclination line, causing transition from splay alignment to bend alignment at the disclination line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in a liquid crystal display device with this configuration, the splay&mdash;bend alignment transition occurs reliably at a certain location (namely at the disclination lines) within the pixel regions provided with many liquid crystal cells, a reliable and fast alignment transition can be ensured, and a high-quality and inexpensive liquid crystal display device without display defects can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> According to an eighteenth aspect of the invention, in a liquid crystal display device as in the seventeenth aspect, the first and the fourth pretilt angles are at most 3&deg;, and the second and third pretilt angles are at least 4&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, the ratio between the second and the fourth pretilt angle, and the ratio between the first and the fourth pretilt angle can be large, so that disclination lines with a bending energy that is even higher than the bending energy around them can be formed, and the transition time from splay alignment to bend alignment can be made even shorter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, a transversal electric field is applied from the transversal electric field application portions in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer, so that this transversal electric field exerts a twisting force on the liquid crystal molecules, and consequently, transition seeds appear at the disclination line, and a quick alignment transition from splay alignment to bend alignment can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> According to a twentieth aspect of the invention, in a liquid crystal display device as in the seventeenth aspect, the direction in which the alignment films are subjected to the alignment process is slightly askew to a direction perpendicular to signal electrode lines or gate electrode lines arranged along the pixel electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Making the direction in which the alignment films are subjected to the alignment process is slightly askew to a direction perpendicular to signal electrode lines or gate electrode lines arranged along the pixel electrode, a slightly askew transversal electric field is applied to the disclination lines from the signal electrode lines or gate electrode lines, so that the twisting force on the splay aligned liquid crystal molecules is increased, thereby assisting the transition to bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to a twenty-first aspect of the invention, in a liquid crystal display device as in the seventeenth aspect, the second voltage is pulse-shaped with a frequency in the range of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz, and a duty ratio in the range of at least 1:1 to 1000:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Applying such a pulse-shaped second voltage and alternating voltage application periods and periods in which no voltage is applied, the liquid crystal molecules are disturbed and transition more readily, so that the splay aligned liquid crystal molecules transition into bend alignment. Frequency and duty ratio are limited to the above ranges to enlarge the transition regions of transition from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The regions of the disclination lines have a bending energy that is higher than in the regions around them, and in this situation, the transversal electric field is applied to the disclination lines from the gate electrode lines, which are arranged transversally with respect to the pixel electrodes, so that even more energy is directed to them, and the transition from splay alignment to bend alignment is accelerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to a twenty-third aspect of the invention, a liquid crystal display device as in the seventeenth aspect further includes a liquid crystal cell that has been alignment partitioned by irradiating UV light on a portion of at least one of the alignment films formed on the inner sides of the pixel electrode and the common electrode so that the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal at that alignment film is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Irradiating UV light on a portion of the alignment films, it is possible to modify the surface of the irradiated region of the alignment films, and to decrease the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal in the modified alignment films. The reasons why the pretilt angle in the alignment films are decreased by irradiation with UV light are not entirely clear at present, but it seems that the UV light breaks up side chains in the alignment surface. Thus, liquid crystal cells with alignment partitions can be formed by irradiation with UV light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> According to a twenty-fourth aspect of the invention, a liquid crystal display device as in the seventeenth aspect further includes a liquid crystal cell that has been alignment partitioned by irradiating a portion of the pixel electrode and a portion of the common electrode with UV light under an ozone atmosphere to flatten at least one of the portions of the pixel electrode and the common electrode has been flattened, and applying and baking an alignment film on the pixel electrode and the common electrode, so as to change the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal at the alignment film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Irradiating a portion of the pixel electrode and a portion of the common electrode with UV light under an ozone atmosphere, the surfaces of the pixel electrode and the common electrode can be flattened, and consequently, liquid crystal cells with alignment partitions and varying pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at the alignment films can be formed by spreading the alignment films on the pixel electrode and the common electrode. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> a preparation step of preparing a liquid crystal cell in splay alignment, which has been subjected to a parallel alignment process, wherein the pretilt angles of the liquid crystal at the upper and lower boundaries of the liquid crystal layer arranged between the array substrate provided with the pixel electrode and the opposing substrate provided with the common electrode have opposite signs; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> a disclination line forming step of applying a first voltage for forming a disclination line between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, and forming a disclination line at a boundary between a first liquid crystal cell region and a second liquid crystal cell region; and </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With this method, the splay&mdash;bend alignment transition occurs reliably at a certain location (namely at the disclination lines) within the pixel regions provided with many liquid crystal cells in the liquid crystal display device, and transition seeds appear reliably, because the bending energy at the disclination lines is higher than around them. Consequently, a reliable and fast alignment transition can be ensured, and a high-quality and inexpensive liquid crystal display device without display defects can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> According to a twenty-sixth aspect of the invention, in a method for manufacturing a liquid crystal display device as in the twenty-fifth aspect, the preparation step includes an alignment process step of arranging the liquid crystal molecules in one pixel region in b-splay alignment by subjecting them to an alignment process such that a pretilt angle of the liquid crystal on the pixel electrode side becomes smaller than a pretilt angle of the liquid crystal on the common electrode side, and arranging the liquid crystal molecules in another pixel region in t-splay alignment by subjecting them to an alignment process such that a pretilt angle of the liquid crystal on the pixel electrode side becomes larger than a pretilt angle of the liquid crystal on the common electrode side. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on results from observations made regarding a mechanism for a transition from splay alignment to bend alignment (explained below) in a liquid crystal display device provided with OCB cells of the bend alignment type. Thus, the specifics of the present invention will be explained in the embodiments after explaining this transition mechanism in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a portion of a liquid crystal display device provided with OCB cells of the bend alignment type. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the configuration of this liquid crystal display device provided with OCB cells of the bend alignment type: A liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> including liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed between substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel. Display electrodes (not shown in the drawings) for applying an electric field to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and alignment films (not shown in the drawings) governing the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules are formed on opposing surfaces of the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The alignment films pretilt the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the boundary to the substrate for ca. 5 to 7&deg; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and are subjected to an alignment process leading to the same alignment orientation within the substrate plane, that is, providing parallel orientation. Further away from the surfaces of the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> gradually rise upright, leading to a bend alignment, in which the tilt angle of the liquid crystal molecules is 90&deg; at approximately the center in thickness direction of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Polarizers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and optical compensators <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are arranged on the outer sides of the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The polarization axes of the two polarizers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged at right angles or in parallel, such that their polarization axes and the alignment orientation of the liquid crystal molecules cross at an angle of 45&deg;. Then, using the difference in the refractive index anisotropy in the liquid crystal layer between the ON state in which a high voltage is applied and the OFF state, in which a low voltage is applied, display is carried out while changing the polarization with the polarizers and the optical compensators, and controlling the transmissivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In this liquid crystal display device provided with OCB cells of the bend alignment type, the liquid crystal layer has a splay alignment before use, so that before operating the liquid crystal display, the liquid crystal layer has to be transitioned from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically shows a mechanism for an alignment transition, in which the splay alignment of the liquid crystal layer is transitioned to a bend alignment by applying a voltage that is larger than the critical transition voltage. </paragraph>

When there is no electric field between the substrates, the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> take on a splay alignment with low energy, in which the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the center of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are approximately parallel to the substrate planes. Here, the liquid crystal molecules that are parallel to the substrate are marked by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for illustrative reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b) </italic></highlight>shows the arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules when starting to apply a high voltage to the electrodes (not shown in the drawings) formed on the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The electric field starts to tilt slightly the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the center of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and as a result, the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that are parallel to the substrate planes shift toward one of the substrates (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, toward the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) shows the arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules after more time has passed after applying the voltage. The liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the center of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> tilt further with respect to the substrate planes, and the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that are approximately parallel to the substrate planes are now closer to the substrate boundary, where they are subjected to the strong regulative force of the alignment film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) shows the arrangement when the liquid crystal molecules have transitioned to bend alignment, with an even higher energy state The liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the center of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are now perpendicular with respect to the substrate planes, and the liquid crystal molecules contacting the boundary of the alignment film (not shown in the drawings) on the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are subjected to the strong regulative force of the alignment film, so that they retain their oblique orientation, and there are almost no more liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>arranged in parallel to the substrate planes, as there were in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> When even more time as passed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the alignment between the substrates shifts to the bend alignment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, ending the transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> It is believed that these are the circumstances under which the transition from splay alignment to bend alignment takes place when applying a voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> However, usually when the transition occurs, it does not occur at once in the entire liquid crystal layer between the substrates, but transition seeds occur around spacers distributed throughout the gap or at alignment irregularities (that is, at portions of the alignment region, at which energy transitions are easier), from which the bend alignment region spreads. Consequently, in order to achieve an alignment transition in the OCB cells, it is necessary to create transition seeds in at least some of the regions of the liquid crystal layer between the substrates, and, applying energy from the outside, to make a shift from splay alignment to the bend alignment with higher energy, and to maintain this bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Examining this mechanism of alignment transition, the inventors conceived of a liquid crystal display device in which transition seeds appear reliably and in which transitions can be accomplished in very short time, as well as a method for manufacturing such a liquid crystal display device and a method for driving a liquid crystal display device. The specifics of the invention are explained under reference to the embodiments. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIRST EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating the configuration for one pixel unit in the method of driving a liquid crystal display device in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. First, the configuration of a liquid crystal display device associated with the driving method of the first embodiment is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Except for the configuration of the driving circuit, the liquid crystal display device of the first embodiment has the same configuration as a liquid crystal display device provided with regular OCB cells. That is to say, it has a pair of glass substrates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed between the glass substrates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The glass substrates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are arranged in opposition with a predetermined spacing between them. A common electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of transparent ITO is formed on the inner side of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> made of transparent ITO is formed on the inner side of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>.

Then, a p-type nematic liquid crystal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed between the alignment films <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The pretilt angle of the liquid crystal molecules on the alignment films <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is set to about 5&deg;, and the critical voltage for transition from splay alignment to bend alignment is set to 2.5V.

<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of a driving method in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Before liquid crystal display driving with a regular image signal, an initialization process is carried out for transition into bend alignment. First, when turning on the power, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> outputs the switching signals S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the switching circuits <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> applies the driving voltage shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to the electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This driving voltage is an ac voltage, in which an ac square voltage A is superimposed with a bias voltage B, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and the driving voltage is set to a value that is larger than the critical voltage, which is the minimum voltage necessary for transition from the splay alignment to the bend alignment. Applying this driving voltage, it becomes possible to make the transition time much shorter than in the conventional examples that simply apply an ac voltage. The reasons why the transition time is shortened are explained below. Thus, the initialization process for transition into the bend alignment is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Then, after the transition time for completing the transition over the entire electrode has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> outputs to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>a switching signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that switches the connection of the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>a switching signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that switches the connection of the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Thus, the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected with the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected with the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and applying a driving signal voltage with the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the desired image is displayed. Here, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applies a 30 Hz square voltage of 2.7V sustaining the bend alignment in the OFF state, and a 30 Hz square voltage of 7V in the ON state, thus achieving display on the OCB panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Then, the inventors produced a liquid crystal display device with this configuration and experimentally performed the initialization process with this driving method; the results are listed below. The experimental conditions were as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The electrode area was set to 2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cell gap to ca. 6 &mgr;m, the frequency of the ac square voltage A to 30 Hz and its amplitude to &plusmn;4V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, the transition times were measured for the four different bias voltages B of 0V, 2V, 4V and 5V; the results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Here, &ldquo;transition time&rdquo; means the time needed to complete the transition of the alignment for the entire region of the electrode area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> As becomes clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the bias voltage B is 0V, a transition time of 140 s is needed. On the other hand, when the bias voltage B is 4V, the transition time can be shortened to only 8s. It seems that due to the superimposition of the bias voltage, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer is disturbed by the bias voltage, so that deviations occur between the substrates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), leading to many transition seeds, and that the increase of the effective voltage speeds up the transition time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Thus, by continuously applying an ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage, the transition time can be made shorter than when simply applying an ac voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In this experimental example, the ac square voltage signal had a frequency of 30 Hz and an amplitude of &plusmn;4V, but the present invention is not limited to this, and any frequency with which the liquid crystal can be operated is suitable, such as even 10 kHz, and the transition time can of course be shortened by increasing the amplitude of the ac voltage A. The transition time is shorter, the higher the superimposed bias voltage B is. However, striving for lower voltages as driving voltages, it is preferable that the bias voltage is set to a suitable voltage level depending on the desired transition time. Furthermore, a square wave was used as the waveform, but it is also possible to use an ac waveform with a different duty ratio. </paragraph>

If the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, then the driving voltage from the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is applied to the electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of a driving method in accordance with the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Before liquid crystal display driving with a regular image signal, an initialization process is carried out for transition into bend alignment. First, when turning on the power, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> applies the driving voltage shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to the electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Then, after a predetermined period of time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This leads to an open state, in which the electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are disconnected from the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This open state is maintained for a period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, during which the charge between the electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> When the period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the open state has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is again connected with the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, this alignment transition driving and the open state are repeated in alternation, and after a certain period of time has passed after turning on power, the entire area of the electrode has transitioned into bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Then, after this period of time has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>so that the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact P<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, so that the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applies a driving signal voltage to the electrodes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the desired image is displayed. Here, as in the first embodiment, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applies a 30 Hz square voltage of 2.7V sustaining the bend alignment in the OFF state, and a 30 Hz square voltage of 7V in the ON state, thus achieving display on the OCB panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Then, the inventors produced a liquid crystal display device with this configuration and experimentally performed the initialization process with this driving method; the results are listed below. The experimental conditions were as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The electrode area was set to 2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cell gap to ca. 6 &mgr;m, the bias voltage B was set to 2V, the frequency of the ac square voltage D to 30 Hz and its amplitude to &plusmn;4V, and the application time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was set to 2 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, the transition times were measured with 0 s, 0.2 s, 2 s and 3 s for the open state period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, repeating the voltage application state and the open state in alternation. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Here, &ldquo;transition time&rdquo; means the time needed to complete the transition of the alignment for the entire region of the electrode area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> As becomes clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the open state period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was 0 s, that is, when the ac voltage superimposed with the bias voltage was applied continuously, a transition time of 80 s was needed. When, on the other hand, the open state period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was 0.2 s, and alternated with the ac voltage with the superimposed bias voltage, then the transition time was shortened to 40 s. However, when the open state period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was 2 s, then the transition time became 420 s long, and when W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was 3 s, then the transition could not be finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the application time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was set to 0.3 s and the open state period W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to 0.3 s, and the remaining conditions were as in the above example, a transition time of 28 s was measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Favorable results were obtained when T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was set to 2 s, and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was at least 0.1 s but not greater than 0.5 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> It seems that the shortening of the time for shifting from splay alignment to bend alignment by repeating the biased ac voltage and the open state in this manner is due to the following reasons: Applying an ac voltage with a superimposed bias, the liquid crystal molecule alignment of the liquid crystal layer is disturbed, and deviations occur between the substrates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), and transition seeds are generated by switching then to a short open state, shortening the transition time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> This effect can also be attained when applying yet another voltage signal before or after the step of applying the ac voltage with the superimposed bias, and then going into the open state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Also, the bias voltage and the ac voltage, the application time, and the time that the open state is maintained can be chosen as appropriate for the desired transition time. The frequency of the ac voltage should be a frequency at which the liquid crystal can be operated, such as even 10 kHz. A square wave was used as the waveform, but it is also possible to use an ac waveform with a different duty ratio. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Then, after this period of time has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>so that the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact P<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Thus, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applies a driving signal voltage to the electrodes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the desired image is displayed. Here, as in the first embodiment, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applies a 30 Hz square voltage of 2.7V sustaining the bend alignment in the OFF state, and a 30 Hz square voltage of 7V in the ON state, thus achieving display on the OCB panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Then, the inventors produced a liquid crystal display device with this configuration and experimentally performed the initialization process with this driving method; the results are listed below. The experimental conditions were as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The electrode area was set to 2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cell gap to ca. 6 &mgr;m, the bias voltage D was set to 2V, the frequency of the ac square voltage C to 30 Hz and its amplitude to &plusmn;4V, and the application time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to 1 s. Furthermore, the voltage applied during the low voltage application period W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to a dc voltage of &minus;2V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, the transition times were measured for several low voltage application periods W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, repeating the voltage application state and the application voltage application state in alternation. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> As becomes clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when the low voltage application time is 0 s, that is, when the ac voltage superimposed with the bias voltage was applied continuously, a transition time of ca. 80 s was needed. When, on the other hand, the low voltage application period W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to 0.1 s and repeated in alternation with the ac voltage superimposed with the bias voltage, then the transition time was shortened to 60 s. However, when the low voltage application period W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to 1 s, then the transition time became 360 s long, and when W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to 3 s, then the transition could not be finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, repeatedly switching between an ac voltage of &plusmn;4V superimposed with a bias voltage of 2V and a dc voltage of 0V, the transition was completed within 50 s in the shortest case. Also, repeatedly switching between an ac voltage of &plusmn;4V superimposed with a bias voltage of 2V and an ac voltage of &plusmn;2V, the transition was completed within 50 s in the shortest case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Favorable results were obtained when T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to 1 s, and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was at least 0.1 s but not greater than 0.5 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The transition time for shifting from splay alignment to bend alignment when repeating application of the biased ac voltage and of the low voltage is shorter than when simply applying a continuous ac voltage superimposed with a bias voltage. It seems that this is, because applying an ac voltage with a bias superimposed on it, the liquid crystal molecule alignment in the liquid crystal layer is disturbed, and deviations occur between the substrates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), and transition seeds are created by switching then to a short low voltage application state, shortening the transition time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Also, the bias voltage and the ac voltage, and their application time, as well as the low voltage and its application time can be chosen as appropriate for the desired transition time. The frequency of the ac voltage should be a frequency at which the liquid crystal can be operated, such as 10 kHz. A square wave was used as the waveform, but it is also possible to use an ac waveform with a different duty ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the low voltage application period W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a low voltage of &minus;2V was applied, but it is also possible to apply 0V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The following is a discussion of the ratio between the ac voltage application period T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the low voltage application period W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the number of times the ac voltage application and the low voltage application are repeated per second. The voltage during the low voltage application period W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 0V, and the ac voltage application is repeated in alternation with this application of 0V, which, for illustrative reasons, is regarded as one transition voltage as indicated by the broken line L in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In that case, to shorten the transition time, the frequency of the transition voltage L should be set within a region of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz and the duty ratio of the transition voltage L should be set within a region of 1:1 to 1000:1. It is preferable that the frequency of the transition voltage L is within a range of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, and that the duty ratio of the transition voltage L is set within a region of 2:1 to 1000:1. The following explains the reasons for this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> When the duty ratio of the repeatedly applied voltage is in the range of 1:1 to 1:10, transition seeds may appear during the pulses in which voltage is applied, but between the pulses, when no voltage is applied, the transition returns to splay alignment within a certain relaxation time, and the transition never completes. In order to enlarge the transition region, the duty ratio should be set to a range of 1:1 to 1000:1, preferably 2:1 to 100:1, so that the pulse width is broader than the interval between pulses. It seems that above 1000:1 toward continuous dc, as there is almost no pulse repetition left, there are fewer opportunities for transition seeds to form, and the transition takes somewhat longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Also, for the repetition frequency of the transition voltage application, a frequency between continuous application and about 100 Hz is suitable, but preferable is a frequency from 10 Hz, at which a pulse width of at least about 100 ms can be attained for transition enlargement, to 0.1 Hz, at which a pulse interval of at least about 10ms is attained at a duty ratio of 1000:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> The inventors measured the transition time applying an alternation a voltage of &minus;15V dc and 0V to the liquid crystal cell and changing the repetition frequency and the duty ratio. The results are shown in Table 1.

<heading lvl="1">FOURTH EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a diagram of the configuration of a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the present invention for one pixel unit. The fourth embodiment illustrates an example, in which the present invention is applied to a method for driving an active matrix liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> First, the configuration of a liquid crystal display device associated with the driving method of the fourth embodiment is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Except for the configuration of the driving circuit, the liquid crystal display device in accordance with the fourth embodiment has the same configuration as an active matrix liquid crystal display device with regular OCB cells. That is to say, it has a pair of glass substrates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> interposed between the glass substrates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The glass substrates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are arranged in opposition to one another at a certain spacing. A common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> made of transparent ITO is formed on the inner side of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a thin film transistor (TFT) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> serving as a pixel switching element and a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> made of transparent ITO and connected to the TFT <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are formed on the inner side of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Alignment films <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of polyimide are formed on the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and these alignment films <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are subjected to an alignment process so as to arrange their alignment directions in parallel. Then, a p-type nematic liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disposed between the alignment films <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The pretilt angle of the liquid crystal molecules on the alignment films <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is set to about 5&deg;, and the critical voltage for transition from splay alignment to bend alignment is set to 2.6V. The retardation of the optical compensator <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is selected such that the display is either white or black during the ON state. The numerals <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> denote polarizers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, numerals <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> denote alignment transition driving circuits. The function of the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is to apply a driving voltage to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, taking the potential of the common electrode in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> as a center reference, and to apply 0V to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The function of the other alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is to apply 0V to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> denotes a liquid crystal display driving circuit. The function of the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is to apply a driving voltage with the voltage pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. That is to say, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> applies the voltage marked Ml in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and the voltage marked M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. This means that in this configuration, during the alignment transition period, 0V is applied to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, but it is also possible to apply a pixel electrode voltage with the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> during the alignment transition period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Numerals <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>denote switching circuits, and numeral <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> denotes a switching control circuit for controlling the switching of the switching circuits <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes three individual contact points P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and a common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes three individual contact points P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, then the driving voltage from the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is applied to the electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. When the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, then the driving voltage from the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is applied to the electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of a driving method in accordance with the fourth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Before liquid crystal display driving with a regular image signal, an initialization process is carried out for transition into bend alignment. First, when turning on the power, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> applies the driving voltage shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. This means, an ac voltage synchronized with the vertical synchronization signal, to which a bias voltage &minus;GV is superimposed, is applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, taking the potential of the common electrode as a center reference. 0V is applied to the pixel electrode. Then, this ac voltage is maintained for the period T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Then, after this ac voltage application period T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>such that the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the alignment transition driving circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> applies 0V to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. This 0V voltage stays applied for a period W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> When the 0V voltage application period W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>so the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is again connected with the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is again connected with the individual contact point P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then, this ac voltage application step and the 0V voltage application step are repeated in alternation, and after a certain period of time has passed after turning on power, the entire area of the electrode has passed into bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Then, after this certain period of time has passed, the switching control circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> outputs a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching signal to the switching circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>so that the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the common contact point Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual contact P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thus, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> applies a driving signal voltage to the electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and the desired image is displayed. Here, the liquid crystal display driving circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> applies a driving voltage of at least 2.7V sustaining the bend alignment in the OFF state, and a voltage of 7V as an upper limit in the ON state, thus achieving display on the OCB panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> With this driving method, a high-quality bend alignment display device with a broad viewing angle and very fast response was attained, without any alignment defects in the OCB active matrix liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Then, the inventors produced a liquid crystal display device with this configuration and experimentally performed the initialization process with this driving method; the results are listed below. The experimental conditions were as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The cell gap was set to ca. 6 &mgr;m, the bias voltage G was set to &minus;6V, the frequency of the ac square voltage D to 7.92 Hz and its amplitude to &plusmn;10V, and the application time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was set to 0.5 s. Moreover, the 0V voltage application period W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> was set to 0.5 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> According to the experimental results, the alignment transition in all the pixels in the panel of the liquid crystal display device was finished within approximately 2 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> When no bias voltage was superimposed, then about 20 s were necessary for the transition of the alignment of the entire display. Thus, it can be appreciated that also in the fourth embodiment, the driving with a superimposed bias voltage accomplishes a shortening of the transition time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIFTH EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Instead of the driving voltage pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, it is also possible to use the driving voltage pattern in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> for driving the alignment transition of an OCB-mode active matrix liquid crystal display device. That is to say, during the ac voltage application period T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a dc voltage of &minus;15V is applied for 0.5 s to the common electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, taking the potential of the common electrode as a center reference. After that, during the 0V voltage application period W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, 0V is applied for 0.2 s. Then, the application of &minus;15V dc and the application of 0V are repeated in alternation. Also with this driving method, the transition is carried out reliably and in a very short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Carrying out experiments with this driving method, the inventors found that a transition time of less than 2 s can be attained. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SIXTH EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> Instead of the active matrix liquid crystal display device used in the fourth and fifth embodiments, the sixth embodiment applies the driving method of the fourth and fifth- embodiments to a liquid crystal display device with a flattened film configuration, in which a flattening film is arranged on the switching element, and the pixel electrode is formed on the flattening film. To give a specific example of this driving method, the alignment transition voltage superimposed with the bias voltage in the fourth embodiment was applied for 0.5 s, and then the open state was held for 0.5 s, which was repeated in alternation. With this driving method, the transition went even smoother, with a transition time of less than 1 s. It seems that this is, because with the flattening film configuration, the pixel electrode interval becomes smaller, so that a smoother transition from the splay alignment to the bend alignment is possible. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Then, the region on the right side in the paper plane of the alignment film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(that is, the region in opposition to the larger pretilt angle B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is irradiated with UV light to reduce the pretilt angle D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (fourth pretilt angle) by about 2&deg;, thereby forming the alignment film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> In this manner, a smaller pretilt angle A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (first pretilt angle) is formed in opposition to a larger pretilt angle C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (second pretilt angle), and a larger pretilt angle B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (third pretilt angle) is formed in opposition to a smaller pretilt angle D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (fourth pretilt angle), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The pretilt angles can also be controlled as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the left region of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is irradiated with UV light under an ozone atmosphere, and is made flatter than the right region of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, thus forming a flattened region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a pre-imide polyimide alignment material by JSR Corp. is spread on the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and dried and baked, to form the alignment film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> arranged on the flattened region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be made smaller than the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> arranged on the non-flattened region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Furthermore, by performing the same process with the common electrode as well, a liquid crystal display device is attained that has the first liquid crystal cell region and the second liquid crystal cell region shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> within the same pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the surface of the alignment film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and of the alignment film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> formed as above and provided with small and large pretilt angles in opposition to one another, is subjected to a parallel alignment process by rubbing with a rubbing cloth in a direction perpendicular to the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and in the same direction for the upper and the lower substrate (that is, from left to right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>), arranging the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of positive nematic liquid crystal material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device manufactured in this manner, the smaller pretilt angle A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged toward the alignment origin (near the source of the rubbing movement) of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and the larger pretilt angle C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged in opposition to the pretilt angle A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Applying a first voltage of 2.5V between the common electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a b-splay alignment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, in which the liquid crystal molecules are splay aligned on the side of the array substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, forms easily in the region (I) of the pixel in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> (first liquid crystal cell region), and a t-splay alignment <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, in which the liquid crystal molecules are splay aligned on the side of the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, forms easily in the region (II) of the pixel (second liquid crystal cell region). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, when applying a first voltage of 2.5V between the common electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through the switching element <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal cell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a b-splay alignment region (first liquid crystal region) and a t-splay alignment region (second liquid crystal region) are formed in the pixel, and at the border between the two, a disclination line <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is clearly formed along the signal electrode line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and straddling the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; (disclination line forming step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Repeatedly applying a &minus;15V voltage pulse as a second voltage between the common electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, transition seeds were created starting at the disclination line <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, and spreading the transition to bend alignment <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, all of the TFT panel pixels transitioned swiftly in three seconds (alignment transition step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> It seems that in the disclination line region at the border between regions of b-splay alignment and t-splay alignment, the bending energy is higher than in the surrounding regions, and when in this state, even more energy is directed to it by applying a high voltage to the upper and lower electrodes, the splay alignment transitions into bend alignment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a diagrammatic drawing of a liquid crystal display device in accordance with the eighth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> During regular display, the gate electrode lines are scanned line by line and turned on, but before regular display, the gate electrode lines are turned on one by one, and repeatedly applying a &minus;15V voltage pulse as a second voltage between the common electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> generates a transversal electric field caused by the potential difference between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;. Then, due to this transversal field, transition seeds appear starting near the disclination line <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, spreading the transition into bend alignment, and all of the TFT panel pixels transition swiftly within about one second (alignment transition step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> It seems that in the disclination line region at the border between regions of b-splay alignment and t-splay alignment, the bending energy is higher than in the surrounding regions, and directing even more energy to the disclination line by applying a transversal field from the transversally arranged gate electrode lines in this state leads to a swift transition. After the transition is finished, the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; are returned to their regular scanning state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that it is also possible to apply the second voltage between the pixel electrode and the common electrode continuously. Also, the effect of speeding up the transition can be attained when a pulse-shaped voltage is applied repeatedly, if its frequency is in a range of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz, and the duty ratio of the second voltage is at least 1:1 to 1000:1. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> In the seventh and eighth embodiments, the pretilt angle D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the pre-alignment region of the common electrode that was aligned first was set to a smaller value, but it can also be set to a larger value. Moreover, the pretilt angle B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the region of the pixel electrode that was aligned first was set to a larger value, but an effect can also be attained with a small value, because t-splay alignment is assumed due to the influence of the transversal electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the pretilt angle A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was set to 2&deg; on one substrate and the pretilt angle C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was set to 5&deg; on the opposing substrate, and making this ratio is larger has the effect of shortening the transition time, so that the transition time can be made even faster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the preceding embodiments, the value of the smaller pretilt angle A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was set to 2&deg;. In order to achieve an easy transition from b-splay alignment to bend alignment, it is sufficient if the smaller pretilt angles A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are not larger than 3&deg;, and the larger pretilt angles B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are at least 4&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the upper and lower substrates have been subjected to a parallel alignment process in which the alignment processing direction was in the same direction perpendicular to the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, but it is also possible to perform a parallel alignment process in which the alignment processing direction is the same direction perpendicular to the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (that is, in a direction perpendicular to the paper plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). In that case, the disclination line is formed at a different location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the alignment processing direction forms an angle of for example about 2&deg; with the direction perpendicular to the electrode lines along the pixel electrodes, then the transversal electric field is applied at an angle from the electrodes to the disclination line in the pixel, so that the force twisting the splay aligned liquid crystal molecules increases, assisting the transition into the bend alignment, leading to a liquid crystal display device with a reliable and swift transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> For the first voltage, a voltage is sufficient that is equal to or higher than the voltage at which the disclination line can be formed. Also, a second voltage was applied between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, but the second voltage can also be applied to the common electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a polyimide material was used as the material for the alignment film, but it is also possible to use another material, such as a monomolecular layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to make the substrates in the liquid crystal display device of plastic, for example. Furthermore, it is also possible to use a reflecting substrate, such as silicon, for one substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as in conventional liquid crystal display devices, light and dark display is achieved by the effect of the polarizers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and the effect of the transition of all the liquid crystal molecules in the pixels between the opposing substrates from splay alignment to bend alignment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> A polyimide alignment film material of polyamic acid type (by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.), having a large pretilt angle of about 5&deg; is spread on the surface of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the transversal electric field application portions and the common electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>dried and baked, thereby forming the alignment films <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on these electrode surfaces on the side of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Thus, although this is not shown in the drawings, on the surface of the upper and lower alignment films <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the pretilt angles of the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> have opposite signs, and the molecules are aligned with the long axis direction substantially in parallel, so that when the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is in the so-called non-voltage application state, the liquid crystal molecules are spread obliquely in so-called splay alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> The following explains how display with this liquid crystal display device works. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> A pulse-shaped voltage of &minus;15V, which is a relatively high voltage in the field of liquid crystals, is applied repeatedly between the common electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are either put into the regular scanning state or almost all gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are put into the ON state. Due to the transversal electric field application portions, a transversal electric field, that is larger than the usual transversal electric field around it, is applied between the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>As a result, if the splay alignment region within the pixel region has been rubbed in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, transition seeds for a transition toward bend alignment in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>299</bold></highlight> appear, starting mainly at the transversal electric field application portions between the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Moreover, if the splay alignment region has been rubbed in a direction that is perpendicular to the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, transition seeds for a transition toward bend alignment in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> appear, starting mainly at the transversal electric field application portions between the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as a result of the spreading of the bend alignment region around these transition seeds, transition into the bend alignment could be accomplished in about 0.5 s for the entire pixel region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The entire TFT panel transitioned swiftly within about 2 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> It seems that with this configuration, applying a high voltage between the upper and the lower electrodes, the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> assumes b-splay alignment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the bending energy becomes higher than in the surrounding areas, and since the transversal electric field application portions apply a transversal field that is substantially perpendicularly (that is, perpendicularly to the plane of FIG. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) to the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in this state, the liquid crystal molecules on the lower substrate side in b-splay alignment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are twisted, leading to the creation of transition seeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing explanation, the transversal electric field application portions were formed such that that the recesses and protrusions in the deformed pixel electrode fitted into the recesses and protrusions of the signal electrode lines, but as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, it is of course also possible to form the transversal electric field application portions only in the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>only in the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, or only in the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the difference between in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the protrusions do not fit into the recesses, and there is only one of the protrusion <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> in the signal electrode line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the protrusion <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> in the gate electrode line <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and the protrusions <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>a and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the planar shape of the protrusions and recesses can be triangular or rectangular as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</cross-reference>, but it can of course also be trapezoid, semi-circular, circular, or elliptical, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</cross-reference>, the transversal electric field application portions are provided at a total of four locations, namely at top and bottom as well as left and right, but in accordance with for example the size of the pixel, it is also possible to provide them only at two locations or even only one location, and needless to say, it is also possible to form protrusions and recesses continuously along the electrode edges. Also, in the preceding, the rubbing direction was substantially perpendicular to either the signal electrode line or the gate electrode line, but the rubbing direction can also be diagonal. In that case, the transition into bend alignment will start at the liquid crystal layer at the transversal electric field application portions between the signal and gate electrode lines and the pixel electrode. It is also preferable that each pixel is provided with at least one transversal electric field application portion that can apply a transversal electric field in at least a direction substantially perpendicular to the rubbing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Since <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</cross-reference> are plan views, both types of electrode lines (signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>) and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>appear to be in the same plane, but at least one type of electrode lines can be arranged at a different height from the pixel electrode on the array substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> Thus, the transversal electric field application portions made of electrode deformations, in which a portion of the sides of the pixel electrode is deformed to protrusions and recesses within a plane that is parallel to the substrate plane, are separated by about 0.5 to 10 &mgr;m in vertical direction, and the transversal electric field is generated due to the presence of the protrusions of the signal electrode lines or gate electrode lines on the sides of the transversal electric field application portions and the recesses with dents of about 0.5 to 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TENTH EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, electrode lines are provided for application of the transversal electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> The following explains this embodiment with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a plan view taken from above the substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional view taken in parallel to the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), numeral <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> denotes electrode lines dedicated to application of a transversal electric field and arranged approximately directly below the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> on the array substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Numeral <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> denotes a transparent insulating film for insulating the transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> from the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Consequently, when viewing this pixel from above (that is, from a user&apos;s viewing direction perpendicular to the display screen), protrusions <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> of triangular shape (when viewed from above) project from the transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> toward the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> at the center on the left and right of the pixel, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). It should be noted that the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are the same as in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> are connected to a driving circuit connected to the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> or the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and during regular liquid crystal display after the alignment transition, the transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> are disconnected from the driving circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to arrange the transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> as signal electrode lines above the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, near the pixel electrodes and separated from the pixel electrodes by a transparent insulating film, increasing the effect of the transversal field application, and to electrically connect them collectively by contact holes (not shown in the drawings) in the transparent insulating film. In that case, the redundancy is increased as there are two signal electrode lines, and there is also the effect of reduced electrical resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided directly above the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, separated by the transparent insulating film <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Also in this case, protrusions <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that are triangular when viewed from above protrude toward the pixel center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) shows another example of this embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the transversal electric field application lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are covered by a transparent flattening insulating film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>below the dedicated lines <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are covered by a transparent flattening insulating film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is arranged on the transparent flattening insulating film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Also in this case, protrusions <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are triangular when viewed from above protrude toward the pixel center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, the protrusions of the dedicated lines for transversal electric field application are triangular, but it is of course also possible to provide the protrusions continuously along the entire portion in opposition to the pixel electrodes, to provide protrusions that have a three-dimensional structure, projecting upward for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to provide the dedicated lines for transversal electric field application not directly below the signal electrode lines, but directly below the gate electrode lines. Furthermore, they can also be provided directly below both types of electrode lines. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">ELEVENTH EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, defect portions are formed, in which cutouts are provided at least at one location in the pixel electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows a plan view of one pixel unit in a liquid crystal display device in accordance with this embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> portion of several &mgr;m width is etched away from the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>made of an ITO film, forming a electrode defect portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> that is crank-shaped when viewed from above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> A polyimide alignment film material of polyamic acid type (by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.), having a pretilt angle of about 5&deg; is spread on the surface of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>including this electrode defect portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and on the surface of the common electrode (not shown in the drawings), dried and baked, thereby forming alignment films (not shown in the drawings). Then, the surfaces of these alignment films are both subjected to an alignment process by rubbing with a rubbing cloth in a direction perpendicular to the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, so that the pretilt angles of the liquid crystal molecules have opposite signs, and the molecules are aligned substantially in parallel, which is the same as in the ninth and tenth embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the liquid crystal layer also has so-called liquid crystal cells in splay alignment, made of regions in which the liquid crystal molecules widen up diagonally when no voltage is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> However, if, before display, a voltage pulse of 15V is applied repeatedly between the common electrode and the pixel electrode of the pixel, or a voltage pulse of &minus;15V is applied repeatedly to the common electrode, and the gate electrodes are either put into the regular scanning state or almost all gate electrodes are put into the ON state, then, due to the electrode cutout portions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> in each pixel unit, a strongly bent diagonal transverse electric field <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is generated at the edge of the electrode cutout portions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Therefore, seeds for transition into the bend alignment appear in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>299</bold></highlight> of these electrode cutout portions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, these bend alignment regions spread, and the splay alignment in the pixel region transitions completely into bend alignment in about 0.5 s for the entire pixel region. The entire TFT panel transitions swiftly within about 2 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> It seems that as a strong transversal electric field is generated at the transversal electric field application portions made of these electrode cutout portions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and the liquid crystal molecules nearby are aligned horizontally in the substrate plane in a so-called b-splay alignment, the bending energy becomes higher than in the surrounding areas, and as a result of applying even more energy with the high voltage applied between the upper and lower electrodes in this situation, transition seeds appear at the electrode defect portions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, and the bend alignment regions spread. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> Only one electrode defect portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> that is crank-shaped when viewed from above is formed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, but it is of course also possible to form two or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> Also, its form can of course also be straight, angular, circular, elliptical, or triangular, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the electrode cutout portions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can also be formed on the side of the common electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> Needless to say, they can also be formed on both the pixel electrode and the common electrode. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TWELFTH EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a transverse electric field is generated, and regions with different tilt angles in the pixel plane are formed accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates the configuration and features of one pixel unit in a liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional view of the pixel, taken in parallel to the gate electrode lines, and shows how the tilt angles are different within the same pixel in region (I) on the left side and region (II) on the right side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a plan view of the pixel taken from above (where the user is). Recesses and protrusions <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided at top and bottom as well as left and right of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and recesses and protrusions <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> fitting into the recesses and protrusions <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided at corresponding positions of the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. As in the seventh embodiment explained above, a disclination line <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is formed at the border between the regions (I) and (II) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> when applying a first voltage of 2.5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of a method for manufacturing the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> Alignment films <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>am </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bm </italic></highlight>are formed on the inner faces of opposing substrates for active matrix liquid crystal cells. These alignment films <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>am </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bm </italic></highlight>are subjected to a process forming a splay alignment when no voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and transition-inducing transversal electric field application portions are formed for example at the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> arranged nearby, which is the same as in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> However, the processing of the alignment films is different. That is to say, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a polyimide alignment film material of polyamic acid type (by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.), having a large pretilt angle B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of about 5&deg; is spread on the surface of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the transversal electric field application portions, dried and baked, thereby forming the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>am. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> Then, only the left region <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ah </italic></highlight>of the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>am, </italic></highlight>that is, only the region (I) is irradiated with UV light to decrease the pretilt angle E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a smaller angle of about 2&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a polyimide alignment film material of polyamic acid type (by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.), providing the boundary liquid crystal molecules with a large pretilt angle F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of about 5&deg; is spread on the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>dried and baked, thereby forming the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bh </italic></highlight>on the common electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> Then, only the right region <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bm </italic></highlight>of the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bh, </italic></highlight>that is, only the region (II) is irradiated with UV light to decrease the pretilt angle D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a smaller angle of about 2&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> Thus, a smaller pretilt angle E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed in the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ah </italic></highlight>on the left half of the array substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in opposition to a larger pretilt angle F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bh </italic></highlight>in the left half of the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as shown in region (I) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and a larger pretilt angle B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed in the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>am </italic></highlight>in the right half of the array substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in opposition to a smaller pretilt angle D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the alignment film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>bm </italic></highlight>in the right half of the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as shown in region (II). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the surfaces of the alignment films, provided with small and large pretilt angles arranged like this in opposition to one another, are both subjected to a parallel alignment process by rubbing with a rubbing cloth in a direction substantially perpendicular to the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the same direction for the upper and the lower substrate, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Then, a positive nematic liquid crystal material is filled in, forming the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, the smaller pretilt angle E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged toward the alignment origin (toward the source of the rubbing movement) in the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the larger pretilt angle F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged in opposition to this pretilt angle E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a b-splay alignment <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>in which the liquid crystal molecules are splay aligned at the lower substrate forms more readily in the pixel region (I) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and a t-splay alignment <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t, </italic></highlight>in which the liquid crystal molecules are splay aligned at the upper substrate forms more readily in the pixel region (II). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> Then, applying a voltage of 2.5V, which is near the transition critical voltage, to the opposing electrodes through the switching transistors <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal cells, a b-splay alignment region and a t-splay alignment region were formed in the same pixel (for the reasons explained above), and a disclination line <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> was formed clearly at the border of these alignment regions along the signal electrode lines <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, straddling the gate electrode lines <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> Repeatedly applying a &minus;15V voltage pulse between the common electrode and the pixel electrode in this pixel, transition seeds appeared starting at the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>299</bold></highlight> near the disclination line <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and near the transversal electric field application portions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the transition to bend alignment regions spread, and all of the TFT panel pixels transitioned swiftly within about one second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> It seems that in the region of the disclination line <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> at the border between regions of b-splay alignment and t-splay alignment, the bending energy is higher than in the surrounding regions, and due to the transversal electric field generated at the transversal field application portions in addition to this state, the splay alignment is twisted and transitions more readily, and applying a high voltage between the upper and lower electrodes, even more energy is directed to it, leading to the transition into bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Above, several embodiments of the present invention have been explained, but it is to be understood that these embodiments are in no way intended to limit the present invention. For example, the following variations are possible: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> 1) The voltage is applied between pixel electrode and common electrode is continuous or an intermittent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> 2) When the high voltage pulse is applied repeatedly, its frequency is in the range from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz, and the duty ratio of the second voltage is in the range of at least 1:1 to 1000:1, selecting values that accelerate the transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> 3) Plastic is used for the substrates, and organic conducting films are used for the electrodes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> 5) As an additional measure, the pixel electrodes and the common electrode are provided with protrusions for the generation of a strong electrode electric field in a direction perpendicular to the substrate plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> 6) As an additional measure, protrusions instead of globular glass or silica beads are provided to keep a predetermined distance between the substrates, and these protrusions also have the function to arrange the liquid crystal molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> 7) The upper portions or the lower portions of these protrusions also serve as the protrusions for strong electrode generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> 8) The shape of the pixel electrodes is oblong or triangular, instead of square. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> Then, ITO electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of 2000A thickness are formed on this substrate with one of the usual methods, forming a glass substrate <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> with electrodes. Subsequently, an alignment film coating (SE-7492 by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.) is spread by spin-coating on a glass substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> with transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> provided with the bump-shaped protrusions, and cured for one hour in a thermostatic bath at 180&deg; C., thus forming the alignment films <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Then, a rubbing process is carried out, rubbing with a rubbing cloth by Toho Rayon Co., Ltd. in the direction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, and using spacers 5 by Sekisui Fine Chemical Corp. and Struct Bond 352A (tradename for a sealing resin by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc.), the substrates were laminated together at a spacing of 6.51 &mgr;m, thus producing a liquid crystal cell <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> (referred to as &ldquo;liquid crystal cell A&rdquo; in the following). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> The rubbing process was carried out such that the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal was about 5&deg; at the boundaries to the alignment film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> Then, a liquid crystal MJ96435 (with a refractive index anisotropy of &Dgr;n&equals;0.138) was vacuum injected into the liquid crystal cell A, thus yielding the test cell A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> Then, polarizers were laminated on the test cell A, such that the polarization axes of the polarizers formed an angle of 45&deg; with the direction of the rubbing process, and the polarization axes crossed at right angles. Applying a 7V square voltage pattern and observing the transition from splay alignment to bend alignment, the transition from splay alignment to bend alignment took about 5 s for the entire electrode region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> In the regions where the bump-shaped protrusions <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are formed, the liquid crystal layer is thinner than in the surrounding regions, effectively increasing the strength of the electric field, so that a reliable bend transition starting at these portions can be ensured. The bend alignment then spreads swiftly to the other regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> That is to say, a reliable and fast splay&rarr;bend transition can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> The cross-section of the bump-shaped protrusions can of course also be trapezoid, triangular, or semicircular, instead of rectangular as in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> As a comparative example, a splay alignment liquid crystal cell R was manufactured with the same process as above, except that a glass-substrate with transparent electrodes, but without the bump-shaped protrusions <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> was used, into which liquid crystal MJ96435 was filled, thus yielding a test cell R. Applying a 7V square voltage pattern to the test cell R, the time needed for the transition from splay alignment to bend alignment for the entire electrode region was 42 s, which clearly demonstrates the effect that the present invention has. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> An alignment film coating (SE-7492 by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.) is spread by spin-coating on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> with transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> provided with the bump-shaped protrusions, and cured for one hour in a thermostatic bath at 180&deg; C., thus forming the alignment films <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Then, a rubbing process is carried out, rubbing with a rubbing cloth by Toho Rayon Co., Ltd. in the direction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, and using spacers <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> by Sekisui Fine Chemical Corp. and Struct Bond 352A (tradename for a sealing resin by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc.), the substrates were laminated together at a spacing of 6.5 &mgr;m, thus producing a liquid crystal cell (referred to as &ldquo;liquid crystal cell B&rdquo; in the following).

Then, a rubbing process is carried out by rubbing with a rubbing cloth by Toho Rayon Co., Ltd. in the direction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, and using spacers <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> by Sekisui Fine Chemical Corp. and Struct Bond 352A (tradename for a sealing resin by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc.), the substrates were laminated together at a spacing of 6.5 &mgr;m, thus producing a liquid crystal cell <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> (referred to as &ldquo;liquid crystal cell C&rdquo; in the following). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> In this test cell C, concentrations of the electric field occur at the triangular tips, and bend alignment starts from these portions. Moreover, above the triangular portions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, there are portions that are rubbed downward and portions that are rubbed upward in the rubbing process, so that as a result, regions are formed in which the liquid crystal pretilt angle has the opposite sign. That is to say, near the bump-shaped protrusions, the liquid crystal directors are horizontal in the substrate plane, and this seems to contribute to a fast splay-bend transition. </paragraph>

The measurement was performed while lowering the voltage after applying a 10V square voltage for 10 s and confirming bend alignment. In this liquid crystal display element, the transition from bend alignment to splay alignment occurs at 2.1V, so that display has to be performed effectively at a voltage of at least 2.2V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> Then, it was measured how the contrast ratio depends on the viewing angle for a white level voltage of 2.2V and a black level voltage of 7.2V, and it was determined that a contrast ratio of at least 10:1 is attained over a range of 126&deg; vertical and 160&deg; horizontal.

<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the main elements of a liquid crystal display device of the nineteenth embodiment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a schematic diagram showing the alignment in the initial state when no electric field is applied. The liquid crystal cell, which functions as a bend alignment cell, has two parallel substrates <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> filled between the substrates, constituting a so-called sandwich cell. Usually, transparent electrodes are formed on one substrate, and thin film transistors are formed on the other substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a schematic diagram showing the alignment in the initial state when no electric field is applied. The alignment in the initial state is a homogenous alignment, which means that the molecular axes of the liquid crystal molecules are aligned substantially in parallel and practically homogenous while being slightly tilted with respect to the planes of the substrates <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The liquid crystal molecules at the boundaries to the substrates are tilted in opposite directions at the upper substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the lower substrate <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. This means that the alignment angles &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the liquid crystal molecules at the boundaries to the substrates (that is, the pretilt angles) have been adjusted to have opposite signs. In the following explanations, the alignment angle and the pretilt angle represent the tilt of the molecular axis of the liquid crystal molecules with respect to a plane parallel to the substrates, and are positive in counterclockwise direction, taking a plane parallel to the substrates as the reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> When an electric field that is stronger than the value in the direction perpendicular to the substrate plane is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the alignment of the liquid crystal changes, and the liquid crystal transitions into the alignment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> The alignment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is called bend alignment. The tilt of the liquid crystal molecule axes with respect to the substrate plane near the substrate surfaces, that is, the absolute value of the alignment angle, is small, and the absolute value of the alignment angle of the liquid crystal molecules at the center of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is large. Furthermore, the liquid crystal molecules are practically not twisted across the entire liquid crystal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> Observing the transition from homogenous alignment to bend alignment in detail, it can be seen that bend alignment seeds appear in portions of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and these seeds grow successively larger while eroding other regions that are still in homogenous alignment, until finally the entire liquid crystal layer is in bend alignment In other words, for the transition of the liquid crystal layer into bend alignment, the creation of seeds, that is, the transition of microscopic regions from homogenous alignment into bend alignment is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> The inventors have analyzed the transition of these microscopic regions into bend alignment by solving the kinetic equations of the unit vector (referred to as &ldquo;director&rdquo; below) for the liquid crystal molecule alignment, and have found conditions, under which the seeds can appear more readily. This approach is explained in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> The alignment of the liquid crystal is expressed by the director. The direction n can be written as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>n(x)&equals;(n<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>(x,y,z),n<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>(x,y,z),n<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>(x,y,z)) &emsp;&emsp;(Equation 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> As is shown in Equation 2, the free energy density f of the liquid crystal can be expressed as a function of the director n.

<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> In this equation, k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>, k<highlight><subscript>22 </subscript></highlight>and k<highlight><subscript>33 </subscript></highlight>are the Frank elastic constants, representing the elastic constants for splay, twist and bend. &Dgr;&egr; is the difference of the dielectric constant in the direction of the liquid crystal molecule axis and the dielectric constant in directions perpendicular thereto, that is, the dielectric anisotropy. E is the external electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> In Equation 2, the first, second and third terms represent the elastic energies for splay, twist and bend deformations of the liquid crystal. The fourth term represents the electrical energy due to the electrical interaction between the external electric field and the liquid crystal. If &Dgr;&egr;&gt;0, then the electrical energy is minimal when n is parallel to E and if &Dgr;&egr;&lt;0, then the electrical energy is minimal when n is perpendicular to E. Consequently, when applying an electric field E above a certain strength, the liquid crystal molecules align with their molecule axis in parallel to the electric field if &Dgr;&egr;&gt;0, and perpendicular to the electric field if &Dgr;&egr;&lt;0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> The total free energy F of the liquid crystal when the alignment of the molecules in the initial state is deformed by an external electric field can be expressed as the volume integral over f: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>F&equals;&int;f(n(x))dx &emsp;&emsp;(Equation 3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> As shown in Equation 3, the total free energy F is a function defined by taking the unknown function n(x) of the director as a variable (that is, a functional). The alignment of the liquid crystal under application of an external electric field is expressed by the n(x) at which the total free energy F becomes minimal for appropriate boundary conditions. This means, when the n(x) is determined at which F is minimal, then it is possible to predict the alignment of the liquid crystal. Furthermore, if the time-dependent director n(x, t) can be found at which F becomes minimal for appropriate boundary conditions, then it is possible to predict the behavior of the device, such as its optical constants. In physical terms, this is a typical example of the principle of least action, and in optical terms, this is a variational minimization problem with boundary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> Equation 3 can be solved theoretically. However, it is difficult to determine a functional form for the director n(x), because analytic methods, such as using Euler&apos;s equation, lead to complicated non-linear equations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the solving of Equation 3, the following approach is pursued. First, the integral space is subjected to discretization by a method such as the finite element method. That is to say, the total integral space is partitioned into np elements, and expressed as the sum of the integrals over all elements:

<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> The following approximation is performed for the director n(x) in the partial integral space &Dgr;V. As shown in Equation 2, n<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>, and n<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>are actually functions of x, y, and z, but it is assumed that they are constant in &Dgr;V. Furthermore, dn<highlight><subscript>x,j</subscript></highlight>/dx is approximated as d<highlight><subscript>nx,j</subscript></highlight>/dx&equals;(n<highlight><subscript>x,j&plus;1</subscript></highlight>&minus;dn<highlight><subscript>x,j</subscript></highlight>)/&Dgr;x. Here, n<highlight><subscript>x,j </subscript></highlight>is the n<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>in the j<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>element, which is constant in &Dgr;V as explained before, but which is unknown. This approximation of n(x) in the partial integral space &Dgr;V is coarse, but making the partitions of the integral space smaller can compensate this and improve the approximation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> With this approximation, n<highlight><subscript>x,j</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>y,j</subscript></highlight>, and n<highlight><subscript>z,j </subscript></highlight>are constants within each element in Equation 4, so that it is easy to calculate the integral itself. However, at this stage, a number of higher order terms and non-linear terms of the unknown n<highlight><subscript>x,j</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>y,j</subscript></highlight>, and n<highlight><subscript>z,j </subscript></highlight>proportional to the number of partitions are present in the equation for the total free energy F, so that this equation is still difficult. However, the values n<highlight><subscript>x,0</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>y,0</subscript></highlight>, and n<highlight><subscript>z,0</subscript></highlight>, can be easily given as the boundary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> With the above approximation, the free energy F takes on the form: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>F&equals;F(n<highlight><subscript>xj</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>yj</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>zj</subscript></highlight>) (0&lE;j&lE;np&minus;1) &emsp;&emsp;(Equation 5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the free energy F is converted from a functional with the unknown function n(x) as a variable to a function of the unknown n<highlight><subscript>x,j</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>y,j</subscript></highlight>, and n<highlight><subscript>z,j</subscript></highlight>. The unknown n<highlight><subscript>x,j</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>y,j</subscript></highlight>, and n<highlight><subscript>z,j </subscript></highlight>are the values minimizing the function F in multi-dimensional parameter space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the bend alignment of the liquid crystal is a structure practically without twisting. As mentioned before, the director n is actually a function of x, y, and z, but it can be expressed as a function of the alignment angle. In that case, the director n in the bend alignment can be expressed as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>n&equals;(cos&thgr;,0,sin&thgr;) &emsp;&emsp;(Equation 6) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> Here, &thgr; is the tilt of the liquid crystal molecules with respect to a plane parallel to the substrates, that is, the alignment angle. Furthermore, &thgr; is dependent only on the distance z of the liquid crystal molecules to the substrates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating these directors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> Inserting Equation 6 into Equation 4, and performing partitioning and discretization into np elements, the &thgr;j minimizing F is determined for each element. This means, for each element, the &thgr;j satisfying

<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the circuit corresponding to Equation 10 consists of np CR circuits. The second term in Equation 10 represents the current flowing through the CR circuits. Here, Rj is the resistance for discharge relaxation, and is a voltage controlled resistance, determining the current (i) flowing through the CR circuits as i&equals;&part;F(Vj)/&part;Vj. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> The current i (&equals;&part;F/&part;Vj) settles to zero at a certain Vj. This means, Vj is determined automatically when determining the voltage at which the current through the CR circuits is zero with a circuit simulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> Thus, by transforming the kinetic equations of the directors into an equivalent circuit, it is possible to analyze the non-linear equation system representing the effect of liquid crystal alignment with a circuit simulator, and to determine the relation between the external electric field E and the alignment (that is, the alignment angles &thgr;j). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> As in this approach, the non-linear equation system representing the alignment effect is converted into a circuit by electric circuit analogy and analyzed with a circuit simulator, the equivalent circuit can be simply entered into a program, and there is no need to include a calculation for solving the equation itself. Therefore, simplification and downsizing of the program can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by using this approach to calculate the change of the alignment angle &thgr;j as the external electric field E is increased, it is possible to determine the critical electric field Ec for liquid crystal transition as the external electric field Ec at which the alignment angles &thgr;j change abruptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> is an example of the calculation results of this approach, and shows the temporal change of &thgr;j when the external field E is increased with time. The results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> have been calculated setting the boundary conditions &thgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;&plus;0.1 rad, and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>np-1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&minus;0.1 rad, and with k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&equals;6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn, k<highlight><subscript>33</subscript></highlight>&equals;12&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn and &Dgr;&egr;&equals;10. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when starting to apply the electric field, all alignment angles &thgr;j are comparatively small, and the liquid crystal is in homogeneous alignment. However, after a certain time has passed, that is, when the external electric field E exceeds a certain value (E&gt;Ec), the alignment angles &thgr;j suddenly change, and the transition takes place. The absolute values of the alignment angles &thgr;j after the transition increase from the vicinity of the substrates to the center of the liquid crystal layer, and it can be seen that the liquid crystal after transition is in the bend alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> The smaller the critical electric field Ec is, the faster the alignment of the liquid crystal changes from homogenous alignment to bend alignment. With the approach described above, the critical electric field Ec was calculated for various parameters determining the alignment of the liquid crystal. As a result, it was found that the critical electric field Ec is susceptible in particular to the elastic constant (splay elastic constant) of the liquid crystal and to asymmetries of the pretilt angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> shows the result of determining the relation of the splay elastic constant k<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>and the critical electric field Ec. The results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> have been calculated setting the boundary conditions &thgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;&plus;0.1 rad, and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>np-1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&minus;0.1 rad, and with k<highlight><subscript>33</subscript></highlight>&equals;12&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn and &Dgr;&egr;&equals;10. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the larger the splay elastic constant k<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>is, the larger is the critical electric field Ec. In particular in the range of k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&gt;10&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn, Ec increases sharply with k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in order to achieve a swift liquid crystal transition, it is advantageous to set the splay elastic constant k<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>to less than 10&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn, preferably to not more than 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn. There is no particular lower limit for the splay elastic constant k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>, but it is preferable if the splay elastic constant k<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>is at least 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn, because it is usually difficult to synthesize or prepare liquid crystal materials with k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&lt;6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> There is no particular limitation with regard to the liquid crystal materials having such a splay elastic constant k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>, and suitable examples include pyrimidine type liquid crystals, dioxane type liquid crystals, and biphenyl type liquid crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> The asymmetry of the pretilt angles can be expressed by the difference (&Dgr;&thgr;) of the absolute tilt angles at the upper and lower substrates. Also, as mentioned above, the pretilt angles &thgr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>np-1 </subscript></highlight>have opposite signs, so that the difference (&Dgr;&thgr;) of the absolute values of the pretilt angles can be expressed as &Dgr;&thgr;&equals;&verbar;&thgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&thgr;<highlight><subscript>np-1</subscript></highlight>&verbar;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> Curve a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> shows the calculated relation between the difference (&Dgr;&thgr;) of the absolute values of the tilt angles at the upper and lower substrates and the critical electric field Ec. Curve a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> has been calculated for k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&equals;6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn, k<highlight><subscript>33</subscript></highlight>&equals;12&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn and &Dgr;&egr;&equals;10. Curve a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows that the larger the difference &Dgr;&thgr; of the pretilt angles is, the lower is the critical electric field Ec. In particular in a range of &Dgr;&thgr;&gE;0.0002 rad, Ec decreases sharply as &Dgr;&thgr; increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> Consequently, to achieve a swift liquid crystal transition, it is advantageous to set the difference &Dgr;&thgr; of the pretilt angles to at least 0.0002 rad, preferably to at least 0.035 rad. Furthermore, there is not particular limitation with regard to an upper limit for the difference &Dgr;&thgr; of the pretilt angles, but preferably, the difference &Dgr;&thgr; of the pretilt angles is set to less than 1.57 rad, more preferably to not more than 0.785 rad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> The absolute values of the pretilt angles &thgr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>np-1 </subscript></highlight>are preferably set to more than 0 rad and less than 1.57 rad, more preferably to at least 0.017 rad and at most 0.785 rad. The pretilt angles can be adjusted by forming suitable liquid crystal alignment films on the substrate surfaces by such methods as oblique deposition or Langmuir Blodgett (LB) deposition. There is no particular limitation with regard to the liquid crystal alignment films, and suitable examples include polyimide resins, polyvinyl alcohols, polystyrene resins, polycinnamate resins, chalcone-based resins, polypeptide resins, and polymer liquid crystals. Furthermore, in addition to the selection of the material for the liquid crystal alignment film, the pretilt angles can be controlled by adjusting such parameters as the tilt of the deposition direction with respect to the substrate surface in case of oblique deposition, or the lifting speed of the substrates in case of LB deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> The critical electric field Ec is also influenced by non-uniformities of the electric field in the liquid crystal layer, because bends of the electric field in the liquid crystal layer influence the stability of the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules. Non-uniformities in the electric field can be expressed by the ratio E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>of the main electric field E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>applied substantially uniformly to the liquid crystal layer and the secondary electric field E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>that is applied non-uniformly. Here, E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the maximum value of the applied secondary electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> The relation between the non-uniformity E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and the critical electric field Ec can be determined as follows, with the above-described approach. That is to say, the change of the alignment angles &thgr;j when increasing the main electric field E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is calculated under the condition that a uniform main electric field E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is applied as the external electric field E to the liquid crystal layer, and superimposed with a non-uniform secondary electric field E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The secondary electric field E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>increases together with the main electric field E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, so that the E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is constant at a predetermined value. From the result of the calculation, it is possible to determine the critical electric field Ec for liquid crystal transition as the main electric field E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>at which the alignment angles &thgr;j change abruptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> is an example of the calculated critical electric field Ec, calculated with the above-described approach for a varying E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. The results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> have been calculated setting the boundary conditions to &thgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;&plus;0.26 rad and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>np-1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&minus;0.25 rad, and with k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&equals;6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn, k<highlight><subscript>33</subscript></highlight>&equals;12&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7</superscript></highlight>dyn and &Dgr;&egr;&equals;10. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, the larger E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is, that is, the larger the non-uniformity of the electric field is, the larger is the critical electric field Ec, which becomes infinitely small near E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;1. It seems that this is, because when there are bends in the electric field in the liquid crystal layer, then the homogeneous alignment is more unstable than when the electric field is uniform, and as a result, the transition to the bend alignment accelerates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> Consequently, to achieve a fast liquid crystal transition, it is advantageous when the a spatially non-uniform electric field E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is applied to the liquid crystal layer together with a practically uniform main field E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. It is particularly advantageous to set 0.01&lt;E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&lt;1. In the range of E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&lE;0.01, it is difficult to attain a satisfying effect of promoting the liquid crystal transition by application of a non-uniform electric field, and in the range of E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&gE;1, the applied voltage becomes too large, so that there is the problem that it is not suitable for practical use. It is preferable to set 0.5&lE;E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&lE;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> Using the voltage applied between the source electrode of the thin film transistor and the transparent electrode, the non-uniform electric field E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>can be applied to the liquid crystal layer in a direction perpendicular to the substrates. It is preferable that the non-uniform electric field E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is an ac electric field with a frequency of at most 100 kHz, and it is preferable that its amplitude attenuates over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to satisfy a combination of two or all three of the three conditions for lowering the critical electric field Ec, namely the conditions for the splay elastic constant (k<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>), the asymmetry of the pretilt angle (&Dgr;&thgr;), and the non-uniformity of the electric field (E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>). Combining these conditions, the critical electric field Ec can be lowered even more reliably than when only one of the conditions is satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0478" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0478&rsqb;</number> For example, curve b in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> shows the result of the calculations under the same conditions as in curve a of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>, except that a non-uniform electric field E<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is applied in addition to the practically uniform external electric field E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. Curve b shows the results for E<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.03. As can be seen by comparing curve a and curve b in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>, the critical electric field Ec is lowered further, and a swifter liquid crystal transition can be achieved by satisfying a combination of the two conditions of asymmetry of the pretilt angles and electric field non-uniformity. </paragraph>
