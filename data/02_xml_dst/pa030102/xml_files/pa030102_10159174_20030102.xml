<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An electrical connector assembly has a male connector which houses and locks to a series of male bladed terminals and a female connector housing and locking to a series of female terminals. A blade of each male terminal extends into a chamber defined by a shroud of the male connector. Prior to mating of the electrical connector assembly, a self-aligning blade stabilizer is snap fitted into a pre-staged position with the male connector via a two-stage fastening feature so that the distal ends of the blades are disposed within respective apertures of the stabilizer and aligned to their respective female terminals. With the blade stabilizer held in a pre-staged position, the distal ends of the blades are protected from being inadvertently knocked and bent which would cause misalignment. Furthermore, the stabilizer prevents entry of debris into the chamber of the male connector which would hinder or prevent full mating of the electrical connector.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electrical connector assembly, and more particularly to an electrical connector assembly having a self-aligning, pre-staging, terminal blade stabilizer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A multi-bladed electrical connector has a male connector portion which firmly supports a series of male terminals that are locked within respective terminal cavities of the male connector portion. A female connector portion of the electrical connector mates typically via a snap locking feature to the male connector portion. When mating, the pins are received by respective pin receptacles of the female connector portion to form the electrical connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A blade or pin of each terminal projects forward from each terminal cavity and into a common blind bore or chamber defined by a forward projecting circumferential encasement or shroud of the male connector portion. The female connector portion of the electrical connector houses the series of pin receptacles which communicate through a leading end of the female connector portion. For a reliable electrical connection, each pin receptacle must align with its respective pin of the terminal of the male connector portion. When the electrical connector is mated, the leading end portion of the female connector portion fits into the chamber of the male connector portion and is thus guided by the circumferential encasement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, during the manufacturing phase and/or handling of a wire harness, which is engaged to the male connector portion of the electrical connector, the exposed protruding pins of the terminals can potentially be knocked or bent, or debris may enter the chamber of the male connector portion which results in the inability of the terminals to connected electronically within the pin receptacles of the female connector portions. Moreover, the manufacturing dimensional variances between the terminals and the male connector portion housing cause the terminals to pivot slightly within the housing and the distal ends of the pins to become misaligned with the receptacles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An electrical connector assembly has a male connector which houses and locks to a series of male bladed terminals and a female connector housing and locking to a series of female terminals. A blade of each male terminal extends into a chamber defined by a shroud of the male connector. Prior to mating of the electrical connector assembly, a self-aligning blade stabilizer is snap fitted into a pre-staged position with the male connector via a two-stage fastening feature so that the distal ends of the blades are disposed within respective apertures of the stabilizer and aligned to their respective female terminals. With the blade stabilizer held in a pre-staged position, the distal ends of the blades are protected from being inadvertently knocked and bent which would cause misalignment. Furthermore, the stabilizer prevents entry of debris into the chamber of the male connector which would hinder or prevent full mating of the electrical connector. During mating of the electrical connector assembly, the stabilizer is pushed out of the pre-staged position and into a staged position as the blades travel through the apertures and into the female terminals of the female connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The two-stage fastening feature is constructed and arranged between the stabilizer and the housing of the electrical connector. Preferably, the two stage fastening feature entails a protuberance which projects radially or laterally outward from a shroud of the stabilizer and a forward and rearward locking nub which projects laterally inward from the circumferential encasement of the male connector portion. The protuberance is disposed axially between the forward and rearward locking nubs when the stabilizer is in the pre-staged position and is snap fitted over the rearward locking nub when the stabilizer moves from the pre-staged position to the staged position, simultaneously, as the electrical connector is being mated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is the prevention of accidental misalignment or bending of the protruding blades of the terminals of the male connector portion. Another advantage of the present invention is the elimination of foreign article or debris collection within the chamber of the male connector portion which could prevent full mating of the electrical connector. Yet another advantage of the invention is the incorporation of a blade stabilizer having a pre-staged position without having to re-design the male or female connector of the electrical connector assembly.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, illustrate a multi-pin electrical connector assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a self-aligning, pre-staging, pin or blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which ensures reliable electrical connection of the assembly. The plastic blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed within a housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the electrical connector assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which has a first part being the plastic body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of a female connector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a second separate part being the plastic body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of a male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed axially between the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> along a mating axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rigidly engages and locks to a series of terminals <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> disposed within respective cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the male connector body which that communicates axially between a rearward face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a forward face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the male connector body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Each terminal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a pin or blade <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which projects forward from the forward face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into a blind bore or chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defined circumferentially by a shroud or circumferential encasement <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the male connector body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. When the electrical connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mated, each pin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the terminals <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extends through a respective aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and into respective female terminals or pin receptacles <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> disposed within a leading end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the female connector body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Prior to mating of the electrical connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is inserted into the chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> until it engages into a pre-staged position <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When in the pre-staged position <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, distal ends of the pins <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the terminals <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are disposed within or slightly extend forward beyond the apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> eliminates or reduces exposure of the pins <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (i.e. from 6.5 mm to 1.5 mm) which could otherwise lead to bending or mis-alignment of the pins with respect to the female connector receptacles <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Any pivoting action of the terminal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> within the cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which could lead to misalignment of the pins <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with respect to the female connector receptacles <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is also prevented when the blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in the pre-staged position <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which carries a leading surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that faces the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a trailing surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that faces the female connector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> communicate between the leading and trailing surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Each aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has a beveled peripheral edge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> carried by the leading surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to help guide the distal ends of the pins <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the respective aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A shroud <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projects axially forward from the periphery of the trailing surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, when viewed separately from the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is similar or identical to the blade stabilizer described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,879,174, issued Mar. 9, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference. However, when utilized with the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the blade stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> interacts with an integral two-stage fastening feature or indent-detent interface <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> not previously taught or described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The two-stage fastening feature <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes four protuberances <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which are spaced circumferentially about the shroud <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each protuberance <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is elongated circumferentially with respect to the shroud <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and projects laterally outward from a slight depression area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> carried by the shroud <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which extends axially. Each protuberance <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> interacts with respective forward and rearward locking nubs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which project laterally or radially inward from the circumferential encasement <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. During assembly, when the stabilizer is placed in the pre-staged position <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the protuberance <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> snap fits axially over and settles just rearward of the forward locking nub <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the shroud <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, must flex substantially radially inward and then snap radially outward to place the protuberance <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> between the forward and rearward locking nubs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> thus placing the stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the pre-staged position <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. To assist in this snap fit or flexing and adjust for manufacturing variances of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the self-aligning stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends through the plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and enables such flexing. The slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> divides the plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into a first and a second segment <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which are interconnected by flexing or web members <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which bridge the slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is elongated laterally with respect to the electrical connector assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thus matching the profile of the circumferential encasement <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to prevent rotation of the stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which would mis-align the blades <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extends longitudinally laterally with respect to the stabilizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The shroud <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> therefore has two elongated sides <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> wherein two protuberances <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are located on each elongated side. The elongated sides <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> flex radially inward toward one another as the protuberances <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> pass over the forward locking nubs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
