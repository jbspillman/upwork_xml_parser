<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a telecommunications device and, more particularly, to management of the telecommunications device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional telecommunications devices typically provide some mechanism for remotely accessing management functions for the device. A typical mechanism is a command line interface (CLI). The CLI is a user interface through which the user responds to a visual prompt from the telecommunication device by typing in a command on a specified line. The telecommunication device processes the command and returns a response to the user. At this point if the user has additional commands that the user wishes to process, the user enters the next command on the specified line in response to the visual prompt and continues in this manner until all commands or requests for management activities are entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The CLI user interface like other typical mechanisms for remotely accessing management functions for the device, such as simple network management protocol (SNMP) management station and agent, a mechanism that supports hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or other like mechanisms, require the device to provide dedicated processing operations for each mechanism the device supports. As such each mechanism is required to have a processing facility for processing the requests for management activities dedicated to each mechanism. These unique processing facilities are tailored to a user request syntax and cannot be shared amongst the various mechanisms. Accordingly, for each mechanism added to the device to support a user request syntax, a corresponding processing facility must be developed for each added mechanism. Consequently, the conventional mechanisms for remotely accessing management functions of telecommunications devices become burdensome to operate, configure, and maintain due to their overall complexity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the above-described limitations of managing a telecommunications device. The present invention provides an approach to enable the telecommunications device to communicate with a variety of parties via a variety of protocols for the purposes of device management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a telecommunications device has a management facility for managing the telecommunications device and an interface for receiving requests for performance of management activities. The management facility is responsive to the requests for performance of management activities from multiple requesters. The interface receives the requests for performance of the management activities from multiple requesters via multiple protocols and passes the requests to the management facility in a translated format that is understood by the management facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The interface is capable of receiving the requests for performance of management activities from the requesters via a network management protocol, such as the simple network management protocol (SNMP), or a web-connection via the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP). The interface may be adapted to include a server for receiving and transmitting communications via HTTP with a requester. The interface may also include an SNMP agent for receiving and transmitting communications to an SNMP manager associated with a requester and a GR-303 stack for receiving and transmitting communications with a requester via the common management information protocol/common management information service element (CMIP/CMISE) suite of protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The telecommunications device may be an integrated access platform for providing parties with access to a digital subscriber line (DSL) or to plain old telephone service (POTS) for both voice and data communications. The management facility is adaptable to transmit a response to a request for management activities in the file transfer protocol (FTP). In addition, the management facility is capable of performing multiple sessions with multiple requesters to perform multiple management activities in a substantially simultaneous manner. Moreover, the interface of the telecommunications device is extensible to add a translation facility that is capable of translating a request for management activities from a communications protocol to the format understandable to the management facility. Furthermore, the interface of the telecommunications device is flexible in that a translation facility of the interface is capable of being dropped for translating a request for management services to the format understandable to the management facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method is performed in a telecommunications device for communicating with one or more requesters to manage a portion of the telecommunications device. The telecommunications device receives multiple requests via multiple protocols from one or more requesters for managing a portion of the telecommunications device. The telecommunications device translates each request from one of the multiple protocols to another protocol understandable by a management facility of the telecommunications device. The request in the other protocol is passed to the management facility to manage a portion of the telecommunication device. In response, the management facility provides a response in the other protocol. The response in the other protocol is translated to the protocol used to communicate the request and returned via the original protocol to the requester. The telecommunications device is capable of receiving requests and transmitting responses via a variety of protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, a device readable medium holding executable instructions for a telecommunications device associated with a network that allows the device to be managed by a number of requesters submitting a number of requests via a variety of protocols is provided. The device readable medium provides a management facility to manage the telecommunications device. The management facility is responsive to the multiple requests submitted by the multiple requesters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The telecommunications device translates the multiple requests from the multiple protocols to a format suitable for the management facility to understand and transfers to the management facility the multiple requests in the format suitable for the management facility. The management facility processes the multiple requests in the format suitable for the management facility and generates a response to each of the multiple requests. The content of the response from the management facility is translated into one of the multiple protocols and is transmitted to the respective requester via the protocol suitable for the requester. In this manner multiple requesters communicating with the telecommunications device via multiple communication protocols can manage the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the present invention, a method for managing operation of a telecommunications device that provides one or more connections to a telephone network is provided. The telecommunications device includes a management facility and is interfaced with multiple client devices. The telecommunications device receives multiple requests from the client devices for performing a management operation in the telecommunications device using the management facility. Each of the requests from the client devices is received via a variety of protocols. The telecommunications device translates each request from one of the multiple protocols to another protocol understandable by the management facility. The management facility is responsive to the request in the other protocol to support management of the telecommunications device by the multiple client devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The method allows the telecommunications device to unpack each request in the other protocol for the management facility to determine an action and a response for each of the multiple requests. Each response from the management facility is formatted in the other protocol, which is then translated to one of the multiple protocols and transmitted via one of the multiple protocols to the appropriate client device to support management of the telecommunications device by the client device.</paragraph>

A suitable data structure for sending a request for management activities can be a markup language data structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a field in an SNMP datagram <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, or field in a CMIP/CMISE datagram <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. With regard to the markup language data structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the parser is concerned with fields <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C. Fields <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C are identified with field names. The fields are named in a manner to identify session variables, selected elements and other like information. The parser verifies that all fields contain a value (Step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). If no errors are present in the request for management activities, the value in each field <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C is copied to a corresponding field <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in a data structure or message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> understandable by the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). If there is an error present in the request for management activities, an error message is sent to party device that sent the request (Step <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The interface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> continues to build the message by setting a value in a field of the message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> named message ID, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and by setting a value in a field of the message named request ID <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> identifies what type of management activity is contained in the message, that is, the message ID identifies to the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> the type of task that the party is requesting. The value held in the request ID field <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> identifies the interface component that built the message. The value inserted in the message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is determined from the context of the request submitted by party device. For example, if the party devices <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> submit a request for management activities via the web server <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the web server <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> recognizes from the context of the requested content by the party devices <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that the request pertains to a specific type of management activity or task. As such, if the user of the party device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> selects content from the web server <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that relates to administration tasks, the web server <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> upon receipt of the request for management services is able to identify that the request for management services relates to the downloaded administration content and sets the message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to a value that indicates a request for administration tasks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In similar fashion, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the GR-303 stack <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are able to determine from a received request for management activity the type of activity or task requested and set the message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the message they build to a value that indicates the type of task requested. The SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> identifies from the request for management activities the type field <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of SNMP datagram <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> along with assorted variable bindings, such as instance and object identifiers (OID&apos;s) also contained in the SNMP datagram <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> submitted by SNMP manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> uses the command type, the variable bindings and the OID to set the value of the message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> when building a message for the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In addition, if the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> recognizes that the appropriate command is set in the type field <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> copies the content of the value field <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> into the data field <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The GR-303 stack <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, like the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, identifies the CMIP/CMISE command in the type field <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to set the value of the message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> when building a message for the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In addition, if the GR-303 stack <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> recognizes that the appropriate command is set in the type field <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the GR-303 stack <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> copies the content of the value field <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> into the data field <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The interface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is responsible for sequencing the message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in a logical sequence to the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for processing (Step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the web server <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or the GR-303 stack <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, includes a value in the request ID field <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for later use in determining which interface component is the originator of the message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, upon receipt of a message <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the web server <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or the GR-303 stack <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, also examines the message ID field <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to route the message to an appropriate one of the processors in the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>D, and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A for processing (Step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The various processors available in the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for processing of the message is discussed below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The appropriate processor within the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> processes the requested management activity and returns a response <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the format understandable by the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> reads the request ID field <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in the response <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to identify which component of the interface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> should receive the response <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and forwards the response <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> thereto for translation into a format understandable by the party device requesting the management activity (Step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The responsible interface component then copies a value from each of the data fields <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> from the response <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to a corresponding field in a response data structure suitable for sending to a requester (Step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Upon translating the response <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to a format understandable by the requester the interface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transmits the response to the party device via the appropriate protocol (Step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the management facility <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in more detail. A task router <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in communication with the interface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is responsible for routing the requests for management activities from each of the parties to the appropriate processor for processing based on the message ID in the message. The task router <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> routes the message from the interface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to either the administration task processor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A, the configuration task processor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B, the debug task processor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>C, the test task processor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>D, and the status task processor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A to process the request for management activity from the party device. If necessary to process the request of management activity, each of the processors <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>D, and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A can communicate with an alarm and message task processor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to process an alarm and message related task.
