</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an image receiving sheet for forming non-fixed images on which a toner image can be removably formed without being fixed thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Image forming methods for forming a toner image on an image receiving sheet are known for long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A typical example is an electrophotographic image forming method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the electrophotographic image forming method, an electrostatic latent image carrier such as a photosensitive member is charged to a predetermined potential, and image exposure is effected in the charged region of electrostatic latent image carrier to form an electrostatic latent image on the carrier according to the original image information. Then the electrostatic latent image is developed into a visible toner image by a developer. The visible toner image on the electrostatic latent image carrier is transferred onto an image receiving sheet and is fixed thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other proposed image forming methods include a method in which toner is directly adhered to an image receiving sheet in accordance with the original image information, whereby a toner image is formed and fixed thereto, and a method in which a toner image is directly formed on an intermediate transfer member in a similar manner, is transferred to an image receiving sheet and is fixed thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In any case, the toner fixed to an image receiving sheet can not be easily separated from the image receiving sheet, and therefore reuse of the toner and image receiving sheet is difficult. Thus nowadays, image receiving sheets having the toner images fixed thereto are cast away if they become unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, with the spread of computerization, large amounts of toner and image receiving sheets are consumed, and the energy required for the production of them as well as a carbon dioxide gas discharged thereby have been increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A deinking method using an aqueous solution of a surface active agent is known for separating the toner from the image receiving sheet to reuse the image receiving sheets having the toner images fixed thereto. However, the deinking method needs a large quantity of energy for removing the water penetrated into image receiving sheets such as paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.2000-250249 proposed an image forming method of a non-fixing type for forming a toner image on an image receiving sheet, and an image receiving sheet to be used for implementing such method. The proposed image receiving sheet has an irregular surface including concavities for receiving the toner, and ridges for protecting the toner adhering to the concavities. A toner image is formed as the desired image on the irregular surface of the image receiving sheet by removably adhering the toner to the concavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the above-proposed image forming method of a non-fixing type and the image receiving sheet, a toner image is formed and retained such that the toner can be separated and removed from the image receiving sheet without being fixed thereto as conventionally done. Thus the toner and/or the image receiving sheet can be reused by separating the toner from the image receiving sheet having the toner image formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, the image receiving sheet disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.2000-250249 posed problems. If the ridges for protecting the toner adhering to the concavities have insufficient strength, the ridges would be likely to easily fall or collapse by external force exerted on the sheet, thereby becoming unable to satisfactorily protect the toner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If the ridges are feeble, the toner on the image receiving sheet would stick to our finger or the like. Further, when the image receiving sheets having the toner image formed thereon are discharged by a discharge roller, the ridges would fall or deform to an exceeding extent, thereby causing damage to images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Feeble ridges raised other problems. For example, when the image receiving sheets are pulled out and fed, one by one, by a sheet-feeding device from a supply cassette accommodating the sheets as piled up, the sheet-feeding device exerts a strong action on the ridges, thereby collapsing the ridges and causing damage to them. In this case, it is difficult to form a good toner image on the image receiving sheet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the image receiving sheets of the invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheets to be described below are those for forming a toner image basically by removably adhering toner, the sheet having an irregular surface including a large number of concavities in the form of continuous grooves for receiving the toner and ridges capable of protecting the toner adhering to the concavities. A toner image can be formed by removably adhering the toner to the concavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> (1) First Type Image Receiving Sheet and Second Type Image Receiving Sheet </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the first type image receiving sheet, the continuously grooved concavities have a depth (height of ridges) of 20 &mgr;m to 150 &mgr;m; and a condition of E&middot;A&gE;2 &lsqb;GPa&middot;&mgr;m&rsqb; can be established wherein E&lsqb;GPa&rsqb; means Young&apos;s modulus and A &lsqb;&mgr;m&rsqb; means a width of ridges. Young&apos;s modulus is a value given when a material for forming the concavities and ridges is elongated by 1%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Since the continuously grooved concavities have a depth (height of ridges) of 20 &mgr;m to 150 &mgr;m, the toner can be properly adhered to the concavities in forming a toner image and the toner adhering thereto can be protected by the ridges. The ridges of the image receiving sheet are formed along the concavities to provide the grooved concavities therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Because the material for forming the concavities and ridges of the image receiving sheet fulfill the condition of E&middot;A&gE;2 &lsqb;GPa&middot;&mgr;m&rsqb;, the ridges on the sheet would be unlikely to fall or deform to an exceeding extent when handled as usual with our fingers. In view of these features, a toner image can be properly formed and the toner image thus formed can be suitably retained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the irregular surface is formed by an impressing block (impressing roller) as done in the methods 1 and 2, the irregular surface may be formed by pressing a roller having an irregular surface pattern against an opposite roller as opposed to the roller having the irregular surface pattern so as to form a sheet surface curved along the opposite roller. In the method 5, the surface of the impressing block may be so contoured at a specified curvature that the irregular surface is inwardly curved. Thereby the obtained image receiving sheet can be suppressed from curling. The other side than the irregular surface of the sheet may be coated with a resin, fine particles or the like to prevent the sheet from curling.

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> First, a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fed by a pair of feed rollers Rs<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the cooling roller Ro<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ascends an upper portion of the roller Ro<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> along the roller Ro<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a molten resin Ju&prime; injected from the T-die Td<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is allowed to continuously adhere to the surface of sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on reaching the highest point of the roller Ro<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, the resin layer is cured and the completed image receiving sheet is discharged by a pair of discharge rollers Rs<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(A) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(C) schematically show a still further example of the method for producing an image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The method for producing an image receiving sheet which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(A) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(C) employs an impressing block Hg having an irregular surface pattern which is reverse in positions of concavities and ridges to that of an image receiving sheet to be produced; and a hot press HP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> For example, the impressing block Hg is produced by forming continuously grooved concavities U on a silicone wafer by dicer processing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(A)). A laminate sheet comprising a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a resin Ju&Prime; deposited on a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed on a base Di with the resin Ju&Prime; facing up. The impressing block Hg is superimposed on the laminate sheet with the concavities U of the block facing the resin. Then, the laminate sheet is heated and pressed by a hot press placed on the impressing block Hg. An image receiving layer is formed by impressing an irregular surface pattern of the impressing block Hg on the layer of the resin Ju&Prime; to form an irregular surface having concavities and ridges defined reversely to those in the irregular pattern of the block Hg (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(B)). The hot press HP and the impressing block HG are removed and the image receiving sheet S is taken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The impressing block may be formed of a material such as metal, which is unlikely to deform by heating or pressing, instead of the silicon wafer. An impressing block may be produced by forming continuously grooved concavities on a plate of metal by dicer processing and impressing the pattern on silicone rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> schematically shows an additional example of the method for producing an image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The method for producing an image receiving sheet which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> employs a heat-molding roller RL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having an irregular surface pattern on the surface; a resin coater Co for coating the surface of a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the side of roller RL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a photocurable resin; a heating-pressing roller Ro<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for heating and pressing the sheet; and a light-irradiating device Lp for curing a layer of photocurable resin having an irregular surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> First, one surface of the sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is substantially uniformly coated by the coater Co with a photocurable resin, and is fed between the heating-pressing roller Ro<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the heat-molding roller RL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by a pair of feed roller Rs<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The side of the sheet substrate is heated and pressed by the roller Ro<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and concavities and ridges are formed on the surface of the resin layer by pressing the irregular surface of the roller RL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> against the surface of the resin layer while heating the side of the resin layer by the roller RL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The resin layer having the irregular surface is irradiated with light rays by the light-irradiating device Lp to cure the resin layer, whereby an image receiving sheet is produced and is discharged by the paired discharge rollers Rs<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The light rays to be emitted by the light-irradiating device Lp can be any of visible light, UV light and the like which can cure the resin. It is possible to use a resin which is curable by electron rays instead of photocurable resins. In this case, an electron rays-irradiating device is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(A) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(B) schematically show another example of the method for producing an image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The method for producing an image receiving sheet which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(A) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(B) employs a light-irradiating device Lp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for curing the photocurable resin; a light-intercepting mask Mk having a specified transparent pattern and capable of intercepting the light emitted from the light-irradiating device Lp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; and a cleaning device (not shown) for removing the undesired resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> First, a layer Lj of photocurable resin is deposited on the surface of sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(A)). The light-intercepting mask Mk is laid on the resin layer Lj to shield surface portions of the layer Lj for forming concavities from light emitted from the light-irradiating device Lp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Light is shed from the side of the light-intercepting mask Mk by the light-irradiating device Lp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to cure the surface portions of the resin layer Lj for forming the ridges. Thereafter the mask Mk is detached and the uncured resin is removed by the cleaning device (not shown) using a cleaning agent (such as water) to finish the image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing examples of methods for producing an image receiving sheet, it is possible to use biodegradable resins, resins curable on vaporization of a solvent or the like which are employable in the methods, although thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, photocurable resins and the like are mainly used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet having an irregular surface can be prevented from curling in the following manner. The impressing roller for forming an irregular surface may be pressed on the surface of the sheet as done in the above methods but such that the surface is curved along the roller opposed to the roller having the irregular surface pattern. Optionally the irregular surface of the impressing roller may be inwardly curved at a specified curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The surface of the sheet which does not have the irregular surface may be coated with a resin or fine particles to suppress the curling of the sheet. If these two measures are both taken, a higher effect of preventing the curling of the sheet is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In the methods for producing an image receiving sheet, if necessary, a margin portion Mj (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) without an uneven surface may be arranged at least in a portion of a peripheral area of the image receiving sheet. When required, a filler may be incorporated into a resin material before deposition or injection of the resin on the sheet substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing methods for producing an image receiving sheet, a laminate sheet comprising a sheet substrate and a resin layer is used. The structure of the image receiving sheet is not limited to a 2-layer laminate. The image receiving sheet may be comprised of more than 2 layers or a single layer insofar as these methods permit the production of such image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a schematic structure of an example of an image forming apparatus for forming a non-fixed image on the image receiving sheet of the non-fixing type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> An image forming apparatus AP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is provided with a ridge-cleaning device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for removing the toner adhering to the ridges of the irregular surface of the image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The image forming apparatus AP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also provided with a toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for forming a toner image on an image receiving sheet S and with a sheet-cleaning device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for removing the toner images formed on the image receiving sheet before forming images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When an image is formed on the irregular surface of the image receiving sheet by the image forming apparatus AP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the image receiving sheet is transported on a specified sheet-transporting path as guided by a guide member G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the like. The image receiving sheet is carried from, for example, a sheet tray (not shown) for accommodating a plurality of the image receiving sheets toward a discharge tray (not shown) for accommodating image receiving sheets having image(s) formed thereon while image(s) is(are) formed on running image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet is transported at a specified speed by pairs of rollers r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to r<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> provided in positions opposed to the sheet-transporting path. When image receiving sheet is transported, the pairs of rollers r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to r<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are driven to rotate in a predetermined direction at a specified speed via a driving force transmitting mechanism such as a mechanism including a gear train and/or a belt (not shown) by a motor MT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment. A photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a transfer roller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are driven to rotate via a driving force transmitting mechanism (not shown) by the motor MT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet being carried at the predetermined sheet-transporting speed in this way is successively subjected to a cleaning processing by the sheet-cleaning device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, subjected to a toner image forming processing by the toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and subjected to a ridge-cleaning processing by the ridge-cleaning device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in this order. Description is given below about operations of devices in forming an image on the image receiving sheet S shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet S is subjected to the following cleaning processing by the sheet-cleaning device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The sheet-cleaning device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is adapted to remove the toner adhering to the concavities and ridges of the irregular surface of the image receiving sheet. Toner image(s) may be already formed on the irregular surface of the image receiving sheet. The toner image(s) is(are) removed from the irregular surface of the sheet, whereby the sheet is made ready for the formation of images by the toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The sheet-cleaning device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has an electrically conductive brush roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> connected to a power source PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a grounded platen roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The brush roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is supplied with a bias voltage having a polarity opposite to the charged polarity (negative polarity in this embodiment) of toner T on the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S from a power source PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The toner T adhering to the ridges P and concavities R of the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S (mainly the toner adhering to the concavities R) can be removed by the electrostatic force derived from the bias voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The charged toner on the image receiving sheet S can be easily removed by electrostatic force. The toner can be so easily removed because the toner forming the toner image is merely adhered to the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S without being fixed thereto. Because of this feature, the image receiving sheet S can be repeatedly reused for formation of images. The toner removed from the image receiving sheet S may be reused for formation of toner images by the toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> After removal of the toner from the image receiving sheet S, a toner image is formed on the image receiving sheet by the toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can form a toner image on the image receiving sheet by electrophotographic method. The toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is surrounded with a charger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an exposing device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a developing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a transfer device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a cleaning device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> When a toner image is formed on the image receiving sheet S, the surface of the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is uniformly charged by the charger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a predetermined potential, i.e. about &minus;900V in this embodiment. Then, the charged surface of the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is exposed according to an original image information by the exposing device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (laser device in this embodiment) to reduce the potential of the exposed surface portion of the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the potential of the surface portion of the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> irradiated with light rays is reduced to about &minus;100V in this embodiment. Thereby an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the original image information is formed on the surface of the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A toner image corresponding to the original image information is formed on the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by developing the electrostatic latent image using the charged toner of the predetermined polarity (negatively charged toner in this embodiment) by the developing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the developing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a developing bias voltage (about &minus;350V in this embodiment) is applied to a developing roller <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> carrying the charged toner, whereby the electrostatic latent image is developed. The toner image formed on the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transferred to the image receiving sheet S by the transfer device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a transfer roller <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> opposed to the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this operation, the transfer roller <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is supplied with a transfer bias voltage having a polarity opposite to the charged polarity (negative polarity in this embodiment) of toner T on the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The toner image on the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is electrostatically transferred to the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S by the bias voltage. The toner remaining on the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without being transferred is removed from the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a cleaning blade <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the cleaning device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The toner removed from the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be reused for development (formation of toner image by the toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) by the developing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> When a toner image is formed in this way on the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S, the toner image may be formed in positions corresponding to ridges of the irregular surface. In this case, the toner is allowed to adhere to the ridges. The toner adhering to ridges P is easily transferred to another object (our fingers, another image receiving sheet or the like) on contact of the sheet with the object and is liable to smear the object. To suppress this possibility, the toner adhering to the ridges is removed by the ridge-cleaning device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The ridge-cleaning device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a platen roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> both disposed in positions confronting the sheet-transporting path. These rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are disposed in predetermined places. The rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are both metallic rollers and are grounded in this embodiment. The image receiving sheet S is allowed to pass between the rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. During passage, the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the tops of ridges P of the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S to thereby remove the toner from the ridges P of the image receiving sheet S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In removing the toner adhering to the ridges P of the image receiving sheet S (in cleaning the ridges), the image receiving sheet S is fed at the predetermined sheet-transporting speed by a driving device including the motor MT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Since the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed in the predetermined place, the image receiving. sheet S is allowed to move at the predetermined sheet-transporting speed relatively to the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In addition, the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> including the ridges P of the image receiving sheet S is allowed to move at the predetermined surface-moving speed (&equals;predetermined sheet-transporting speed) relatively to the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> When the ridges are cleaned, the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate in a predetermined direction at a predetermined speed. The cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate by the motor MT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the driving force transmitting mechanism (not shown). Thereby the surface of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in contact with the image receiving sheet is permitted to move in a predetermined direction at a predetermined surface-moving speed in cleaning the ridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be driven to rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. More specifically, the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be driven to rotate clockwise in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and the roller surface may be moved in a direction opposite to the sheet feed direction in a region in which the roller surface is held in contact with the image receiving sheet. Alternatively the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be driven to rotate counterclockwise in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and the roller surface may be moved in the same direction as the sheet feed direction in a region wherein the roller surface is held in contact with the image receiving sheet. The platen roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be drivenly rotated, for example, according to the movement of the image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The roller surface of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is driven to rotate in the predetermined direction as described above is brought into contact with the ridges P of the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet S which is carried in the predetermined direction in a manner to rub the ridges P with the roller surface, whereby the toner T adhering to the ridges P is removed. The toner removed from the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be reused for forming a toner image by the toner image forming device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the ridge-cleaning method and device, in any case of moving the surface of the cleaning roller in the same direction as the moving direction (i.e., the sheet feed direction in this embodiment) of the surface of the image receiving sheet or in an opposite direction, a difference of the speed is made between the moving speed of the surface (in contact with the image receiving sheet) of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the moving speed of the surface of the image receiving sheet. Typically the moving speed of the surface of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is made greater than the moving speed of the surface of the image receiving sheet. In the image forming apparatus AP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the difference of the speed between the moving speed of the surface of the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the moving speed of the surface of the image receiving sheet can be achieved by adjusting the relationship between a speed reducing ratio in the driving force transmitting mechanism for supply of the force from the motor MT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the paired rollers r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to r<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for transporting the image receiving sheet and a speed reducing ratio in the driving force transmitting mechanism for supply of the force from the motor MT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for rotationally driving the cleaning roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The difference of the speed achieved in this way permits removal of the toner from the ridges while suppressing the disturbance of toner image formed of the toner adhering to the concavities of the image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the image receiving sheet S is transported in a direction perpendicular to the extending direction of ridges P. The image receiving sheet S may be optionally transported in the extending direction of ridges P. The ridges can be cleaned more properly when the image receiving sheet S is transported in the extending direction of ridges P than when the image receiving sheet S is transported in a direction perpendicular to the extending direction of ridges P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> While the toner constituting the toner image(s) is fitted in concavities R of the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet, the toner image formed on the image receiving sheet S is protected by the ridges of the irregular surface. Consequently, unless an extraordinary external force is exerted, the toner image formed on the image receiving sheet can retain the required state of the toner image although the toner image formed thereon is merely adhered to the image receiving sheet without being fixed thereto by heating as done in conventional image forming methods. When looking at toner images on the image receiving sheet, or storing or merely moving the image receiving sheet, the image receiving sheets may be brought into contact with each other, or our finger may slightly touch the image receiving sheet. Such slight external force would be unlikely to cause undesirable incidents such as marked disturbance of toner images and adhesion of the toner to the rear side of overlaid image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Moreover, merely the toner is removably adhered to the image receiving sheet and can be separated and removed therefrom so that the removed toner and the image receiving sheet without the toner can be reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Experiments for forming images on an image receiving sheet were carried out. Experimental Examples are as follows. Thirty four kinds of samples having ridges of different widths A (&mgr;m) and different heights C (&mgr;m), and concavities of different widths B (&mgr;m) were prepared from various materials for forming an irregular surface. Each sample was prepared by the following methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> (Sample 1 to Sample 14) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Sample 1 to Sample 14 are image receiving sheets S of a non-fixing type formed of low density polyethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> First, impressing blocks for forming an irregular surface of the image receiving sheet were produced. Each of the impressing blocks was a silicon wafer on which a plurality of continuous grooves in a regular arrangement were formed by dicer processing. A plurality of impressing blocks were prepared for each sample. Each impressing block had a plurality of continuous grooves formed with a width of 5 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m, a pitch of 20 &mgr;m to 500 &mgr;m, and a depth of 20 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Then, pellets of low density polyethylene (density&equals;0.92, manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Co.) were melted and kneaded at 180&deg; C. and made into a plate. The plate was heated to 160&deg; C. and pressed at 30 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>by a hot press, whereby an unstretched film of low density polyethylene (40 &mgr;m in thickness) was prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In preparing Samples 5 and 10, 5.0 wt % of titanium oxide was added as a filler in melting and kneading the pellets. In preparing Sample 6, 3.0 wt % of carbon fiber was added as a filler in melting and kneading the pellets as done in the foregoing two samples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Sample 26 to Sample 34 are image receiving sheets of a non-fixing type formed of a curable resin (epoxy resin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Impressing blocks for forming an irregular surface of the image receiving sheet were produced. First, mother dies for forming a plurality of continuous grooves in a regular arrangement were produced on a metallic plate by dicer processing. A plurality of mother dies were provided with continuous grooves which had a width of 5 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m, a pitch of 20 &mgr;m to 500 &mgr;m and a depth of 20 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m. Impressing blocks for forming continuous grooves were produced by impressing the pattern of the mother dies on a silicone resin (TSE-350/CE-62, product of GE Toshiba Silicones). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> An epoxy resin (product of Epoch Co., Ltd.) was mixed with a curing agent in a mixing ratio of 2/1 (epoxy resin/curing agent) and stirred. In preparing Sample 34, 2.0 wt % of glass fiber was added as the filler in stirring the mixture of epoxy resin and curing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The uniformly stirred mixture of epoxy resin and curing agent or the uniformly stirred mixture of epoxy resin, curing agent and filler was applied to RC paper (Mitsubishi Paper Mills, Ltd.) of A4 size by a bar coater. The impressing block made of silicone resin was superimposed on the sheet. Thereafter the sheet was left to stand as pressed at 60&deg; C. and 10 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for 24 hours, whereby a sample made of epoxy resin having an irregular surface was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Young&apos;s modulus at 1% elongation of the sample of epoxy resin having the irregular surface was measured according to the above-described Young&apos;s modulus measuring method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> A width A (&mgr;m) of ridges of irregular surface of the sheet, a width B (&mgr;m) of concavities thereof, and a depth C (&mgr;m) of concavities (height of ridges) thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(B)) were measured by a laser displacement meter of non-contact type. Table 5 shows the values A, B and C and Young&apos;s modulus of each of Samples 26 to 34.

In other words, a preferred image receiving sheet for forming a non-fixed image is one which can fulfill the relationship of Young&apos;s modulus E X the width A of ridges &gE;2&lsqb;GPa&middot;&mgr;m&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> (2) Third Type Image Receiving Sheet </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The third type image receiving sheet has the same basic structure as above except that the ridges are reinforced with a reinforcing portion for keeping the posture of ridges (for maintaining the posture of ridges in which the ridges are unlikely to fall or buckle) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> If the depth of concavities in the form of continuous grooves (height of ridges) is too small, the toner adhering to the concavities tends to peel off, whereas if the depth is too large, the toner is difficult to adhere to the concavities in forming images. In view of this tendency, a suitable depth is about 30 &mgr;m to about 150 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing portion may be formed continuously or intermittently in the lengthwise direction of ridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Typical examples of the reinforcing portion are those of the type (1) and the type (2) as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> (1) The reinforcing portion may be at least a lower portion of the ridge adjacent to the bottom portion of the concavity, the lower portion of the ridge being thicker than an upper portion of the ridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Such ridges including the reinforcing portions are trapezoidal, triangular, conical like Mt.Fuji, hemielliptical or hemispheric in section. The reinforcing portion may take the form of a half of a symmetrical section shape. In the latter case, the reinforcing portion is formed only on one side of the ridge. The reinforcing portion shows a low effect if the difference of thickness is small between a lower portion of the ridge or a lower end thereof and an upper portion thereof or an upper end thereof. Consequently the lower portion of the ridge is preferably thicker by at least 1.2 times than the upper portion of the ridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In any case, the bottom portion of the concavity and the reinforcing portion adjacent thereto form a concavely curved surface to facilitate the removal of the toner from the concavities for reuse of the image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> If the radius of curvature in the concavely curved surface is too small, only a low effect of reinforcement is expected. Therefore, the radius of the curvature is preferably 15 &mgr;m or more, more preferably 30 &mgr;m or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> (2) The reinforcing portion may be at least a portion of an upper end portion of the ridge which is thicker than an upper portion of the ridge existing downward of the upper end portion of the ridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Such reinforcing portion is preferably in the form of a convexly curved shape in outline such as circular or elliptical shape to prevent the toner, for example, from being engaged in the reinforcing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing portion of the type 1 or 2 may be formed continuously or intermittently in the lengthwise direction of the ridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Other examples of the reinforcing portion are as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing portion may be a portion ascending from the bottom portion of concavity, the ascending portion being formed between neighboring ridges having the concavity therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> While an upper end of the ascending portion may be at the same level as upper ends of the ridges, the upper end of the ascending portion may be at a lower level than the upper ends of the ridges to facilitate removal of toner from the concavities for reuse of image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> At any rate, when the ascending portion is formed, the bottom portion of the concavity and a lower portion of the ridge adjacent thereto may be in the form of a concavely curved surface in outer outline to facilitate removal of toner from the concavities for reuse of the image receiving sheet and to reinforce the ridges of image receiving sheet. Further, the bottom portion of the concavity and a lower portion of the ascending portion adjacent thereto may be in the form of a concavely curved surface in outer outline for the same reason. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> For forming any type of the reinforcing portion, thermoplastic resins and/or curable resins which are curable by a specified treatment can be used at least as the material for forming the concavities and the ridges reinforced by the reinforcing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Usable as thermoplastic resins and curable resins are the examples already given concerning the first type image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The photopolymerization initiator to be used when a photocurable resin is used is as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Materials for forming concavities and ridges may include, for example, biodegradable resins which are degraded on contact with water or bacteria when buried in the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Examples of useful biodegradable resins are chemosynthetic resins, microorganism-producing resins and natural resins. Among them, it is preferred to use natural resins having a chemical structure like that of the raw material for paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Materials for forming concavities and ridges may include, for example, polymers which can be disolved in a solvent and solidified on vaporization of the solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Examples of such polymers solidifiable on vaporization of the solvent are epoxy resins, acrylic resins, urethane resins, urethane-urea resins, cellulose derivatives and the like. These polymers can be used either alone or in combination. A curing agent may be added to these resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In any case, materials for forming concavities and ridges may include, for example, materials containing at least one kind of fillers. The addition of fillers to the polymer resin can upgrade the properties of the polymer resin due to the filler. The filler is incorporated into the material for forming concavities and ridges preferably in an amount of about 0.5 wt. % to about 50 wt. %. The filler may be substantially uniformly dispersed in the material for forming concavities and ridges or may be allowed to exist locally close to the surface of ridges and concavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Useful fillers include the examples given hereinbefore concerning the first type image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> At any rate, the filler may be subjected to surface-modifying treatment such as silane-coupling treatment, titanate-coupling treatment or the like to increase the affinity for polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> At least one kind of additives such as antistatic agents, stabilizers and surface tension adjusting agents and the like may be added to the polymer or like materials for forming concavities and ridges. The additives or like materials may be, for example, dispersed uniformly in the material. The antistatic agents, stabilizers and surface tension adjusting agents may be applied to the irregular surface after formation of the irregular surface from the material such as polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet may comprise a sheet substrate layer and a layer formed thereon from the material for forming the concavities and ridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The sheet substrate layer may be, for example, papers or films. Useful papers are, for example, wood-free plain paper, regenerated paper, recycled paper and RC paper coated with polyethylene or like resins, the paper having a basis weight of about 25 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to about 250 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Useful films are, for example, polyethylene films, polypropylene films, polyethylene terephthalate films, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> A margin portion free of concavities and ridges may be formed at least at a portion of a peripheral area of the sheet surface including an irregular surface. The image receiving sheet having such margin portion belongs to the second type image receiving sheet of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> If such margin portion is formed on the image receiving sheet, the image receiving sheet can be handled by use of the margin portion without contact with the irregular surface. Thereby damage to the ridges can be suppressed to allow more suitable formation of images. Further it is possible to prevent the damage of toner image in the image receiving sheet having the toner image formed thereon and to inhibit the adhesion of toner to our fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The margin portion may be preferably formed at least in a region wherein a sheet-feeding device exerts a strong action on the image receiving sheet when each sheet is pulled out and fed by the sheet-feeding device from the accumulated sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned image receiving sheet can be produced, for example, by the methods described hereinbefore concerning the first type image receiving sheet. In the case of an image receiving sheet having an ascending reinforcing portion in the concavity, a mesh material may be adhered to the sheet substrate. In this case, preferred mesh materials include, for example, those composed of chemosynthetic fibers, semi-chemosynthetic fibers, natural fibers or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Image formation on the third type image receiving sheet can be done by the method and apparatus for forming a non-fixed image on the sheet as described hereinbefore concerning the first type image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> On the third type image receiving sheet, image(s) can be formed such that a toner image is removably retained without being fixed to the sheet as conventionally done. Consequently the toner image can be separated and removed for reuse. Moreover, a toner image can be suitably formed on the image receiving sheet and can be properly retained thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Specific examples of the third type image receiving sheet will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(B) are a perspective view showing a portion of an example of the third type image receiving sheet and an enlarged section view of the image receiving sheet, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet S comprises a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of paper and an image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> composed of a synthetic resin on one surface of the substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(B). The image receiving sheet S is in a white color as a whole. The letter T represents the toner in an enlarge size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has continuously grooved concavities R for accommodating the toner T and ridges P for protecting the toner accommodated in the concavities R. In the sheet S, the concavities R and ridges P of the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed in parallel with a sheet feed direction Y (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A)). The sheet feed direction Y is a direction in which the sheet is transported in forming a non-fixed image on the image receiving sheet S as described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> If the depth of the concavity R (height of the ridge) is too small, the toner T adhering to the concavities is apt to peel off, whereas if it is too large, it is difficult to adhere the toner to the concavities R in forming images. Therefore, the height C of the ridge is suitably in the range of about 30 &mgr;m to about 150 &mgr;m. The range of the height C is the same in other examples of the image receiving sheet described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> In the ridges P of the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a width A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of lower portion Pd is thicker than a width A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of upper portion Pu, and the portion providing the thicker wall of the lower portion Pd forms reinforcing portions H to prevent the ridges P from causing deformation such as falling and buckling. However, if the difference of thickness is small between the width A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the upper portion Pu and the width A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lower portion Pd, the reinforcing portions H can achieve only a low effect of preventing the deformation of ridge P. Thus, the relationship of A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&gE;1.2&middot;A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> preferably exists between the width A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the upper portion and the width A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lower portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> In the image receiving sheet S, an average width B of concavities R in the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is about 15 &mgr;m to about 400 &mgr;m; an average width A of ridges P is about 5 &mgr;m to about 50 &mgr;m; and an average depth C of concavities R (height of the ridge P) is about 30 &mgr;m to about 150 &mgr;m. The average width A of ridges P is in the range of &frac12; to {fraction (1/50)} the average width B of concavities R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet S has the concavities R and ridges P uniformly disposed on the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The total area occupied by the concavities R in the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is greater than the total area occupied by the ridges P. The depth and width of concavities R are greater than the average particle size of the toner and are sufficient to receive a plurality of toner particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The illustrated image receiving sheet S is a two-layer laminate sheet comprising a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on the sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet in this embodiment has a white color although not limited thereto and may have other color corresponding to the color of toner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Materials for forming the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (materials forming the ridges and concavities) are, for example, the above-described thermoplastic resins and/or curable resins which are curable by specified treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Materials for forming the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include, for example, biodegradable resins which are degraded on contact with water or bacteria when buried in the soil. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The filler may be subjected to surface-modifying treatment such as silane-coupling treatment, titanate-coupling treatment or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> At least one kind of additives such as antistatic agents, stabilizers and surface tension adjusting agents and the like may be added to the material for forming the image receiving layer S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The additives may be applied to the irregular surface after formation of the irregular surface. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>(B), the image receiving sheet Sa has the same basic structure as the image receiving sheet S of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A). That is, it comprises a sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of paper and an image receiving layer Sa<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of synthetic resin on one surface of the sheet substrate S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and has a white color as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The image receiving layer Sa<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has concavely curved surfaces Ow formed by the ridges P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and bottom portions Rf<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of concavities R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for accommodating the toner T. The concavely curved surface Ow includes a reinforcing portion H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which serves to prevent the ridge P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from deforming such as collapsing and buckling as is the case with the ridge P having a lower portion of greater thickness in the image receiving sheet S of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(A). However, if the concavely curved surface Ow has a small radius r of curvature, the reinforcing portion can achieve only a low effect. Accordingly the desirable radius r of curvature of concavely curved surface Ow is in the range of preferably r&gE;15 &mgr;m, more preferably r&gE;25 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> When the ridges P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the bottom portions Rf<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of concavities R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> form concavely curved surfaces, the toner can be easily removed by means for removing the toner T, as compared with the concavities R of the image receiving sheet S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The shape of ridges of the image receiving sheet is not limited to the above shapes, and may be, for example, triangular, conical like Mt.Fuji, hemielliptical or hemispheric in sectional shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Concavely curved surfaces may be formed by the lower portions of the ridges having the above-mentioned various sectional shapes in combination with the bottom portions of concavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> The ridges may be formed in the form of a half of symmetrical section (including the two examples of sectional shapes described above). In this case, a reinforcing portion may be formed only on one side of the ridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing portion may be different in section on the left side and on the right side of the ridge. For example, the right side of the ridge may be hemi-trapezoidal in section while the left side has a sectional shape of concavely curved surface. In this case, the reinforcing portions on the right and left sides achieve different effects. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> The image receiving sheet Sd has concavities R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for accommodating the toner T, ridges P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for protecting the toner T accommodated in the concavities R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and reinforcing portions H<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of hemispheric sectional shape formed in a lower portion of each of the ridges P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as separated from each other by the ridge P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> The ridges PS pass through the center of the reinforcing portions H<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are intermittently arranged with a pitch PT&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(C)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing portions H<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet Sd have a hemispheric sectional shape although not limited thereto and can be any shape insofar as the fall of ridges <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is prevented. Useful shapes include, for example, shapes of rectangular paralellopiped, square cone and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(A) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(C), reinforcing portions for reinforcing different ridges are aligned together in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of ridges. The alignment of the reinforcing portions is not limited thereto insofar as the reinforcing portions so aligned can satisfactorily prevent the deformation of ridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Images can be formed on the image receiving sheet having reinforcing portions by, e.g., the image forming apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> The toner constituting the toner image formed on the image receiving sheet S is fitted in the concavities R of the irregular surface S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the image receiving sheet and is protected by the ridges P of the irregular surface. The toner image is formed on the image receiving sheet by merely adhering the toner to the image receiving sheet without being fixed thereto by heating as done in conventional image forming methods. Nevertheless the toner image so formed can be retained in the desired state unless an extraordinary external force is exerted on the image receiving sheet. When looking at toner images on the image receiving sheet, or storing or merely moving the image receiving sheet, the image receiving sheets may be brought into contact with each other, or our finger may slightly touch the image receiving sheet. Such slight external force would be unlikely to cause undesirable incidents such as marked disturbance of toner images and adhesion of the toner to the rear side of overlaid image receiving sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Moreover, merely the toner is removably adhered to the image receiving sheet and can be separated and removed therefrom so that the removed toner and the image receiving sheet with the toner removed can be reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Experiments were carried out for forming images on the image receiving sheet as described in the following Experiment Examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Eight kinds of image receiving sheets and one kind of comparative image receiving sheet were produced as samples for use in the experiments. </paragraph>

This was because the ridges was deformed and the toner existing in the concavities was adhered to the paper due to the lack of reinforcing portion when the sheet was strongly rubbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> In the evaluation of cleanability, only the image receiving sheet of Experimental Example 5 required two cleaning operations to completely efface the images.

The ridges and the ascending reinforcing portions in the sheet of Experimental Example 5 were brought into orthogonal contact with the bottom portions of the concavities. Further, the bottom portions of concavities lacked a concavely curved surface in which case the toner was difficult to scrape off. </paragraph>
