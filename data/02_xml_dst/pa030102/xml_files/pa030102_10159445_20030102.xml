<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to a product stocking device, and more particularly, to a product stocking device for placing a plurality of packaged products on a display device in a substantially single step. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is well known to package products in a variety of display packages, such as display bags, blister packs, display cards, display containers, display tubes, or the like. The display packages usually include an aperture adjacent the top of each package, such that the display packages may hang from display hangers or peg hooks that extend from a display or display shelf. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally to display the display packages, a stocker retrieves each display bag, blister pack, display card, display container, or the like from a box or larger bag containing a multiplicity of display packages and mounts each display package individually onto a display hanger. Alternatively, a stocker takes a plurality of display packages from the box or larger bag and aligns the mounting apertures by hand and in turn mounts the plurality of display packages onto a display hanger. For the stocker, the process of mounting the display package onto the display hangers is a tedious and time consuming task that requires exceedingly repetitive work. Having such repetitive work for a stocker increases costs for the store employing the stocker and also increases the chances that the individual display packages could be dropped by the stocker, possibly causing damage to the product or the packaging itself, and that the display package could be torn or damaged because of the careless package handling brought on by the tedium of the stocking task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art to insert a common twist tie through the apertures of a plurality of display bags. The twist tie substantially causes coaxial alignment of the display bag apertures. The twist tie partially solves the problem of requiring a stocker to stock individual display bags one at a time. A twist tie however has the disadvantage of being difficult to manually disengage from the plurality of bags without the use of a suitable tool. Further, a twist tie requires a substantial twisting effort in putting together the plurality of bags. Further still, a twist tie does not have an area providing for easy labeling of the products that are held by the twist tie or for easy grasping by a stocker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need and desire for a device that improves the efficiency of handling a multiplicity of display packages to be mounted onto display hangers. There is also a need and desire for an efficient method of mounting a plurality of display packages onto display hangers. Further, there is a need and desire for a device which keeps a plurality of display packages together so that the plurality of display packages can be easily mounted onto display hangers in a substantially single step. Further still, there is a need and desire for a device that holds together a plurality of display packages that can be easily manufactured with little expense and can be easily packaged along with the plurality of display packages in a case or box, e.g. shipping container, containing a plurality of display packages. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While the method and device described herein are susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions, certain illustrative embodiments thereof has been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A display package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (shown as a card-type packaging) may contain a product, including, but not limited to, hardware items, school or office supplies, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each display package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include an aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent its top for mounting onto a display device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (shown as an elongate peg hook, which extends from an upright display, wall, display case, or the like). Display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are exemplary of the type of display packages that can be utilized with a stocking device; however, any of a variety of rigid or flexible display packages having at least one aperture for hanging on a hanger, rod, hook, or post, may be used. The products may also be sold without separate packaging, because the products themselves may include an aperture for mounting the product on the display device. As such, a stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would be configured to engage the aperture, or comparable feature, on the products themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and with specific reference initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the product stocking device is generally indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> coupled to a loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to provide an inexpensive and efficient device for handling (e.g., packaging, aligning, organizing, storing, shipping, and stocking) a plurality of packages. Display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are configured to be added onto the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and secured on the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to retain or &ldquo;capture&rdquo; the product packaging by a non-stretching type of engagement. After display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been loaded onto storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is orientated (twisted and bent) to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; the packaging to prevent the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from sliding off the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> until the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is again orientated to allow unloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a pair of opposing fins or flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending from shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are configured to engage with aligned apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a plurality of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. According to alternative embodiments, storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may have any of a variety of shapes and configurations designed to engage one or more types of packaging apertures. In this example, the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is sized and shaped to engage apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e., storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a three-sided or so called euro-style cross section that is slightly smaller than apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> cooperate with edges of aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to help keep the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> properly aligned and oriented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, further includes an abutment or stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, located at one end of storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (opposite the loading portion), and is configured to prevent display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from sliding off storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The size and/or shape of stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is dimensioned (e.g., a diameter) so that it is larger than a corresponding dimension of aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of display package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In another example, the stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an area of sufficient size for labeling or other indicia (e.g., product identification, shipping origin, shipping destination, seller information, UPC Code data, buyer/customer information, etc.) A ring or grasping member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, may be located at an end of storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and may be configured to provide a stocker with a member to easily manipulate the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or retain display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or to provide a coupling member for a packaging machine or fixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Located on the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a coupling portion or notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be a variety of shapes and sizes. In one example, the notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may have a general &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape, including a retaining portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The retaining portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be directed towards the stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the loading shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is biased into the retaining portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> when engaged with the notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, retaining portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be directed away from stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. More specifically, notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may have a width that narrows so that shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is frictionally gripped by flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such that when shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is engaged with notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are retained between stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In other examples, the coupling portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may a clip or other retaining device adapted to hold and/or retain the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The coupling portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also need not be located on the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but may be located next to or near the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, the coupling portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be a knob or a single slit located on the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, respectively. Similarly, there may be more than one coupling portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> located on the product storage device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, the coupling portion could be located on the stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to receive an elongate loading shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include a flexible shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a tip or head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The flexible shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be fixedly attached to the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or may be detachable. The shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is adapted to engage with the notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to prevent display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from being pulled off the storing portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (e.g., the contortion of shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and location of head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). The head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and/or storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may have any of a variety of shapes and sizes which generally correspond with the shape and size of the aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (e.g., triangular, rectangular, circular, ovular, clover-leaf, etc.). In another example, the shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be rigid and may be adapted to detach from the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. While detached, the shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will be able to engage with the coupling portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to retain the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> configured to receive a display device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as a peg hook. According to an alternative embodiment, socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may have a variety of shapes and sizes, which are configured to receive peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In one example, the head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include an outer dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (e.g., outer diameter D1) that is less than a correspondingly-shaped dimension of aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the inner dimension <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (e.g., inner diameter D2) of the head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or the diameter of the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, may be larger than the outer diameter or corresponding dimension of the peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be configured (e.g., sized and shaped) to be flexible and allow movement of the head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> relative to the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be flexibly configured to engage notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> once loaded are secured on the storage portion (i.e. between the stop member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be formed as a single piece during a single injection molding operation, or the components of the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be separately molded and later assembled together (e.g., with adhesive, thermal bonding, fasteners, snap fit engagements, or the like). More specifically, the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed from an injection molding process using polypropylene, but even other materials can be used, including other thermoplastic resins such as high density polyethylene, other polyethylenes, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (&ldquo;ABS&rdquo;), polyurethane, Nylon, any of a variety of homopolymer plastics, copolymer plastics, plastics with special additives, filled plastics, etc. Also, other molding operations may be used to form these components, such as blow molding, rotational molding, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Similarly, while the components of the disclosed product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been and will be illustrated as being used with a three-sided aperture (&ldquo;eurostyle&rdquo; mounting hole) designed for cardboard panels (&ldquo;display cards&rdquo;), the features of product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a much wider applicability. For example, the product stocking device&apos;s design may be adaptable for other packaging containers for any of a variety of office, home, educational, repair and other products that are configured to be mounted to a display. Further, the size of the various components and the size of the apertures, packaging materials, etc. may be widely varied. For example, the display devices may include display hangers, hooks, other elongate rods, or elements that extend from a generally vertical surface of a display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In operation, the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used to hold one or more display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are uniformly aligned and organized for storage, shipment, stocking, etc. The display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are created at a packaging or manufacturing facility where the product/products are sealed in display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are then loaded onto a stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by sliding one or more display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and loading shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, of the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and then onto the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. (Product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be sized to accommodate any number of packages, as desired.) After display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are loaded onto storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is twisted or oriented so that shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> engages notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and is then locked into place in the retaining portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> After a desired quantity of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been loaded onto stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are retained, the product storage device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be removed from a packaging machine and placed in a box or container for storage or shipment. Product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also be held by a worker and the products or the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be manually placed onto product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or may be mounted to a fixture and/or mounted to an automated product loading apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In one example, a retainer band <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such as a rubber band, an elastic band, a flexible band, a non-flexible band or other retaining device, may be wrapped around the plurality of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to hold the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> substantially in line with one another and to prevent the shifting or tangling of products during shipping. After a plurality of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been retained by product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for instance, the plurality of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be bound by the elastic or rubber band <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> around the mid-section of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to keep them more firmly and compactly together during delivery of the products. Also, band <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may prevent each group of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from substantially interfering with other groups of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a case, a carton, or a box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to be sent to a customer. After display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been bound by rubber bands <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, they may be inserted into a case or box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to be stored or sent to the customer. A plurality of these bound sets of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, each being retained by product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may be inserted into a single case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In another example, however, the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> need not be bound together by retainer bands <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, because the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may hold the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> substantially in line with one another and prevent the shifting or tangling of products by engaging the apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example, may be of any shape, including the &ldquo;euro-style&rdquo; hole having a round hole with elongate sides, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, and the storing portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, may have a shape complimentary to the aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may compliment the round part of the aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may each compliment one of the elongate sides of the aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With both the storing portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having complimentary profiles, the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be kept in line with one another and may prevented from shifting or from becoming entangled with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is received at a store (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), or any other place where the products are going to be displayed, each retained set of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be lifted from the box or case <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by grasping the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and lifting the set of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is unloaded by disengaging shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from notch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, of the loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, may then be engaged with the display device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by engaging socket <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the end of the peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, because the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was inserted through apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (and the display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) will be aligned substantially coaxially. Thus, they may be transferred directly onto peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by pushing display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from their initial position on the storage portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, over loading portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and onto peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user has avoided having to individually mount each separate one of the plurality of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto the peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Once the plurality of display packages <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been transferred as a group to peg hook <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is removed and then disposed of, reused, or recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that the construction and arrangement of the elements of the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the method as shown herein are only illustrative. Although only a few examples of the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been described in detail in this disclosure, those skilled in the art who review this disclosure will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible (e.g., variations in sizes, dimensions, structures, shapes and proportions of the various elements, values of parameters, mounting arrangements, use of materials, colors, orientations, etc.) without materially departing from the present invention.

Similarly, the operation of the interfaces may be reversed or otherwise varied, the length or width of the structures and/or members or connector or other elements of the system may be varied, and/or the nature or number of adjustment positions provided between the elements may be varied (e.g. by variations in the number of engagement slots or size of the engagement slots or type of engagement). Also, the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have any number of a variety of designs and configurations to work with a variety of display arrangements. Further, the product stocking device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> could also be made without flexible shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (e.g., the loading portion only including the head, the loading portion being detachable in order to engage the storage portion, etc.) It should be noted that the elements and/or assemblies of the system may be constructed from any of a wide variety of materials that provide sufficient strength or durability, in any of a wide variety of colors, textures and combinations. It should also be noted that the display system may be used in association with a rotating display, or alternatively other, fixed and non-movable displays or any of a wide variety of other surfaces in any of a wide variety of other applications. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present inventions. Other substitutions, modifications, changes and omissions may be made in the design, operating conditions and arrangement of the preferred and other exemplary embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
