<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, a first embodiment of a movable panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a furniture screening panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted on a wheeled base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that extends around the periphery of the panel. Frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be formed of conventional construction materials, such as 1&frac78; inches timber, tubular steel frame, formed steel, or plastic or composite material. The frame includes side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a bottom rail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a top rail <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Top rail <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a U-shaped portion creating a recess <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for a wireless receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The panel includes spaced cross beams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> defining a partially or completely open center section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, an upper section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> filled with door core material, and a lower section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also filled with door core material. Lower beam <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes fastener connections <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for connecting arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The center section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the screening panel may have an open interior or it may be partially filled with door core or other sound deadening or strengthening materials and provided with recesses for the various components of the invention. The outer edges of the screening panel desirably are covered with 1&frac78; inches PVC bumper molding or other appropriate material in order to prevent damage to other furniture that the panel may come in contact with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The face of the panel can be covered with a number of different types of surface material. For example, the panel can be covered with fiberboard (which can be fabric covered), a marker board or a tackboard. Or the panel can be covered with a laminate. A number of other surface treatments can be employed. In one embodiment of the present invention, upper and lower sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are covered with a normal decorative covering. Center section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is covered with an insert capable of accepting a tackboard, markerboard, liquid crystal monitor, speakers, or NXT transducer system. The insert, also called a face plate, also accepts various plug-in modules, including level 3 and level 5 MJ 85 jacks <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to provide quick disconnect for computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, monitor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can fit in a monitor opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and speakers or transducers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fit in openings <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Transducers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> desirably are NXT transducers. NXT transducers, in effect, supplant regular loudspeakers and convert the entire screening panel assembly into a speaker. This technology has the advantage of causing sound transmission from the surfaces of the panel on both sides of the panel. As an alternative, loudspeakers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be employed in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Appropriate wiring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> interconnects these components with receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A rechargeable battery pack <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected by wiring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the receiver. The receiver can be operated by the rechargeable battery pack or it can be plugged into a conventional 110 outlet by plug-in wire assembly. Alternatively, the battery pack can be connected to a battery charger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The battery pack <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> provides eight hours of operation and is rechargeable by means of a low voltage recharger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which plugs into a conventional 110 volt outlet. The battery pack is easily removed for replacement or servicing. In the illustrated embodiment, the battery pack is mounted in the upper corner of the panel. The battery pack consists of several batteries connected together to achieve a nominal 9.5 volt power source. The battery pack sends power to the receiver and amplifier. A low voltage 9.5 volt recharger is included with the battery pack and desirably plugs into a jack <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> located in the lower corner of the panel. The charger provides quick recharge to the batteries through cable <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and is easily unplugged from the panel as well as the wall. The 110 volt plug <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> has a unique stowaway compartment <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> that accepts both the cord and the plug. This allows the user to determine whether they desire to use only batteries, charge the batteries, or operate the unit on a standard 110 volt duplex receptacle. The battery pack is made of polyvinyl plastic and is encased in an extruded plastic channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The battery pack is designed to operate for a period of 8 hours before a recharge is required. The battery pack removes simply without tools for ease of maintenance and/or replacement. Various combinations of battery voltages may be utilized to achieve differing results. The 9.5 volts are utilized for peak performance, easy storage, and low voltage drain. Cases could be used out of metal and/or plastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The wheel assembly or base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of spaced arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that extend laterally from both sides of the panel at opposite ends of the panel. The arms are formed of solid steel bar stock and are painted or plated and final coated with an expanded polyvinyl foam. Rubber or a soft durometer plastic or other cushioning material also can be used. The polyvinyl, which should cover at least the ends or tips of the legs, prevents the unit from tipping and from damaging furniture or walls that they may come in contact with. The arms of the wheel assembly preferably are manufactured from cold-rolled steel, desirably {fraction (3/4)} inches in thickness, and are formed with a slight upward arc in the center to prevent accidental engagement with a hazard. Threaded inserts at the ends of the arms provide a mounting surface to affix the wheels. The heavy steel functions as a counter weight to help deter tipping of the panel. The lateral extension of the arms further impedes panel tipping. Caster wheels <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are positioned at the outer ends of each leg. These casters are conventional. Preferably two standard casters and two locking casters are employed. The locking casters permit the panel to be fixed at a desired position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Instead of manufacturing the wheel assembly out of solid steel bar stock, the wheel assembly can be manufactured from other suitable materials, such as formed steel of various thicknesses, with a counterweight separately placed in the panel. Also, the wheels could be welded instead of being affixed by threaded inserts. Various finishes can be utilized, such as chrome plating, E-coat plating, wet coat finishing, and various molded caps and covers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is made out of various battery-powered components that offer the least amount of voltage drain. A built in amplifier is integrated to boost signal volume. A light emitting diode <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> indicates the unit&apos;s operation status. The receiver slides out for easy repair and battery replacement. The receiver is a device that receives various signals including: voice, data, stereo quality music, mono quality music, and streaming video. The receiver includes an integrated amplifier that is powered either by battery and/or standard 110 volt electricity. The receiver includes a light emitting diode to locate the off/on position of the unit. A plunger style off/on device is also located within the receiver. A removable cover assist with the easy removal of the receiver to replace the battery and for repair and/or maintenance. The receiver is adapted to receive either a wireless of infrared signal. The receiver allows various degrees of adjustment to allow different channels to be fine tuned with the transmitter. The receiver can be constructed of molded PVC plastic or other suitable material. Multiple dipswitches allow the user to select different signals including voice, data, streaming video, stereo music, white noise, and intercom. The dipswitches are activated to pick up which channel the supervisor is transmitting. The receiver can also incorporate a transmitter in order to transmit voice, data, and intercom back to the transmitter. The secondary receiver operation allows the supervisor/conference attendee to communicate via a wireless connection. The receiver may utilize differing signal transfer rates and means of device selection including: infrared, wireless 900 megahertz, 32 megahertz, and other new technologies that allow for the transfer of data and voice components over the air ways. The receiver may be constructed of various plastics and/or metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, signals are transmitted to the receiver from a control box <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, located remotely from the receiver. The control box receives input from various communication sources, including a sound masking white noise generator. The control box is connected to wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> through cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Multiple dipswitches in the control box allow for selection of the desired signals to be transmitted through the transmitter. For example, the unit will transmit compact disc quality music, white noise, streaming video, and intercom pick-ups and transmitters. These devices will allow a conference to broadcast to another room, another device, and to interact with each other. This offers a non-attendee of a conference to attend while being up to 150 feet away. The signals travel through walls and obstructions and allow clear communications. Furthermore, the dipswitch device will allow for multiple broadcast of different signals to singular or multiple receivers. The dipswitch device of control box <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> consists of several off and on switches, RCA input jacks and/or screws, clips or differing combinations in order to integrate differing devices. The switches allow the supervisor to choose what signal they wish to broadcast including: voice, data, streaming video, stereo music, white noise, and intercom. The multiple dipswitch device allows for hook up of an infrared repeater unit to allow selections to be made from a distance through an optional remote control. The control box dipswitch device may incorporate other methods for device selection including FM wireless remote controls. It may also be hooked up directly to the main transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The main transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> allows units to be operated off of one transmitter. The transmitter has a separate volume control to allow supervisor maximum volume control settings while still allowing users final adjustment. The unit may be locked in various cabinets, as the size does not exceed 8&Prime;&times;7&Prime;. The main transmitter also can include a secondary receiver unit. The main purpose of the transmitter unit is to transmit signals including: voice, data, white noise, stereo music, and intercom, while its secondary purpose is to receive voice and data back to the unit. The main transmitter secondary receiver has supervisor volume controls, an antenna, a 110 volt wall plug, and a battery to operate if needed without 110 voltage. The unit is easily secured in a supervisor&apos;s overhead compartment or drawer unit to prevent unauthorized transmitting of signals, and/or volume controls without approval. The secondary receiver operation allows the supervisor/conference attendee to communicate back and forth via a wireless connection. The transmitter can be manufactured from various plastics and/or metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The panel is attached to the wheel assembly that provides easy mobility. The main transmitter is connected only by airwaves to the receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The receiver likewise is connected back to the main transmitter through the airwaves. The main amplifier is attached to the receiver as well as the main battery pack, light emitting diode, and to the speakers and/or transducers. The speakers and/or transducers are attached to the faceplate of the insert covering center section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which desirably is a stiff fiberboard-like material. The faceplate in turn is attached to the panel. The wireless connection removes any restrictions on the placement or movement of the screening panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In operation, the supervisor activates the main transmitter. This produces a signal of voice, data, stereo music, white noise, or streaming video as selected by the supervisor. The user turns the main receiver to the on position until the light emitting diode is activated. The signal travels to the panel that has the main receiver located in it. The receiver receives the signal. The amplifier of the receiver is adjusted by the user through the use of the volume control. The amplifier, now adjusted to the desired volume strength, carries the signal by wires to the transducers and/or speakers that in turn allow the signal to be heard. The same is the case with data or video, only it is transmitted to the liquid crystal display. The receiver can be mounted by different attachment mechanisms to a number of things other than space divider panels, including doors, artwork, hanging units, and suspended units. The receiver and speakers are attached to the panel as a means to offer visual and/or divided space in addition to at the point audio or video communication. The wheel assembly provides mobility for the panel and the electronic equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> There are several uses for this invention. One is for a conference. The user simply wheels the panel into the area he desires. The supervisor then transmits a signal for the conference. The supervisor can attend the meeting without leaving his desk while the conference receives data, picks up the data, and provides a visual display. The supervisor can talk and/or hear the presentation and interact accordingly. Another example would be for a user who is working at a desk without walls or privacy and needs some either temporary or full time visual and noise screening. They would wheel the device to the desired location. The panel would provide the visual relief while the receiver would produce white noise sound masking. The white noise would be at the point of need and would allow for relief from others hearing the user&apos;s conversations. Another example would be a large conference center. The panels would be wheeled into place and generate audio output where needed. Secondary transmitters in the panels would permit audience feedback or participation or questions to a speaker without the need for separate microphones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, panel <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a door having a frame <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a surface panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on both sides of the door.

The artwork can be moved to any other location as may be desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The sound transmission system of the present invention, wherein a single transmitter connected to multiple sources of input signals, including sound masking signals, are transmitted to individual receivers at the points of use by a wireless transmission system can be employed in a number of different ways, in addition to the movable panels as described above. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> receiver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is shown in schematic form mounted in a keyboard tray <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> on the underside of a work surface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Speakers or transducers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> can be mounted on any rigid or semi-rigid surface, such as the keyboard tray itself, or on the work surface, so that a wireless signal directed to the receiver will be received in the computer keyboard tray of an operator&apos;s work station. The advantage of all of these systems is that the receivers can be placed where desired and moved to new locations without requiring modification of wiring, and in each case, both the supervisor and individual operator have control over the signal received at the operator&apos;s work location. Moreover, sound masking as well as other communication signals and background music and the like can be transmitted through the same system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that various modification and changes may be made in the arrangements and details of construction of the embodiments disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and cope of the present invention, as defined in the attached claims. </paragraph>
