<heading lvl="1">Field of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention lies in the semiconductor technology field. More specifically, the invention relates to a semiconductor chip, a memory module and a method for testing the semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure the correct functioning of semiconductor chips, semiconductor chips are usually tested prior to delivery. In principle, there are two different procedures for this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> By way of example, it is possible to connect an external test device to the semiconductor chips and to check the semiconductor chips with the aid of this test device. A disadvantage here is that the semiconductor chips each have to be individually contact-connected, which is complicated given the large number of semiconductor chips on a wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to integrate the test circuit into the semiconductor chip and to drive it externally via an interface. This method is known under the designation BIST (&ldquo;Build In Self Test&rdquo;) in the semiconductor industry. In some cases, the test circuit also provides for a self-repair of the semiconductor chips. This method is also known as BISR (&ldquo;Build In Self Repair&rdquo;). One disadvantage of the integrated test circuits is that they take up a considerable proportion of the area of the semiconductor chip. This leads to an unacceptable increase in the costs for fabricating the semiconductor chips. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a semiconductor chip, a memory module and a method for testing the semiconductor chip, which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and which provides for a semiconductor chip and, in particular, a memory module which can be tested in a simple manner.

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again an added feature of the invention, the control chip is formed with a given minimum feature size that is larger than a minimum feature size of the memory chip stacked on the control chip. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With the above and other objects in view there is also provided, in accordance with the invention, a method of testing semiconductor chips, which comprises stacking the semiconductor chips on a control chip configured for testing a function of the semiconductor chips and forming contact between the control chip and the semiconductor chips with a contact looped through from one side of the semiconductor chips to another side of the semiconductor chips; and testing the function of the semiconductor chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again another feature of the invention, a wafer composite of a multiplicity of semiconductor chips arranged next to one another is stacked on top of a wafer composite of control chips arranged next to one another. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The sole FIGURE of the drawing shows a perspective view of a plurality of memory chips stacked on control chips.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the FIGURE of the drawing in detail, a series of control chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed next to one another to form a bottommost layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The drawing is intended to indicate that the control chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are still situated in the wafer composite. Disposed above the control chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are a second layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a third layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a fourth layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which are likewise still situated in the wafer composite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to test the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the respectively assigned control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits test signals to the overlying memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In order that the test signals reach the memory chips in the layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, contacts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on an underside <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are in each case looped through to contact points <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on a top side <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the respective memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Methods for fabricating such looped-through contacts are known to the person skilled in the art and are not the subject matter of the application. This means that signal lines running on the top side of the semiconductor chip are led through a hole running through the semiconductor body and are led to the other, opposite side of the semiconductor chip. Contact areas <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged on the top side of one of the chips are connected via the looped-through contacts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the contact areas <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged on the underside of the chip. The contacts are each externally accessible from the surface and can be contact-connected for feeding in and tapping off signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The contacts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> looped through to the contact points <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of each memory chip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected to the internal data, address and command lines in the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can address memory cells in the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the customary data, address, and command lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is also possible that only a selection among the data, address and command lines is required for carrying out the test method. In this case, it suffices to loop through the required selection on data, address, and command lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The configuration illustrated in the FIGURE is distinguished by the separation of memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the test circuit integrated into the control chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, no chip area is lost in the expensive memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be processed with a technology from a preceding technology generation and have a larger minimum feature size than that minimum feature size of the memory chips. The smallest feature size is, for example, the length of the gate of a MOS field-effect transistor. In general, the circuitry outlay for the control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is significantly smaller than that for the memory chip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be tested. Therefore, despite the larger feature size, the occupied chip area of the control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be smaller than the occupied chip area in the memory chip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This is also advantageous insofar as the processes of the preceding technology generation have reached a significantly higher degree of maturity and are therefore less susceptible to faults than the present technology generation used. It can therefore be assumed that the control chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be produced virtually without any defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the configuration illustrated in the FIGURE, the components required for performing BIST (Build in Self Test) and BISR (Build in Self Repair) are no longer situated in each of the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, but are shifted to the lowermost layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the chip stack into the control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, a division of work takes place between the lowermost layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The control signals that initiate and control a test method according to BIST or BISR are generated by the control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The control signals are transferred from the control chip to the semiconductor chips of the chip stack that are arranged above said control chip, in order to test said semiconductor chips for correct functioning and, if appropriate, to repair them. By way of example, test results are transferred from the semiconductor chips to the control chips, where decisions about functionality and repair steps are determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment described here is suitable in particular for identical semiconductor chips such as the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrated in the FIGURE. However, it is also conceivable for a series of semiconductor chips with identical external dimensions to be stacked on top of one another, which are each connected via a contact looped through from an underside to a top side. The communication with the individual memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can take place through these separate command lines. The data communication on the command lines preferably takes place in a serial manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it shall be noted that the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrated in the FIGURE can each be combined to form a memory module and be arranged in a housing. The memory modules with a control chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on which the memory chips <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are stacked have a significantly larger storage capacity compared with conventional memory modules each having a memory chip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> inside the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the memory modules produced in this way can also be used to produce memory modules having a high storage capacity that can be used in a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Wafers containing a multiplicity of chips can also be stacked one above the other and be connected to one another in this way. The wafers of the upper layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> contain semiconductor memory modules which are still contained in the wafer composite. The wafer of the bottom layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> contains the control chips for initiating and performing the test of the respective overlying memory module in the overlying wafer. The wafers of the planes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are in each case embodied identically through the looped-through contacts and can equally be used in one of the planes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
