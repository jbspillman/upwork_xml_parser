<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to a vehicle seat and more particularly, relates to a vehicle seat intended for use in a motor vehicle such as a motor car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It has been appreciated that if a motor vehicle, such as a motor car, is involved in a rear-end collision or rear impact&mdash;that is to say if a following vehicle runs into the back of the car&mdash;the occupants of the struck car often suffer from neck injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that during a rear-end collision of this type, the vehicle that is struck is subjected to a forward acceleration. This imparts a forward acceleration to the seats of the vehicle. The squab and the back of each occupied seat engage the posterior and torso of the occupant of the seat and impart a substantial acceleration to the posterior and torso of the occupant. However, no corresponding acceleration is immediately imparted to the head of the occupant. The head is a part of the body that has substantial mass, and consequently the head has substantial inertia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thus, whilst the posterior and torso of the occupant of the vehicle are accelerated forwardly as a result of the rear-end collision, the head of the occupant of the vehicle initially remains stationary. This causes the neck initially to adopt a &ldquo;S&rdquo;-shaped configuration as the lower part of the neck moves forwardly, whilst &ldquo;S&rdquo;-shaped configuration as the lower part of the neck moves forwardly, whilst remaining vertical, and the upper part of the neck remains in its initial position. Subsequently, the head begins to rotate, and the neck then occupies a curved configuration. The head subsequently moves forwardly. Research has shown that &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; injuries may occur when the neck adopts the &ldquo;S&rdquo;-shaped configuration, if the head is moving, relative to the torso, at a substantial speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to provide an improved vehicle seat in which the risk of &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; injuries occurring to the occupant of the seat during a rear-end collision are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to this invention there is provided a vehicle seat, the seat comprising a squab and a back the back being mounted for pivotal movement relative to the squab of the seat incorporating energy absorbing force limiting means adapted to absorb energy as the back of the seat moves rearwardly when subjected to a force from the torso of an occupant of the seat, if a vehicle in which the seat is mounted is involved in a rear impact, the energy absorbing force limiting means providing a first resistive force resisting the pivotal movement during a first predetermined pivotal movement, and second resistive force during a second subsequent pivotal movement, the resistive force provided during the first pivotal movement being dependent upon the energy of the rear impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferably the energy absorbing force limiting mean comprise elements to provide the first resistive force comprising an energy absorbing force limiting device and a damped spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Conveniently the energy absorbing force limiting device and the damped spring are connected in series between the back of the seat and an element mounted on the squab of the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Advantageously the damped spring comprises a spring connected in parallel with a fluid-filled cylinder containing a double acting piston, the opposed ends of the cylinder being inter-connected by a parallel connection of a non-return valve and a constriction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably the energy absorbing force limiting means comprise a framework present within the back of the set adapted to deform when subjected to a predetermined force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Advantageously the energy absorbing force limiting means comprise an energy absorbing force limiting device adapted to provide said second resistive force during the second subsequent pivotal movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Conveniently the back of the seat is mounted for pivotal movement between predetermined limits relative to a support the support being pivotally mounted to the squab of the seat, the said energy absorbing force limiting device providing the second resistive force during the second subsequent pivotal movement being adapted to provide the resistive support on pivotal movement of said support.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order that the invention may be more readily understood, and so that further features thereof may be appreciated, the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view comprising four illusions showing the condition of head and neck of an occupant of a vehicle in rear collision situation where a conventional seat is used, </paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings, illustration A shows the position of the head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and neck <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the occupant of a motor vehicle during ordinary conditions. The head and neck would occupy this position if, for example, the vehicle were stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the vehicle was then subjected to a rear impact the posterior and torso of the occupant of the vehicle would be moved forwardly, as a consequence of the forward movement of the vehicle and the forward movement of the seat mounted in the vehicle. The head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the occupant would tend to remain stationary. A neck <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the occupant would then have the condition shown in illustration B. The neck here has a &ldquo;S&rdquo; configuration. Subsequently, as shown in illustration C, the head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves rearwardly, thus giving the neck <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> an arcuate configuration and, if the head does not impinge on the head-rest, the head can move to the tilted back position shown in illustration D where the neck <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is bent back (Hyperextension) with a very significant degree of curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is believed that if the neck is subject to the distortions shown in illustrations A to D, the hydro-dynamic pressure of the fluid within the spine can rise suddenly, when the neck adopts the &ldquo;S&rdquo;-shaped configuration, thus imparting pressure shocks to parts of the central nervous system in contact with that fluid. Also, injuries may well be imparted to the ganglia. It is believed that this is why patients with so-called &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; injuries may suffer from the effects of those injuries for a long time. Even though a typical rear impact collision occurs with a relatively low impact speed, these collisions are responsible for a large number of relatively serious injuries each year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Whilst it has been proposed previously to provide a seat having a seat back which moves rearwardly, against a retarding force, in the event that a rear impact should occur, such prior proposals have not differentiated between a low speed or low intensity rear impact, and a high speed or high intensity rear impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings, a seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for use in a vehicle such as a motor car is illustrated. The seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a squab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adapted to be secured to the floor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the motor vehicle. The squab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be secured to the floor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of a carriage slideable along rails mounted in the floor. The seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> carrying a head-rest <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> incorporates a frame, one are <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of which is visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected by means of a pivot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to a support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is secured to the squab of the seat. The frame member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can pivot about the pivot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between a forward-most position as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in which the frame element contacts a stop <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and a rear-most position when the frame element contacts a stop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A force limiter assembly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which will be described hereinafter in greater detail, is connected between the frame element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is actually connected to the squab of the seat by means of a pivotal connection <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can thus effect a pivotal motion about the axis defined by the pivotal connection <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is associated with an energy absorbing force limiting device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> connected between the support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the squab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the seat. Thus, if the combination of the seat back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> pivot about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the energy absorbing force limiting device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> resists the movement absorbing energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the force limiter assembly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is illustrated in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The force limiter assembly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected, by appropriate connection means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and is also connected, by appropriate connection means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the frame member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> forming part of the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the seat The force limiter assembly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a series connection of an energy absorbing force limiting device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a damped spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The damped spring comprises the combination of a spring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected in parallel with a fluid-filled cylinder <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> containing a double acting piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the opposed ends of the cylinder being connected by the parallel connection of a non-return valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a constriction <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If a seat as illustrated, and described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> is in a vehicle which is subjected to a low speed or low energy rear impact, the squab of the seat will be accelerated forwardly whilst the torso of an occupant of the seat will tend to remain stationary due to inertia. The back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the seat will thus be brought into contact with the torso of the occupant of the seat, and will start to accelerate the torso of the occupant of the seat. Effectively, the torso of the occupant of the seat will apply a rearwardly directed force to the back of the seat causing, initially, the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the seat to pivot about the pivot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The back of the seat thus executes a first pivotal movement. Because the force is a relatively low force, the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moved to the right within cylinder <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, against a resisting bias provided by spring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> causing fluid present within the cylinder to flow through the constriction <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The resisting force is thus a relatively low substantially constant resistive force as the back of the seat moves rearwardly, as illustrated by the solid line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is a graphical figure showing resistive force plotted against the distance of pivotal movement of the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the seat. The resistivity force is a combination of the force provided by the spring and the effect of fluid flowing through the constriction <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the frame member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has pivoted about the pivot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to such an extent that the frame member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> engages the stop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, (shown as point S on the axis of the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) if the force applied to the back of the seat is sufficient, the back of the seat executes a second pivot movement during which the support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> pivots about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and energy is absorbed by energy absorbing force limiting device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in the solid line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that following the impact, the spring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will contract, thus moving the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> towards the left within the cylinder <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The fluid within the cylinder may easily flow through the non-return valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to facilitate this movement of the piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thus, if the vehicle is involved in a mild rear impact, only the spring loaded damper unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will operate, and, if the impact is great enough, the energy absorbing force limiting device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will also operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If, in contrast, the vehicle is involved in a high speed, high energy rear impact, a very substantial acceleration will be imparted to the squab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the seat, and to the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the seat. The torso of the occupant, because of its inertia, will impart a substantial force against the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the seat The force will tend to move the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> very rapidly towards the right within the cylinder as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This will tend to cause fluid to flow very swiftly through the constriction <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The constriction <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will prevent the flow of fluid and consequently the spring biased damped unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will become substantially rigid. The energy absorbing force limiter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will consequently extend, absorbing a substantial amount of energy, and thus providing a very substantial force limiting effect as the frame element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the seat back moves pivotally about the pivot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to engage the stop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the stop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been engaged, the support plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will pivot about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. During this pivoting movement energy will be absorbed by the energy absorbing force limiter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The resisting force will thus be high during the first pivotal movement as the frame member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> moves from stop <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to stop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, because the energy absorbing force limiter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operating. This is shown as the dashed line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Should the vehicle be involved in an intermediate energy and intermediate speed rear impact, the force limiter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> assembly may operate so that during the movement of the frame element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between the stop <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the stop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, part of the energy is absorbed by the force limiter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and pare of the energy is absorbed by the gas spring unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This is shown by the dotted line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that, in a vehicle seat as described above, the reaction of the seat to a rear impact depends upon the energy of the rear impact. In a low energy rear impact the torso of the occupant is effectively accelerated very gradually by the back of the seat, thus minimising the risk of injury to the torso. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> However, in a high energy or high speed rear impact, it is not practicable to accelerate the torso of the occupant with only a relatively low acceleration, by permitting the back of the seat to move rearwardly in an appropriate manner, since there would be a grave risk that the back of the seat would be substantially horizontal before the occupant of the seat had been given a sufficient acceleration. This would be clearly disadvantageous since if the back of the seat did approach the horizontal condition, the occupant of the seat would tend to slide rearwardly out of the seat due to inertia, with a very grave risk of severe injuries occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the seat of the present invention, if the vehicle in which the seat is mounted is subjected to a high energy rear impact, the seat responds by giving the torso of the occupant a relatively high acceleration whilst still minimising that acceleration as much as practicable. In an intermediate situation, the seat provides an intermediate response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that in the described embodiments of the invention the back of the seat effects the two movements, the first movement being a pivotal movement about the pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the second movement being a pivotal movement about the pivotal connection <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with both movements being against appropriate force limiting means. It is to be understood that the second movement could, instead of being moved about a pivot such as the pivotal connection <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, comprise a deformation of the frame forming the back of the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is also to be understood that whilst in the described embodiment there are two pivotal movements about two pivot axes, the two pivotal movements could be about a single pivot axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, energy absorbing force limiters have been illustrated in a totally schematic way. Different types of energy absorbing force limiters could be utilised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates one type of force limiter that can be used, comprising a cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed of an appropriate material which defines an outlet orifice <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. A piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is present within the cylinder. The space between the piston and the outlet orifice <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is filled with a deformable material. The deformable material may comprise lead or a plastic material. The cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is fixed in position and the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the movable element. Thus, for example, the cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be connected to the outer frame, with the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> being connected to the inner frame. Alternatively, the cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be connected to the side piece <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> being connected to the side element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the main frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The arrangement is such that as the movable element moves, this piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is driven into the cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thus ejecting the material <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> that is initially inside the cylinder through the outlet orifice <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. This provides a force limiting effect </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An alternative form of force limiter is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A plate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is provided which supports two upwardly extending posts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. A metal strip <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is located to substantially surround one post <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, then to pass through the gap between the post <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, subsequently lying adjacent another part of the strip <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. If the free end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the strip is pulled, the metal strip will slide through the posts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, with the metal strip being deformed. This will absorb energy. </paragraph>
