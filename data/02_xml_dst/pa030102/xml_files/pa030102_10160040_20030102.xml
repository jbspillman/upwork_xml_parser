<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a probe apparatus for being used in the Internet protocol based network management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, the Internet protocol (IP) based network like as a Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) backbone, is composed of a group of network devices such as a rooter, a hub, a bridge, a switch and the like. The IP based network comprises a management station for monitoring and managing a data communication status among the network devices. The management station remotely monitors the status of the IP based network and the behaviors of the network devices by periodically polling a group of the network devices or a communication network in the IP based network to be managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A simple network management protocol (SNMP) is widely used as an interface between the management station and the IP based network to be managed. The SNMP is a protocol which is developed to monitor and manage the IP based network system. In other words, the management station monitors and controls the IP based network and processes a traffic statistics collecting operation or the like by exchanging messages based on the SNMP, with the IP based network. Furthermore, the management station grasps a performance and a security status on the IP based network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The messages which are transmitted or received between the management station and the IP based network to be managed, are exchanged by using a series of numbers based on a common database. As a result, the massages become simple and clear. The common database is referred to as management information base (MIB) and is composed of an aggregate of objects having a hierarchical tree structure. Hereinafter, each of the objects is referred to as an MIB object. In detail, in the SNMP, each individual meaning of the MIB objects is designated in accordance with a hierarchy in which each of the MIB objects is stored and in accordance with a numeral number which is attached to each of the MIB objects, respectively. As a result, it is possible to deal with any combination of the network devices in the IP based network regardless of a kind of the network device and a structure of the IP based network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to grasp the present status of the IP based network, the management station always carries out the maintenance of the IP based network, such as, reads out the management information base and updates the management information base. In other words, the management station exchanges each of the MIB objects as an SNMP message with the IP based network when the IP based network is operated. In this event, an apparatus for generating the SNMP message on the IP based network, is each of the network devices which are composed of the IP based network, or is a specific one for collecting and processing traffic statistic values. The specific apparatus is referred to as a probe apparatus. Furthermore, when each of the network devices exchanges the SNMP message with the management station, each of the network devices carries out the exchange of the SNMP message through the IP based network to be managed or through a specific cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With respect to the representative network management system according to an earlier development, three examples thereof will be explained in the concrete. That is, the example (1) in which the network station exchanges the SNMP message with each of the network devices through the IP based network, the example (2) in which the network station exchanges the SNMP message with each of the network devices through the specific cable, and the example (3) in which the probe apparatus is used, will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a view for illustrating an example of the structure of the IP based network and three examples of the network management system. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprises network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> which are connected to one another through cables. The network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> are nodes in the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and are used as a passage point, a relay point, a branch point and a concourse point of an IP packet flowing in the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In the concrete, the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> correspond to the rooter, the hub, the switch and the like. The management stations X, Y, and Z are connected to the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The management station X manages the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and takes the management system based on the above-mentioned example (1). That is, the management station X is directly connected to the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to be managed and exchanges the SNMP message with each of the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by using a part of frequency band of the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> broken line denotes an SNMP link which is formed between the management station X and the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned example, each of the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> collect or store information such as an amount of data transfer (traffic statistic value) in each predetermined time period, which is processed by themselves, and detected error information and the like. The stored information is converted into a MIB format. On the other hand, the management station X polls the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to require them to supply the management station X with the information, such as the traffic statistic value and information relating to the existence of the detected error. When the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are required by the management station X, the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> transfers the required information to the management station X by using a function called an agent (by operation of software in general). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The management station Y manages a network device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and takes the management system based on the above-mentioned example (2). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the management station Y does not directly join in communications on the IP based network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and is connected to the network device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> through a management cable <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The network device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> generates the traffic statistic value and the information relating to the existence of the error at predetermined time intervals, in a similar manner described in the example (1). The network device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> converts the above-mentioned information into the MIB format to store it therein. Furthermore, the network device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> transmits the SNMP message to the management station Y in accordance with the requirement which is supplied from the management station Y. At that time, the SNMP message is transmitted and received between the network device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the management station Y through the management cable <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The management station Z manages a communication status of the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> by using a probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and takes the management system based on the above-mentioned example (3). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the management station Z is connected to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> through a management cable <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is connected to an optical coupler <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> which is disposed on a transmission path, through a cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is disposed on a transmission path on which two network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are connected to each other. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> branches the transmission signals without influencing the communication contents which flow in the transmission path. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> outputs the branched transmission signals to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> extracts an IP packet in accordance with the signal acquired from the transmission path, and calculates the traffic statistic values in each predetermined time period. When the SNMP message is outputted from the management station Z to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> generates a message corresponding to the SNMP message, and outputs it to the management station Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In case of taking the management system based on the example (1) (management station X), an amount of the SNMP messages (SNMP packets) to be transferred, which are required for the management increases when the number of the network devices managed by the management station increases. That is, an amount of the SNMP packets to be transferred, which flow in the IP based network to be managed, increases. As a result, the following problems are caused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At first, the load of a relay network device for relaying the communication between the management station and the network device to be managed, increases. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the load of the network device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for relaying the communication between the management station X and the network device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, or those of the network devices <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which relay the communication between the management station X and the network device <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Secondly, there is some possibility that the SNMP packets which are exchanged between the management station and each network device to be managed, are cancelled in the relay network device. In general, the SNMP packet for transmitting only the management information, has a lower priority lower than a normal communication packet to be transmitted among the network devices of the IP based network. Accordingly, as the traffic is congested on the IP based network, there is some possibility that the network devices cancel the SNMP packet on the basis of the priority which is set in each network device. As described above, there is a risk that the SNMP packets are cancelled, when SNMP messages are exchanged between the network devices and the management station through the IP based network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the third place, it is required for the network device to be managed to generate the SNMP packets for the management station as well as to carry out an original communication processing as a device on the IP based network. As a result, there is some possibility that an original performance of the network device to be managed deteriorates when the communication traffic increases in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For the above reasons, like the management station X shown inn <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the above-mentioned IP based network management method that the network device to be managed is loaded and that a frequency band of the operating IP based network is used, is disadvantageous, particularly, to a high-speed network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned management system based on the example (2) (management station Y), it is possible for the management station to certainly obtain the stored information and the error information of one network device which is connected to the management station, without the influence of the relay network device. However, in the above-mentioned example (2), it is not possible for the management station to directly grasp the status of the network devices on the IP based network except one connected to the management station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned management system based on the example (3) (management station Z), because the management station exchanges the SNMP massage with the probe apparatus through a cable for management, there is not a risk that the SNMP message is cancelled in the relay network device. Furthermore, it is possible to monitor the status of each network device without influencing the communications in the transmission path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, in the manage system using the probe apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, because the transmission path on which the probe apparatus can collect the information, is predetermined, it is difficult to rapidly grasp the status of the traffic in the entire IP based network, which continually varies. For example, it is desired to change the positions of the transmission path to be monitored, with a lapse of time in accordance with the variation of the traffic in the IP based network. In this case, when the traffic is tracked at a plurality of positions to be monitored, in accordance with the variation of the status, it is necessary to locate the probe apparatuses at all of the expected positions to be monitored, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described above, the management system according to the example (3) is not a rational one because it is necessary to provide the sufficient number of probe apparatuses, although it is possible to objectively obtain the precise management information. Further, it is not possible to deal with the dynamic variation of the IP based network. There is a problem that the IP based network cannot be efficiently managed nor cannot be efficiently divided during fault occurrence, when the IP based network is managed by the limited number of probe apparatuses. </paragraph>

Therefore, it is possible to manage all of the points on the IP based network without measuring all of the monitor signals on the IP based network at the same time, by changing the monitor signal to be measured in case of necessity, when the statistic information of the monitor signal is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The probe apparatus may further comprise: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> a remote control signal receiving section for receiving a remote control signal from one or more external sections; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the probe apparatus controls the channel selection in accordance with the remote control signal which is supplied from the remote control signal receiving section. That is, it is possible to determine the channel to be selected by the optical channel selector, in accordance with the remote control signal supplied from the remote control signal receiving section. Furthermore, it is possible to measure the statistic information of the monitor signal of the selected channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The remote control signal receiving section may comprise a plurality of connecting members for connecting the plurality of external sections, and receives anyone of the remote control signals outputted from the plurality of external sections. </paragraph>

The optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are connected to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through optical fiber cables, respectively. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through a management network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The management network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is one which is different from an IP based network <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>branch optical signals flowing in the optical transmission paths <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, respectively, to transmit them to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as monitor channel signals <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are disposed at each monitoring point of the IP based network to be managed. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is disposed at a monitoring point A of the IP based network <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed at a monitoring point B. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is disposed at a monitoring point C. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is disposed at a monitoring point D. The optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>transmit the branched monitor channel signals <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives the monitor channel signals <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>which are transmitted from all of the optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>connected thereto. The optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extracts one monitor channel signal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a plurality of received monitor channel signals <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the extracted monitor channel signal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a network monitor input signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> changes the optical channel signal to be extracted in accordance with a channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is outputted from a remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, when the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extracts the monitor channel signal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> processes traffic statistic information on the basis of the network monitor input signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> outputted from the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits the processed traffic statistic information to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> mainly comprises an O/E section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, an agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The O/E section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> converts the network monitor input signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> outputted from the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, into an electric signal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to output the converted electric signal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extracts an IP packet from the electric signal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is converted by the O/E section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> calculates the traffic statistic values in each predetermined time period to generate the traffic statistic information. Further, the traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> converts the generated traffic statistic information into an MIB format to generate traffic data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and to output it to the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through a bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has an interface function for the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is connected thereto through the management network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> transmits and receives an SNMP packet. When a signal for requesting the traffic data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is outputted from the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> converts the traffic data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> outputted from the traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, into packet information in accordance with the SNMP, in order to transmit the packet information to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Further, the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generates a control signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> based on the content of instruction or inquiry signal which is received from the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The control signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is outputted from the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generates a remote control signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output it to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> when a remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> generates the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in accordance with the remote control signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputted from the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, to transmit it to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is arranged as an independent casing from the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a GP-IB interface (IEEE-488) or any one of serial interfaces is used for the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so as to adapt it for the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is one for managing the IP based network <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on the basis of the SNMP packet transmitted from the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> requires the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to transmit the traffic data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to collect the traffic data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> grasps the status of the IP based network <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on the basis of the collected traffic data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Further, the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> transmits the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may automatically carryout the transmission process of the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the basis of an analysis result of the traffic data. Alternatively, the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may carry out the above transmission process on the basis of an instruction inputted by a supervisor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, an applicable example of the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a view for illustrating an example in which the network management system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied to the IP based network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be managed. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the IP based network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises two core rooters <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and four edge rooters <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is disposed at the monitor point A on the optical transmission path <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by which core rooters <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are connected to each other. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed at the monitor point B between the core rooter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the edge rooter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is disposed at the monitor point C between the core rooter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the edge rooter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is disposed at the monitor point D between the core rooter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the edge rooter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. An optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>y </italic></highlight>is disposed at a monitor point Y between the core rooter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the edge rooter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The edge rooter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a probe apparatus according to an earlier development. Hereinafter, it is referred to as &ldquo;earlier-developed probe apparatus&rdquo;. The earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through a management interface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stores the traffic data between the core rooter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the edge rooter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the basis of the monitor channel signal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>y </italic></highlight>which is branched by the optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>y </italic></highlight>to input it thereinto. Then, the earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> transmits the traffic data to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through a cable <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is one according to the present invention. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a configuration explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and is connected to the optical channel selector having an independent casing. Further, the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. That is, the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having four input ports which correspond to the input signals of the optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> monitors the communications at the monitor points A to D where the optical couplers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Further, the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the management network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. That is, the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> generates the traffic statistic information on the basis of the network monitor input signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is transmitted from the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> converts the traffic statistic information into the information based on the SNMP to store it therein. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits the stored information as the SNMP packet to the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in accordance with the requirement signal transmitted from the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> generates the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to output it to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> receives the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is transmitted from the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, it is assumed that a default monitor point of the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the monitor point A. When the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is not received from the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> always extracts the monitor channel signal at the monitor point A between the core rooters <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is received from the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the channel of the optical selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is changed from the monitor point B to the monitor point D between the core rooter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the edge rooters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In order to simplify the explanation in the following description, the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a 2 bit signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a table for illustrating an example of the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. According to the table, the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> selects the monitor channel signal outputted from the optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> represents &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Similarly, the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> selects the optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>when the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> outputted from the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> represents &ldquo;1&rdquo;. When the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> represents &ldquo;2&rdquo;, the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> selects the optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> represents &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> selects the optical coupler <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The case in which the IP based network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is managed by using the earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, is explained. In the following description, it will be assumed that the traffic statistic value sharply increases with a lapse of time at the monitor point Y where the earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> monitors communication and that the traffic statistic value exceeds a predetermined threshold value SL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> are graphs for illustrating the variation of the traffic statistic value as a function of a lapse of time. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows the variation of the traffic statistic value which is detected by the earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the variation of the traffic statistic value which is detected by the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, an abscissa axis represents a lapse of time. An ordinate axis represents a traffic amount of the IP packet per unit time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the traffic statistic value detected by the earlier-developed probe apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the monitor point Y sharply increases at the time t<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>to and reaches the threshold value SL at the time t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In order to search the cause of the trouble, the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> stops the collecting process for the traffic statistic information at the monitor point A, which the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> carries out in an initial state. Then, the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> transmits the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> carries out the collecting process for the traffic statistic information at the monitor point B. The agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> receives the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to generate the remote control signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to output it to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> representing &ldquo;1&rdquo;, to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the traffic statistic value at the monitor point B does not correspond to the traffic statistic value at the monitor point Y since the time t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs, to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for changing the monitor channel from the monitor point B to the monitor point C. The remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> representing &ldquo;2&rdquo;, to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> However, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the traffic is not observed at the monitor point C. It is found that few packet is inputted into or outputted from the edge rooter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> since the time t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> further transmits, to the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for changing the monitor channel from the monitor point C to the monitor point D. The remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> representing &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When the monitor channel is changed to the monitor point D, it is judged that a traffic trouble observed at the monitor point Y is caused by exchanging a large amount of IP packets between the edge rooter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the core rooter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. By checking the edge rooter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in accordance with the result of the monitoring and by tracing the route of the traffic, for example, the problems in the ISP apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is possible to rapidly detect a cause of the traffic trouble in comparison with the monitor system according to an earlier development by using the optical channel selector and the probe apparatus according to the present invention in a process of tracing the cause that the traffic abnormally increases. Further, because the monitor channel signals branched by a plurality of optical couplers are switched by the optical selector to detect them, for example, it is possible to thoroughly obtain the traffic statistics at all of the set monitor points by monitoring the communications at the monitor points around the specific network device at each timing in the IP based network to be managed. More particularly, in case of the probe apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is possible to obtain the traffic statistics at four points by using one probe apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> when the optical channels to be monitored are always changed in an order of points A, B, C, D, A, . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and may be applied to various modified embodiments. For example, in the above-described embodiment, the management station transmits the remote control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the probe apparatus. The agent processing section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> outputs the remote control signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, so that the optical channel selector changes the monitor channel. However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, a terminal device which is different from the management station may directly output the remote control signal to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the supervisor may directly output the command to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> without using a remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example for illustrating a configuration in which the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to a terminal device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and an operation device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The probe apparatus <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises an O/E section <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a traffic measuring section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, an agent processing section <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and a remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> denotes an electric signal into which the network monitor input signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is converted by the O/E section <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> denotes a traffic data, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> denotes a control signal and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> denotes a channel changing signal. The terminal device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> of the probe apparatus <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through a network <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The operation device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is directly connected to the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> by a cable. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> receives not only a remote control signal &agr; outputted from the management station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the agent processing section <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, but also a remote control signal &bgr; outputted from the terminal device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and a remote control signal &ggr; outputted from the operation device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> outputs the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to the optical channel selector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> even when one of the remote control signals &agr; to &ggr; is inputted into the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. In other words, the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> has a function of wired OR for each bit of the remote control signals &agr; to &ggr; to carry out the same operation even when any one of the remote control signals &agr; to &ggr; is inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> gives a priority to each remote control signal. When two or more remote control signals are inputted into the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> at the same time or in a short time, the remote control interface section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may compare one remote control signal with another to output the remote control signal having a superior priority as the channel changing signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the operation device may comprise a switch for selecting a status that only the inputted remote control signal &agr; or the inputted remote control signal &bgr; is effective, or a status that only the inputted remote control signal &ggr; generated by the operation device is effective. That is, in accordance with the setting of the switch, the operation device may switch a status that the inputted remote control signal &agr; or &bgr; which is transmitted from the management station or the terminal device is effective, or a status that the inputted remote control signal &ggr; which is outputted from the operation device is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention, the operation device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for generating the remote control signal &ggr; is arranged so as to be independent of the prove apparatus. However, the operation device may be incorporated into the probe apparatus. Furthermore, in the embodiment, the optical channel selector is arranged so as to be independent of the probe apparatus. However, the optical channel selector may be incorporated into the probe apparatus. In the embodiment, the probe apparatus is connected to the terminal device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for generating the remote control signal &bgr;, through the network. However, the probe apparatus may be connected to the terminal device through a single cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to control the monitor signal extracted from a plurality of monitor signals received by the optical channel selector. As a result, it is possible to select any one from all of the monitor signals on the IP based network to be managed, and to change the monitor signal to be measured in case of necessity. </paragraph>
