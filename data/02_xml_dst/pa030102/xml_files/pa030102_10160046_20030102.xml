<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a switching circuit, at least two bus bars are fixed with an insulator interposed therebetween and secured to a substrate of the switching circuit. Being combined with the bus bars, the insulator serves not only to insulate those bus bars but also to enhance the bending rigidity and bending strength of the switching circuit. As current flows in one of the bus bars in a direction opposite to a direction in which current flows in the other bus bar, the inductance of the bus bars is reduced, resulting in the decreased fly-back voltage generated upon switching operation. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a switching circuit provided with a plurality of bus bars serving as a conductor for coupling a switching element to a power source or a load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Generally a metallic bus bar is well known as a conductor having a cross section area large enough to allow electric current to flow between circuit elements or between a circuit element and a power source or between a circuit element and a load in a power circuit such as a switching circuit for an inverter motor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing a generally employed switching circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serving as an inverter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a plan view of the switching circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the switching circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> takes the form of a three-phase inverter having switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, such as IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor), and diodes D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected in parallel with the corresponding switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Each of the switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is opened and closed in accordance with a control signal sent from a control unit (not shown). In response to opening or closing of the switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the direct current applied from a direct-current power source <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is converted into a three-phase alternating current. The three-phase alternating current, then, is supplied to a three-phase inverter motor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> serving as the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the switching circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has power source side bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>N) between the switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the power source (not shown), and has load side bus bars <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>U, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>V, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>W) between the switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the respective phases (U-phase, V-phase, W-phase) at the load side. Each of the power source side bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed into a frame-like shape defined by longitudinal members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C and lateral members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>R. The longitudinal members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C are inserted into a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is then subjected to resin molding, so that the longitudinal members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C are embedded in the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Like the longitudinal members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C, the lateral members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>R are embedded in the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> except the upper surface. The upper surface of the lateral member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>R is exposed on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a surface to which wires are bonded for connection with the switching elements S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Embedding of the bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>N in the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> makes it possible to enhance a flexural rigidity and flexural strength of the switching circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, insulation between adjacent bus bars, for example, bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>N, or the bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>N and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>U, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>V, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>W can be secured, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Each of the load-side bus bars <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed as a strip member that laterally extends on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The switching members S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are provided on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between the lateral members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>R of the power source side bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the load side bus bars <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The respective ends, upper and lower ends shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, of the switching members S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected to the lateral members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>R and the load-side bus bars <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> via wires <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The wires <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are bonded to the respective bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through ultrasonic bonding. More specifically, in the state where the metallic wires are pressed onto the bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, each portion of contacts between the metallic wires and the bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is oscillated using ultrasound. Accordingly the wires <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are bonded onto the surface of the bus bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, the aforementioned switching circuit formed by insert-molding of the bus bars (power source side) into the substrate has caused various problems. For example, as a flow path of the resin becomes complicated during the insert molding, the resultant switching circuit may be deformed or cracked. Furthermore the inserted bus bars may be deformed by the temperature rise during the resin molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, adjacent bus bars are kept insulated by inserting the bus bars into an insulating resin, that is, covering the peripheral area of the bus bars with the resin material. However, this may increase the size of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When a certain failure occurs during resin molding of the substrate, a gap may be generated in a portion of the substrate on which the lateral member of the inserted bus bar (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>R shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, for example) abuts. This may prevent the bus bars from being insulated, or cause difference in the oscillating state or the temperature rise during ultrasonic bonding between the portion with the gap and the portion with no gap. As a result, the bonding strength or the resistance value may vary depending on the bonded portion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A switching circuit according to an embodiment of the invention includes a plurality of switching elements and a plurality of bus bars each serving as a conductor. The bus bars connect the switching elements to one of a power source and a load. Two or more of the plurality of bus bars are fixed to each other with an insulator interposed between adjacent ones of the two or more bus bars. The two or more of the plurality of bus bars with the insulator interposed therebetween are secured to a substrate of the switching circuit. As the aforementioned circuit requires no insert molding of the bus bars, the process for producing the switching circuit may be simplified, reducing the time and cost for producing the circuit. As the resin used for producing the circuit can be reduced, the resultant circuit may be compact and light. A plurality of bus bars are fixed with insulators interposed therebetween, thus preventing deformation of the bus bar itself. Furthermore, the combined bus bars and the insulators may serve as a reinforcing member of the substrate. Accordingly, the flexural rigidity and flexural strength of the switching circuit can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Two of the plurality of bus bars are fixed to each other with the insulator interposed therebetween. Current flows in one of the two bus bars in a direction opposite to a direction in which current flows in the other bus bar. In the switching circuit provided with the bus bars, an induced voltage (fly-back) generated during switching is increased by inductance distributed in the bus bars. This may prevent the switching circuit from conducting high-speed switching. According to the aforementioned aspect of the invention, however, the magnetic fields generated around the adjacent bus bars can be offset by current flowing along the bus bar in the opposite directions. The inductance of the bus bars, thus, can be reduced.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention will be described referring to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a plan view showing an essential portion of a switching circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of an embodiment of the invention. The direction of y-axis in figure such as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be hereinafter called as a longitudinal direction, and the direction of x-axis in the figure will be hereinafter called as a lateral direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The switching circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> serves to convert direct current into three-phase current (U-phase, V-phase, W-phase) as a circuit equivalent to an inverter as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the switching circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N) connected to a power source (not shown), and a plurality of bus bars (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>U, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>V, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>W) connected to a load (not shown).

The stacked structure will be described in detail later. Each of the aforementioned bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be formed of a metallic member, for example, copper. The insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed of, for example, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), PBT (polybutyleneterephthalate) or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Switching elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed on gaps between the lateral member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>PR and the bus bar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and between the lateral member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>NR and the bus bar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, arranged in order from the upper side to the lower side of the switching circuit in the figure are a switching element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>PU between the positive electrode and the U-electrode at load side, a switching element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>NU between the negative electrode and the U-electrode at load side, a switching element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>NV between the negative electrode and the V-electrode at load side, a switching element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>PV between the positive electrode and the V-electrode at load side, a switching element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>PW between the positive electrode and the W-electrode at load side, and a switching element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>NW between the negative electrode and the W-electrode at load side. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is interposed between the longitudinal member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>NC of the negative electrode side bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N as the upper side and the longitudinal member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>PC of the positive electrode side bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P as the lower side. The insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> serves to prevent electric current from flowing between the bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N. Positions of the bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N are aligned with a positioning pin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is formed of the insulating material and inserted into the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N and the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are adhered with the adhesive. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, both ends of the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided with protrusions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>E each extending vertically in an opposite direction with respect to the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The positive electrode-side bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P and the negative electrode-side bus-bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N are fitted in the portion above and below the isolator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Accordingly the protrusions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>E serve to align positions of the bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned structure of the bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N having the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween, the direction of electric current that flows through the bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P is different from that of electric current flowing through the bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N. In the embodiment, the aforementioned bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N are structured to extend in the same direction (longitudinal direction) so as to be connected to the power source at the same side (left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, lower side in FIG. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). As a result, the electric current flows through the negative electrode side bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N in the direction designated as n (from right to left), and the electric current flows through the positive electrode side bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P in the direction designated as p (from left to right). The magnetic field generated around the bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P has a rotating direction opposite to that of the magnetic field generated around the bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N. The aforementioned structure may reduce inductance generated in the bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N, thus minimizing fly-back voltage upon switching. Accordingly this may realize higher switching speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited by the aforementioned embodiment in which one insulator is interposed between two bus bars over a whole length of those bus bars. Alternatively, the insulator may be interposed between two bus bars only partially, or a plurality of insulators are intermittently interposed between the bus bars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, a plurality of bus bars are stacked on the substrate via the insulator in a vertical direction thereto. Alternatively, the bus bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>P, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>N may be arranged on the substrate in parallel via the insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this case, the second moment of area of the bus bar may be enhanced by forming the section of the bus bar into an L-like shape so as to improve flexural rigidity and flexural strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiment, each rear surface of the bus bars (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>PR, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>NR, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>U, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>V or <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>W) subjected to the ultrasonic bonding is brought into tight contact with the upper surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the bus bar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may have portions that are not subjected to the ultrasonic bonding, for example, both ends of the bus bar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, supported with the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to form a gap between the bus bar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This structure allows the oscillating state or the temperature rise at a plurality of bonded portions to be uniform, reducing variation of the bonding strength and resistance value of the wire. The structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> may be applied to the bus bars (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>PR, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>NR, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>U, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>V, or <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>W) of the switching circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the embodiment according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiment, the bus bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has two different portions, the portion subjected to the wire bonding (longitudinal members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>PC, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>NC), and the portion to be stacked via the insulator (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>PR, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>NR). Alternatively, the same members of the bus bar may be subjected to wire bonding at a position close to the fixation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is a plan view showing an example of stacking the <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R via the insulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the bus bars to be fixed via the insulator as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. In this example, the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R are fixed with a bolt <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and a nut <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which are inserted through the insulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at a position close to the surface subjected to the wire bonding, that is, the wire bonding area. In this example, a washer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> formed of an insulating material and a spacer (not shown) formed of the insulating material and inserted into a hole of the bolt that fixes the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R may bring the nut <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in contact with the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R so as to prevent electric current from flowing between the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R. In this example, the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R are on the same plane, and positioned at the same height from the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (the surface on which the switching elements are placed). This structure may allow the wire bonding of the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R to be performed in substantially the same conditions, thus reducing variation in the bonded state of a plurality of positions of the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R. In this example, the bus bars <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R are bent so as to enhance the second moment of area to bending in the longitudinal direction. As the direction of the electric current flowing through the bus bar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>L is opposite to that of the electric current flowing through the bus bar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>R, the inductance may be reduced. The structure may be realized by combining the aforementioned examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned embodiment requires no embedding of the bus bars in the resin for insulating purpose. Additionally the embodiment allows enhancement of flexural rigidity and flexural strength, thus making the bus bar further light and compact. </paragraph>
