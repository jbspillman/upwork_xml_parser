<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of acoustical and thermal insulation and, more particularly, to an under carpet shield and floor pan insulator for a vehicle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Acoustical and thermal insulators and liners for application to vehicles are well known in the art. These insulators typically rely upon both sound absorption, i.e. the ability to absorb incident sound waves and transmission loss, i.e. the ability to reflect incident sound waves, in order to provide sound attenuation. They also rely upon thermal shielding properties to prevent or reduce the transmission of heat from various heat sources (e.g. engine, transmission and exhaust system), to the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Such insulation is commonly employed as an under carpet heat shield and a floor pan insulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Examples of acoustical and thermal insulation in the form of liners are disclosed in a number of prior art patents including U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,851,283 to Holtrop et al. and 6,008,149 to Copperwheat. As should be apparent from a review of these two patents, engineers have generally found it necessary to construct such liners from a laminate incorporating (a) one or more layers to provide the desired acoustical and thermal insulating properties and (b) one or more additional layers to provide some rigidity to allow ease of handling during installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,092,622 to Hiers et al. and 6,123,172 to Byrd et al. disclose needled composite thermal and acoustical insulators containing various layers of polymer fibers, glass fibers, metallic foils, scrims and other facings. The metallic foil facing is secured in place with an adhesive. The needling construction of the batt requires perforating the interior insulating layer, thereby providing numerous passageways for the passage of both heat and sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While a number of adhesives, adhesive webs and binding fibers have been specifically developed over the years to secure the various layers of the laminates together, laminated shields and insulators have an inherent risk of delamination and failure. The potential is, in fact, significant mainly due to the harsh operating environment to which the shields and insulators are subjected. Many shields and insulators are located near and/or are designed to shield high heat sources such as the engine, transmission and exhaust system. As a result, the shields and insulators are often subjected to temperatures in excess of 200&deg; F. which have a tendency to degrade the adhesives and binders over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Shields and insulators used for under carpet and floor pan applications also carry foot traffic and thus are subjected to repeated compression and decompression. This activity places very significant strain on the shields and insulators, often resulting in adhesive failure and delamination of the shield or insulator over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A need is therefore identified for an under carpet heat shield/floor pan insulator incorporating a nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer of polymer fibers suitable for use in the proximity of high temperature heat sources such as an exhaust system and particularly a catalytic converter and capable of providing the desired acoustical and thermal insulating properties. Advantageously, such an insulator also provides the desired mechanical strength and rigidity to allow simple and convenient installation while also providing a long service life characterized by reliable performance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an under carpet heat shield/floor pan insulator for a vehicle. That shield/insulator comprises a single, nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer of polymer fiber selected from a group consisting of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, nylon and any mixtures thereof. The thermal insulating layer is preferably a nonwoven fabric and may further include additional fibers selected from a group consisting of glass fibers and natural fibers to meet the specific performance requirements of a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention the acoustical and thermal insulating layer may include a relatively high density, nonlaminate skin of polymer fiber along at least one face thereof. Still further, the insulator may include a first metal foil facing layer over a first face of the acoustical and thermal insulating layer. Similarly, a second metal foil facing layer may be provided over a second face of the acoustical and thermal insulating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> More specifically describing the invention, the under carpet heat shield and floor pan insulator of the present invention may comprise a single nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer of polymer fiber selected from a group consisting of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, nylon and any mixtures thereof that shows no signs of any thickness increase, delamination, deterioration or any undesirable effect which may affect performance when subjected to a temperature of about 150&deg; C. for a period of at least 330 hours. Still more specifically describing the invention, the shield/insulator may comprise a nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer of substantially 100% polyethylene terephthalate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The benefits and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following description wherein there is shown and described several preferred embodiments of this invention, simply by way of illustration of some of the modes best suited to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of still other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modification in various, obvious aspects all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawing and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawing. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> showing a first embodiment of the under carpet heat shield and floor pan insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of polymer fiber. More specifically, a single, nonlaminated layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with the necessary mechanical strength and rigidity to allow easy installation and the desired acoustical and thermal insulating properties. Advantageously, all of these benefits are achieved in a light weight insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which may even be used in compact vehicles where fuel economy concerns lead manufacturers to seek weight savings wherever possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The polymer fiber is not foamed and typically is a nonwoven fabric. The polymer fiber may be selected from a group of fibers consisting of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, nylon and any mixtures thereof. The acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is engineered to show no signs of any thickness increase, delamination, deterioration or any undesirable effect which may affect performance when subjected to a temperature of approximately 150&deg; C. for a period of at least 330 hours. Advantageously, such a shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a weight of between about 40-130 g/ft<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. For example, the acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may comprise substantially 100% polyethylene terephthalate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made from 100% polyethylene terephthalate provides a number of advantages when compared to a state of the art shield made from a layer of glass fibers sandwiched between layers of polyester. The shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be cut with a heat knife to give an edge. The shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be premolded to accommodate different shapes and sizes and will eventually mold to the cavity size even when the cavity is uneven. The state of the art shield cannot shape adapt to the mounting cavity in the bodywork or framework of the vehicle in a like manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, where the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is dimensionally stable upon exposure to temperatures up to 450&deg; F. at which slight yellowing may occur, the state of the art shield tends to disfigure and the phenolic binder is released, resulting in the production of an odor and browning of the shield. Of course, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is also free of glass fiber and, therefore, is installer friendly (does not produce an itchy feeling for those contacting the material). While the glass fiber in the state of the art product is sandwiched between two layers of polyester, the product still tends to be more irritating to those coming into contact with it. Accordingly, for many applications it is necessary to coat the edge of the shield or insulator in order to avoid this potential irritation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a first alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also comprises a nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of polymer fiber (e.g. a nonwoven fabric) selected from a group consisting of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, nylon and any mixtures thereof. The layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes a relatively high density, nonlaminate or unitary skin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of that polymer fiber along at least one face thereof. The formation of the relatively high density, nonlaminate skin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of polymer fiber may be completed in accordance with the process described in detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/607,478, entitled &ldquo;Process For Forming A Multi-Layer, Multi-Density Composite Insulator&rdquo;, filed Jun. 30, 2000 (Owens Corning Case Nos. 24811 and 24812). The full disclosure of this document is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the high density skin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will not delaminate from the layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under the environmental conditions existing under the carpet and along the floor pan of the vehicle and also adds structural integrity and strength to the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which aids significantly in handling and fitting the part during installation. The high density skin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also more aesthetically pleasing. Still further, for many applications the high density skin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> eliminates the need to provide an additional facing layer of another type of material. This serves to eliminate any potential failure of the shield or insulator due to delamination. It also results in a shield or insulator made exclusively from one material that is, therefore, readily recyclable. Further, since the skin may be formed with a hot platen during the molding of the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to its desired shape, no additional processing step is required. This reduces production cost relative to a shield or insulator with a facing since such a facing must be adhered to the acoustical and thermal insulating layer in a separate processing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer of polymer fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (e.g. a nonwoven fabric) selected from a group consisting of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, nylon and any mixtures thereof in combination with a metal foil facing layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over a first face <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the acoustical and thermal insulating layer. The metal foil facing may be present in one or more layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In yet another alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a nonlaminate acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of polymer fiber as described above in combination with a first metal foil facing layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> covering a first face <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> thereof and a second metal foil facing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> covering a second, opposite face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thereof. The second facing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed from the same or a different material as the first facing layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The first and second facing layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be attached to the layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by means of an appropriate adhesive or adhesive web in accordance with practices well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a single, nonlaminated acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of polymer fiber (e.g. a nonwoven fabric) as described above in combination with a first metal foil facing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> covering a first face thereof and a second metal foil facing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> covering a second face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thereof. Additionally, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes an additional acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of polymer fiber (e.g. a nonwoven fabric) selected from a group consisting of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon, nylon and any mixtures thereof. As a result, the first metal foil facing layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the two acoustical and thermal insulating layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In any of the embodiments described above and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the acoustical and thermal insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may further include from about 10-60 weight percent of glass and/or natural fibers such as, but not limited to E-glass, S-glass, kenaf, hemp and mixtures thereof. Use of such glass and natural fibers may be desirable to meet the performance parameters necessary for some potential applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In summary, numerous benefits result from employing the concepts of the present invention. An under carpet heat shield or floor pan insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention provides a unique combination of mechanical strength and rigidity as well as thermal and acoustical properties which are consistently and reliably maintained over a long service life even in the proximity of a high temperature heat source such as a catalytic converter. In one of the embodiments of the present invention, a relatively high density, nonlaminate skin is provided which aids in handling, is aesthetically pleasing and maintains the full recycleability of the shield or insulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, the shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could include a relatively high density nonlaminate skin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on both opposing faces and/or along the edges of the shield or insulator. Additionally, a shield or insulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with one or more high density, nonlaminate skins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could also include one or more facings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> if required to meet acoustical, thermal, structural and/or aesthetic performance requirements of a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The embodiment was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally and equitably entitled. </paragraph>
