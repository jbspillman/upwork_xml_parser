<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a film coating nozzle for applying coating material to a surface of a product such as a compressor piston, used in an arrangement which requires wear resistance and liquidtightness, and thereby forming film on the surface of the product, and an apparatus and a method for coating a compressor piston using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a film coating nozzle which can spread, by a dispenser method, applied coating material to form film of a uniform film thickness, and an apparatus and a method for coating a compressor piston using the same, which can coat the compressor piston through a series of continuous processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a product such as a compressor piston used in an arrangement requiring wear resistance and liquidtightness is coated on its surface with film of a predetermined thickness. This coating technique has already been employed in various industrial fields. As well known in the art, in this coating technique, it is important that the thickness be uniform over the entire surface of the applied film. Specifically, while, for example, a Teflon coating is applied to a circumferential outer surface of a head part of the compressor piston, upon coating the compressor piston, a thickness and uniformity of a coated film greatly influence the performance of a compressor, and therefore should be carefully controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As coating methods for improving wear resistance and liquidtightness of a compressor piston, powder coating, spraying or electrostatic painting are well known in the art. However, these coating methods suffer from disadvantages in that variance in thickness of coated film is substantial. In particular, in a spray coating method, since a coating process is involved and sprayed coating material spatters, regions which do not require application of coating material are also coated with coating material and thus, coating material is excessively wasted. Further, in the spray coating method, a surrounding environment is polluted by coating material which spatters during a coating procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To cope with these problems occurring in the conventional spray coating method, coating apparatuses are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Heisei 8-173893 and International Patent Application No. PCT/JP00/00096. Each of the coating apparatuses has a rotation support device which rotatably supports a cylindrical product to be coated, a coating material injecting device which is installed above the rotation support device in such a way as to be moved upward and downward and has a nozzle for applying coating material to a circumferential outer surface of the product rotated by the rotation support device, and a blade which spreads to a uniform film thickness coating material applied to the circumferential outer surface of the product by the coating material injecting device in such a way as to remove excess coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional coating apparatuses still encounter problems in that, since the blade for removing excess coating material applied to the circumferential outer surface of the cylindrical product must be installed separately from the nozzle at a position adjoining the rotating cylindrical product, a construction of each coating apparatus as a whole is complex. Moreover, because driving and controlling of the blade serving as a coating material spreading device is complicated, maintenance and repair costs and time of the coating apparatus are increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the conventional coating apparatuses, while it is possible to apply coating material, for example, to a circumferential outer surface of a head part of a compressor piston, it is impossible to apply coating material to a bridge part of a piston for a fixed displacement swash plate type compressor or wing parts of a piston for a variable displacement swash plate type compressor. For this reason, in the conventional art, a coating process for the bridge part or wing parts should be performed by a spraying method, in a state wherein the piston which is coated with coating material on its circumferential outer surface is moved to another place or apparatus. Hence, by the fact that two different methods are employed, operation control for the entire coating apparatus is made further complicated. Also, inherent problems of the spray coating method, which are related with increase in coating material consumption and pollution of surrounding devices due to spatter of coating material, still exist. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to allow coating material to be spread at the same time with application, by coating material spreading means integrally formed with a nozzle, to thereby form film of a uniform thickness, whereby the need for a separate blade for removing excess coating material is obviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide coating material spreading means formed integrally with a nozzle, to thereby simplify an entire construction of a coating apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a coating apparatus and method which allow a head part, a bridge part or wing parts as a frictional part of a compressor piston to be coated through a series of continuous processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a film coating nozzle comprising: a nozzle body configured to supply coating material; and at least one coating material spreading means defined with at least one coating material injection hole which is communicated with the inside of the nozzle body, and formed integrally with the nozzle body to spread to a uniform film thickness coating material applied through the coating material injection hole to a surface of a product, in such a way as to remove excess coating material. Here, the film coating nozzle according to this aspect of the present invention will be referred to as a &ldquo;first nozzle&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The first nozzle can be appropriately used to coat a circumferential outer surface of a cylindrical product to be coated, for example, a circumferential outer surface of a piston for a wobble plate type compressor. Due to the provision of the first nozzle, without installing the nozzle and a blade separately from each other, since it is possible to apply coating material by the coating material spreading means formed integrally with the nozzle body, and at the same time spread to a uniform film thickness applied coating material and thereby remove excess coating material, the need for the separate blade and means for driving and controlling the separate blade is obviated. Thus, constructional simplification of an entire coating apparatus can be accomplished, and the number of checkpoints for maintenance and repair of the coating apparatus can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the first nozzle, it is preferred that the coating material spreading means has a width which is equal to or slightly greater than that of a portion of the product, which is to be coated. Also, the at least one coating material injection hole defined in the coating material spreading means may comprise a single slot, a plurality of independent holes, or a combination thereof. The number and contour of the coating material injection holes can be changed depending upon a configuration of a product to be coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case that the product to be coated comprises a compressor piston, an annular groove is defined on a circumferential outer surface of a head part of the piston. In this connection, it is preferred that a projection is formed at a position on a lower end surface of the coating material spreading means, which position corresponds to the annular groove, so as to control an amount of coating material applied in the annular groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the lower end surface of the coating material spreading means is formed as an inclined surface having a predetermined inclination angle to ensure easy spreading of coating material. While it is preferred that, when a surface of the coating material spreading means which is positioned upstream in a rotating direction of the product is assumed to be a front surface, the inclined surface is inclined downward from the front surface toward a rear surface, it can also be envisaged that the inclined surface is inclined downward from the rear surface toward the front surface. Also, while it is preferred that the inclination angle of the inclined surface is within the range of an acute angle, it is to be readily understood that the present invention is not limited to such a provision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a film coating nozzle adapted for coating a product, for example, a bridge part of a piston for a fixed displacement swash plate type compressor, comprising: a nozzle body configured to supply coating material; and a pair of coating material spreading means each defined with at least one coating material injection hole which is communicated with the inside of the nozzle body, and formed integrally at both sides of the nozzle body to spread to a uniform film thickness coating material applied through coating material injection holes to surfaces of the bridge part in such a way as to remove excess coating material, each coating material spreading means having a lower end surface which conforms to a surface contour of the bridge part. Here, the film coating nozzle according to this aspect of the present invention will be referred to as a &ldquo;second nozzle&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the second nozzle, it is preferred that each coating material spreading means has a width which is equal to or slightly greater than that of a portion of the bridge part of the piston, which is to be coated. Also in the second nozzle, the at least one coating material injection hole defined in each coating material spreading means may comprise a single slot, a plurality of independent holes, or a combination thereof. The number and contour of the coating material injection holes can be changed depending upon a configuration of a product to be coated. Further, while the second nozzle coats the product to be coated while being slid on the bridge part of the piston for the fixed displacement swash plate type compressor, the bridge part serving as the product to be coated, in order to ensure easy spreading of coating material, the lower end surface of each coating material spreading means can be formed as an inclined surface which is inclined in a direction opposite to movement of the second nozzle by a predetermined inclination angle. While it is preferred that the inclination angle of the inclined surface is within the range of an acute angle, it is to be readily understood that the present invention is not limited to such a provision. Further, in the second nozzle, it is preferred that a guide post is formed integrally with the nozzle body so that it is brought into sliding contact with the product to be coated, to prevent the second nozzle from fluctuating during movement thereof and allow film of a uniform thickness to be formed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A film coating nozzle in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference>. Here, the film coating nozzle according to this first embodiment of the present invention will be referred to as a &ldquo;first nozzle&rdquo; for the sake of clarity of explanation and designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is detachably coupled to a coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and constitutes a coating apparatus used for coating the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is raised and lowered by the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> coats the head part H by injecting coating material to the head part H of each of the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is rotated by rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), and at the same time spreading to a uniform film thickness coating material applied to the head part H and thereby removing excess coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> comprises a nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which is formed integrally with the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is detachably coupled to the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and is defined with a coating material injection hole (not shown) which is communicated with the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, whereby the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can supply coating material from the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through the coating material injection hole. A plurality of threaded holes (not shown) are defined in the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in a manner such that bolts can be driven into the threaded holes to fasten the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The coating material injection hole communicated with the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is defined at substantially a center portion of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As can be readily seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is defined with at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which is communicated with the coating material injection hole of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, coating material can be injected from the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, to be applied to the circumferential outer surface of the head part H of each of the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this first embodiment of the present invention, the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be formed integrally with the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, or can be formed separately form the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and then integrally assembled thereto. As can be readily understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 8</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has a width which is equal to or slightly greater than that of a portion of the head part H of each of the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is to be coated. Due to this fact, coating material applied to the circumferential outer surface of the head part H can be spread by the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to a uniform film thickness as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> while excess coating material is removed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. That is to say, while, in the conventional art, a nozzle and a blade are installed separately from each other and driven and controlled by separate means, in the present invention, since the head part H can be coated by the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in which the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is formed integrally with the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the need for the separate blade and means for driving and controlling the separate blade is obviated. Therefore, advantages are provided in that it is possible to simplify an entire construction of the coating apparatus as will be described later in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As described above, at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be defined in the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In this regard, a variety of contours of the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> can be adopted according to the present invention. While it is preferred that the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is defined to extend through the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in a vertical direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, to thereby be communicated with the coating material injection hole of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> needs not be defined to extend through the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. For example, while not shown in the drawings, in the case that each of the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated in a direction indicated by the arrows as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the object of the present invention can be sufficiently achieved so long as the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is located in front of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, that is, at a right side of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> defined in the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may have a variety of contours. In the case that a plurality of coating material injection holes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are defined, they can be located in diversity of manners. In an example, the at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may comprise a single slot as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Also, the at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality of independent holes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this case, depending upon a configuration or a structure of the product to be coated, that is, the compressor piston, the independent holes can be defined so that they are constantly spaced apart as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, or they have diameters which are gradually increased or decreased in a direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. In addition, the at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may comprise a combination of a single slot and independent holes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, or a plurality of differently sized holes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> lower end surface of the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be formed as an inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> having a predetermined inclination angle &thgr; to ensure that coating material applied to the head part H can be easily spread and thereby excess coating material can be easily removed. When a surface of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which is positioned upstream in a rotating direction of each of the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is assumed to be a front surface, while it preferred that the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is inclined downward from the front surface toward a rear surface, the present invention is not limited by such a provision. That is to say, even in the case that the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is inclined downward from the rear surface toward the front surface, since each of the pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated through a multitude of revolutions while being coated, the object of the present invention can be reliably achieved. In other words, by a sharpened edge of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, excess coating material can be removed in such a way as to be spread to a uniform film thickness. It is to be noted that the object of the present invention can be achieved even without forming the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the inclination angle of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is within the range of an acute angle. More preferably, the inclination angle of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is within the range of 5&tilde;45&deg;. Most preferably, the inclination angle of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 25&deg;. However, because the object of the present invention can be sufficiently achieved even without forming the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, the present invention is not limited in any fashion by provision of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When considering the fact that the annular groove G in which oil flows or a compression ring is fitted is usually defined on the circumferential outer surface of the head part H of each of the compressor pistons P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a thickness of film coated in the annular groove G must be taken into account as a matter of course. In this regard, in the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> projection <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is formed at a position on the lower end surface of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which position corresponds to the annular groove G, so as to control an amount of coating material applied in the annular groove G. Hence, a thickness of film coated on the circumferential outer surface of the head part H can be determined by a gap defined between a lower end of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the circumferential outer surface of the head part H, that is, a gap defined between the annular groove G and the projection <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. A size of the gap can be optimally adjusted by means (not shown) for raising and lowering the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Here, the film coating nozzle according to this second embodiment of the present invention will be referred to as a &ldquo;second nozzle&rdquo; for the sake of clarity of explanation and designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is detachably coupled to a coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which is installed to be moved upward and downward and slid laterally. The second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> constitutes a coating apparatus used for coating the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the fixed displacement swash plate type compressor. While being slid in an axial direction of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> coats the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by injecting coating material to the bridge part B, and at the same time spreading to a uniform film thickness coating material applied to the bridge part B and thereby removing excess coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> comprises a nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and a pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> which are integrally formed at both sides of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is detachably coupled to the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and is defined with a coating material injection hole (not shown) which is communicated with the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, whereby the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can supply coating material from the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through the coating material injection hole. Each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is defined with at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> which is communicated with the coating material injection hole of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, coating material can be injected from the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, to be applied to the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during sliding movement of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this second embodiment of the present invention, as can be readily seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the at least one coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can comprise a single slot, a plurality of independent holes, and a combination thereof. The number and contour of the coating material injection holes <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> can be changed depending upon a configuration of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the fixed displacement swash plate type compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> coats the bridge part B while being moved on the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that a lower end surface of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is formed to conform to a corresponding surface outline of the bridge part B to thereby ensure easy spreading of the coating material. Since, differently from the case of the head part H, the bridge part B is connected by a wobble plate, the bridge part B does not require liquidtightness but requires wear resistance. Also, the film coated on the bridge part B may undergo post-treatment such as a finishing or grinding process to have a uniform film thickness. Considering these facts, it is not necessary to limit a cross-sectional shape of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to a specified one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For example, the lower end surface of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may have a cross-sectional shape of an inclined straight line as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to conform to a corresponding surface outline of the bridge part B, or a cross-sectional shape of a first curved line having a curvature not conforming to the corresponding surface outline of the bridge part B. Alternatively, the lower end surface of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may have a cross-sectional shape of a line bent at plural points as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a cross-sectional shape of a second curved line having plural curvatures, or a cross-sectional shape of a combination of straight and curved lines. As a consequence, it is not necessary that the lower end surface of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> should have a specified cross-sectional shape conforming to the corresponding surface outline of the bridge part B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In detail, it can be considered that, since a portion of the bridge part B, which is to be coated, has a constant curvature in a theoretical point of view, the lower end surface of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> must be formed to have the same curvature as the portion to be coated to thereby accomplish a uniform film thickness. However, in this case, it is difficult to accomplish a uniform film thickness, due to conglomeration of coating material applied to the portion of the bridge part B under the action of surface tension or tensile force, coating material flow caused upon performing a drying or baking process, etc. From this standpoint, it is not contemplated that the lower end surface of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> be formed to have a cross-sectional shape precisely conforming to a corresponding surface outline of the bridge part B. Instead, another cross-sectional shape for accomplishing a uniform film thickness is adopted. For example, in order to prevent coating material from conglomerating adjacent to inner and outer edges of the bridge part B under the action of surface tension, the inner and outer edges of the bridge part B are covered by both side end protrusions of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, by which it is possible to prevent a film thickness from being increased on the inner and outer edges rather than on a middle portion of the bridge part B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also, in the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> has a width which is equal to or slightly greater than that of the portion of the bridge part B, which is to be coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the lower end surface of each coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can be formed as an inclined surface <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> which is inclined in a direction opposite to movement of the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> by a predetermined inclination angle. While it is preferred that, as in the case of the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the inclination angle of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> in the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is within the range of an acute angle, it is to be readily understood that the present invention is not limited to such a provision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the meanwhile, the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> constructed as mentioned above constitutes a coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as will be described later in detail. In a state wherein the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is lowered adjacent to the bridge part B, the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> applies coating material while being slid integrally with the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. At this time, while the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is slid, the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> must be prevented from fluctuating. To this end, the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> has at least one guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. The guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is formed integrally with the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in a manner such that its lower end is brought into sliding contact with the bridge part B. In this preferred embodiment, two guide posts <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are provided. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, it is preferred that the guide posts <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are respectively located in front of the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> when viewed in a moving direction of the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. While not shown in the drawings, instead of installing the two guide posts <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, only one guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be formed integrally with the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> between the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> in a manner such that a lower end thereof is brought into contact with the bridge part B. Due to the fact that the lower end of the guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is brought into sliding contact with the bridge part B, movement of the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is guided, and the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is prevented from fluctuating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The guide posts <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> having the lower ends, which are brought into contact with the bridge part B, function to determine a thickness of film applied to the bridge part B. To this end, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, each guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is formed to have a length which is greater than that of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, by which the lower end of each guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> extends downward beyond a lower end of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to be brought into sliding contact with the bridge part B. Thus, when the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is lowered, although the lower end of each guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the bridge part B, since the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are not brought into contact with the bridge part B, a gap defined between the bridge part B and the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is determined as a thickness of coated film. In this state wherein the guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the bridge part B, as the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are slid on the bridge part B, coating material is applied to the bridge part B, and at the same time is spread to a uniform film thickness in such a way as to remove excess coating material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A film coating nozzle in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12, 14</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Here, the film coating nozzle according to this third embodiment of the present invention will be referred to as a &ldquo;third nozzle&rdquo; for the sake of clarity of explanation and designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> according to this third embodiment of the present invention is adapted for coating a product to be coated, for example, such as both wing parts W of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor. The third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> can be constructed in the same manner as the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment of the present invention, except that lower ends of respective coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are formed to conform to both wing parts W, respectively, of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor, serving as the product to be coated. Accordingly, like reference numerals will be used to denote the same features as in the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When considering the fact that both wing parts W are respectively formed at both sides of the bridge part B in the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor, in the third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> according to this third embodiment of the present invention, it is preferred that only one guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is formed between the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the lower end of the guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is brought into sliding contact with the bridge part B which extends rearward from the head part H of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor and is connected with both wing parts W. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A compressor piston coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adapted for coating the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the fixed displacement swash plate type compressor using the first and second nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in this embodiment, the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a bridge part coating unit CB. Of course, in addition to the coating units CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CB, a number of other units, for example, for loading the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, unloading the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after coating of the head parts H is completed, loading the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the bridge part coating unit CB, and unloading the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the bridge part coating unit CB after coating of the bridge part B is completed, are provided to the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As for these other units, since they are the same as those in the conventional art, illustration and detailed explanation thereof shall be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a pair of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rotatably supports both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The pair of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are installed above the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in a manner such that they can be moved upward and downward. The pair of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> have a pair of first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, respectively, which apply coating material to circumferential outer surfaces of both head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rotated by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and at the same time spread to a uniform film thickness applied coating material and thereby remove excess coating material, in a state where the pair of first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are placed adjacent to the circumferential outer surfaces of both head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of support members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for supporting both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a rotation center, and rotation means (not shown) for rotating at least one of the support members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and thereby the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Since the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is constructed in the same manner as in the conventional art, detailed description thereof will omitted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Each first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to coat the circumferential outer surface of the head part H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be installed above the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by raising and lower means (not shown) to be moved upward and downward. The coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for controlling an amount of coating material supplied from coating material storing means, and the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> detachably coupled to the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in a state wherein a pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the pair of first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are lowered to be placed adjacent to the circumferential outer surfaces of both head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is supported and rotated by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, coating material is injected through the coating material injection holes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the circumferential outer surfaces of both head parts H, and at the same time is spread to a uniform film thickness in such a way as to remove excess coating material, whereby film having a desired thickness can be formed on the head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, as regards a thickness of film coated in the annular groove G, an amount of coating material applied in the annular groove G can be controlled by the projection <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> which is formed on the lower end surface of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the bridge part coating unit CB of the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> functions to coat the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after coating of both head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is completed by the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The bridge part coating unit CB includes fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is installed in the vicinity of the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to fixedly support both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is installed above the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it can be moved upward and downward and slid laterally. The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which applies coating material to the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and at the same time is slid to spread to a uniform film thickness applied coating material and thereby remove excess coating material, in a state where the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is placed adjacent to the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Differently from the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of fixing members <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for centrally fixing both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As for the construction of the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, since it is the same as in the conventional art, detailed description thereof shall be omitted. Here, since movement of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is implemented by unillustrated conventional conveying means, illustration and detailed explanation of the conveying means shall be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is configured to coat the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be installed above the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it can be moved upward and downward and slid laterally by unillustrated raising and lowering means and the conveying means. The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> comprises the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> for controlling an amount of coating material supplied from unillustrated coating material storing means, and the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> detachably coupled to the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is lowered, if the guide posts <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are brought into contact with the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is placed adjacent to the bridge part B, with a predetermined gap defined therebetween. In this state, coating material is injected through the coating material injection hole <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to the bridge part B. At the same time, as the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is slid, the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is moved in an axial direction of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Upon movement of the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, excess coating material applied to the bridge part B is spread to a uniform film thickness by the inclined surface <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the coating means spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and thereby removed, whereby film having a desired thickness can be formed on the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, a method for coating both head parts H and the bridge part B through a series of continuous processes by the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constructed as mentioned above will be synthetically described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> First, both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are rotatably supported by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Then, the pair of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are lowered so that coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of their respective first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are placed adjacent to both head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a predetermined gap. In this state, coating material is injected to the head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the pair of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> while the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is rotated, and the coating material applied to the head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is spread to a uniform film thickness and thereby excess coating material is removed, by the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In this way, it is possible to coat film having a uniform thickness on the circumferential outer surfaces of the head parts H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the course of coating the head parts H, a rotational velocity of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is rotated by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is not constant, but changed in a stepwise manner. Namely, an initial rotational velocity of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, measured while the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is initially rotated through one revolution from the time when coating material is initially injected to the head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, is set to be lower than a subsequent rotational velocity of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after the coating material is attached to the head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is rotated at a high velocity, coating material can be stably spread over the head parts H, and, as will be described later, applied coating material can be prevented from being attracted upward upon raising the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Also, even while the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is initially rotated through one revolution, a starting velocity is set to be higher than an ending velocity. The reason for this is to control through a rotational velocity a difference in a coating material injection amount between initial and final coating material injection stages, which cannot but be induced in the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Which one of a starting velocity and an ending velocity is set to be higher than the other through an initial first revolution is determined depending upon a kind of the coating material supply control valve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and other operational parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A first viscosity of the coating material applied to the head parts H is different from a second viscosity of the coating material applied to the bridge part B as will be described later. Preferably, the first viscosity of the coating material applied to the head parts H is greater than the second viscosity of the coating material applied to the bridge part B. For example, it is preferred that the first viscosity of the coating material applied to the head parts H is set to approximately 10,000&tilde;30,000 cp. The reason why coating material having a high viscosity is used for coating the head parts H is to allow a drying process to be implemented while not rotating the product to be coated. In this regard, in the case that coating material having a low viscosity is used for coating the head parts H, unless the product to be coated is rotated, a possibility of the coating material to flow downward is increased. Therefore, in order to ensure that a thickness and an amount of the coating material applied in a wet state to obtain a desired film thickness after drying and baking of the coating material are decreased and thereby a tendency of the coating material to flow is minimized, coating material having a high viscosity must be used for coating the head parts H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> If coating of both head parts H is completed as described above, the pair of first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are raised. Then, the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the coated head parts H is conveyed from the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> by the conveying means, and both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is lowered so that the guide posts <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are brought into contact with the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and thereby, respective coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are placed adjacent to the bridge part B with a predetermined gap. In this state, coating material is injected to the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> while the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is slid in an axial direction of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the respective coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> spread to a uniform film thickness coating material applied to the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and thereby remove excess coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the course of coating the bridge part B, a sliding speed of the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is not constant, but changed in a stepwise manner. Namely, a sliding speed of the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, when measured from the time that coating material is injected to the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in consideration of a coating material injection amount, is set to a high value at an initial stage, to a low value at an intermediate stage, and back again to a high value at a final stage. The reason why the sliding speed of the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is increased again at the final stage is to prevent coating material from being attracted upward upon raising the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, it is preferred that the coating material applied to the bridge part B has a viscosity, for example, of no greater than 10,000 cp, which is less than that of the coating material applied to the head part H. In this connection, while it is advantageous in view of storage and common use of coating material that coating material having the same viscosity as that applied to the head parts H is used to coat the bridge part B, in the case that the bridge part B does not undergo any specific post-treatment, it is difficult to satisfy the specification of the product, especially, in term of thickness. Hence, by decreasing a viscosity of the coating material used for coating the bridge part B, an amount of solid matter can be reduced, and management of the coating material can be easily implemented after drying and baking of the coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If coating for the bridge part B is completed, the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is raised again, and the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the coated bridge part B is unloaded by unillustrated unloading means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the above-described coating procedure implemented by the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, since different coating processes are simultaneously executed in the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the bridge part coating unit B, coating task for the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be performed through a series of continuous processes. Concretely speaking, in the conventional art, because it is impossible to coat the bridge part B by a dispenser method, after the head parts H of the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are coated by the dispenser method, the piston P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the coated head parts H must be moved to another place or arrangement where the bridge part B is coated by a spraying method. On the contrary, in the present invention, because the head part H and the bridge part B are continuously coated in the single coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, productivity can be significantly improved. Also, in the conventional art, a nozzle and a blade are installed separately from each other to be driven and controlled by their respective separate means. However, in the present invention, because the coating material spreading means is formed integrally with the nozzle, the need for the separate blade and means for driving and controlling the separate blade is obviated. As a consequence, constructional simplification and miniaturization of the entire coating apparatus are accomplished, and control can be implemented in an easy manner. Also, maintenance and repair costs and time of the coating apparatus can be decreased. </paragraph>

The rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rotatably supports both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is installed above the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it can be moved upward and downward. The first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which applies coating material to the circumferential outer surface of the head part H of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rotated by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and at the same time spreads to a uniform film thickness applied coating material and thereby removes excess coating material, in a state where the first nozzle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is placed adjacent to the circumferential outer surface of the head part H of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, except that the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the single first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> because the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor has the single head part H, the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is constructed in the same manner as the head part coating unit CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the previous embodiment. In this connection, since the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> were sufficiently explained in association with the previous embodiment, further concrete description thereof will omitted herein. </paragraph>

The wing part coating unit CW includes the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is installed in the vicinity of the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to fixedly support both ends of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is installed above the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it can be moved upward and downward and slid laterally. The second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> which applies coating material to both wing parts W of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and at the same time is slid to spread to a uniform film thickness applied coating material and thereby remove excess coating material, in a state where the third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is placed adjacent to the wing parts W of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As aforementioned above, the third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> has the same construction as the second nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, except that the lower ends of the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> thereof are formed to conform to a surface outline of the wing parts W and the single guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is positioned between the pair of coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to be brought into sliding contact with the bridge part B of the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>, a coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for coating a half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprising a pair of unseparated pistons, which is prepared in the course of manufacturing the piston P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor prior to being cut into two pistons, is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, head parts H are respectively formed at both ends of the half-finished product, and the two pairs of wing parts W are formed between the head parts H, with the two pairs joined to each other. In consideration of these facts, the coating apparatus according to the this sixth embodiment is constructed in the same manner as the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the previous fifth embodiment, except that one head part H is coated by the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the other head part H is coated by a third coating material applying means <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> which has the same construction as the first coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the wing parts W are coated by the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, further detailed description for the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be omitted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, a method for coating the head parts H and the wing parts B through a series of continuous processes by the coating apparatus C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constructed as mentioned above will be synthetically described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> First, both ends, that is, head surfaces of both head parts H of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are rotatably supported by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Then, the first and third coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are lowered so that the coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of their respective first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are placed with a predetermined gap adjacent to the head parts H of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supported by the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In this state, while the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated, coating material is injected to the head parts H of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the first and third coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. And, the coating material applied to the head parts H of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is spread to a uniform film thickness, and thereby excess coating material is removed by the respective coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the first nozzles <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. If coating of the head parts H is completed, the first and third coating material applying means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are raised. Thereafter, the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the coated head parts H is conveyed from the rotation support means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> by the conveying means, and both ends of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Next, the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is lowered so that the guide post <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the bridge part B of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fixedly supported by the fixing means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and respective coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the third nozzle <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are placed adjacent to the two pairs of wing parts W of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this state, coating material is injected to the wing parts W of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> while the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is slid in an axial direction of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. And, coating material applied to the wing parts W of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is spread to a uniform film thickness, and thereby excess coating material is removed, by the respective coating material spreading means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the third nozzle <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Then, the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is raised, and the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having the coated wing parts W is unloaded by unloading means. By cutting the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> along a line where the two pairs of wing parts W are joined with each other, two pistons P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the above-described procedure for coating the head parts H and wing parts W of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a viscosity of coating material, a rotational velocity of the half-finished product P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a sliding speed of the second coating material applying means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are set in the same manner as the fifth embodiment of the present invention, and therefore, detailed description therefor will be omitted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides advantages in that, since coating material spreading means for spreading coating material upon application thereof is formed integrally with a nozzle for injecting coating material, a separate blade and means for driving and controlling the separate blade, as in the conventional art, are not needed. Therefore, due to elimination of the separate blade and its driving and controlling means, constructional simplification and miniaturization of the entire coating apparatus are accomplished, and control can be implemented in an easy manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present invention, upon coating a piston, because it is possible to coat a head part(s) and a bridge part or wing parts through a series of continuous processes in the same coating apparatus, productivity and quality of an end product are improved. Furthermore, by the fact that a dispenser method is employed instead of an air spraying method, waste of coating material due to spatter and pollution of surrounding devices are effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by the film coating nozzle and the coating apparatus using the same according to the present invention, since it is possible to coat, through a series of continuous processes, a piston for a fixed displacement swash plate type compressor, a piston for a variable displacement swash plate type compressor, or a half-finished product comprising a pair of unseparated pistons which is prepared in the course of manufacturing the piston for the variable displacement swash plate type compressor, universal compatibility of a compressor piston coating apparatus is improved, and an equipment cost can be saved. </paragraph>
