<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the testing of electronic integrated circuits, and more particularly the invention relates to sockets for receiving packaged integrated circuits for test purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The packaged integrated circuit typically includes a polymer or ceramic housing for a semiconductor chip with electrical leads extending from the package which are electrically connected to the semiconductor chip. In a dual in-line package (DIP), the electrical leads are arranged in two parallel rows with the leads depending from the bottom of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Packaged integrated circuits must undergo a number of different tests, each test requiring the insertion of the integrated circuit package and leads into a test socket. To prevent bending or damage to the leads, zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets have been devised to limit the force exerted on the leads when the package is inserted into a test socket. The most widely known and used ZIF sockets are from 3M Corporation and Aries Corporation. In these sockets the leads of a DIP (dual in-line package) are pinched between two pieces of metal which are, in turn, soldered to a printed circuit board. The metal pieces are held in place by the body of the ZIF socket which is typically made of plastic. The metal pieces are electrically conducting to provide a good electrical path from the DIP lead to the printed circuit board in which the ZIF socket is attached. In all cases, the bodies of these sockets are made of some organic material (plastics or polymers) which can only withstand temperatures as high as 250 degree C. for extended periods of time. The metal used to pinch the leads of the IC DIP packages are beryllium copper alloy or beryllium nickel alloy for a high temperature operation not to exceed 250 degree C. While these sockets perform well within their stated specifications, they cannot be used at temperatures in excess of 250 degree C. because the materials will decompose and fail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,179,640, assigned to the present assignee, discloses a test socket including two members having planar surfaces arranged to permit relative lateral movement between the two members. One member is a package support and has a plurality of holes extending therethrough for receiving the integrated circuit package leads. Each hole has sufficient size to receive a lead with minimal or no force. The second member is a contact support and has a plurality of contact wires arranged to be in spaced juxtaposition with package leads when a package is inserted into or removed from the support member. The contacts are slidable into engagement with the package leads after the package is inserted. </paragraph>

Vertical separation of the rows of holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be 0.3 inch to accommodate an industry standard I.C. package called &ldquo;narrow DIP&rdquo;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows package support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> slid relative to contact support <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whereby wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are moved from holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and permit the insertion of leads of an integrated circuit package into holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> represent the same ZIF socket of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but now engaged by leads or pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of UUT <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For clarity, the main body of UUT <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been removed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> to expose the underlying interaction between pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and spring wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the socket holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are not located midway between the anchor points of the wires, but rather the length of the wire sections that lie underneath the body of the UUT are significantly shorter than the wire sections that lie outside of the UUT <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This causes the shorter inner wire sections to distort more than the longer outer sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order for the spring wire contacts to perform well, a certain amount of reasonable &ldquo;working distance&rdquo; must be provided between the anchor points and the contact points. If the working distance is too small, damage to either the UUT pins or the spring wires can result. Experience shows that the smaller the working distance, the more difficult the overall design of the ZIF mechanism, especially in terms of allowing tolerances of the socket components. Consequently, a low working distance can have significant adverse ramifications in terms of both cost and reliability of the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to increasing the working distance in such a ZIF socket. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, wire contacts in a contact support plate of a ZIF test socket are arranged in two parallel partially interdigitated sets to thereby increase the minimum working distance between contact points on the wire and anchor points at either end of the wire. The wires are inclined with respect to the alignment of lead receiving holes in the package support plate to allow for the interdigitation of the sets of wires. Thus the working distance of the wire under the DIP package is not limited to less than half the width of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention and objects and features thereof will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description and dependent claims when taken with the drawing.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, 1B</cross-reference> are plan views of a ZIF socket <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in accordance with the prior art having two sets of wire contacts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on contact support plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with each wire extending over a contact hole, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of package support plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and with ends of <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the wires being anchored to plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To facilitate viewing of the contact wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, top plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for supporting a unit under test is shown transparent. Each of the holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is larger than a lead of the UUT, thus facilitating minimal or zero insertion force. When inserting a UUT and leads into the socket, wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are moved relative to holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> whereby holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are unimpeded by wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in receiving UUT leads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> are plan views illustrating the flexing of wire contacts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when engaging leads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extending from a UUT body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mounted on movable support plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Again, for illustration purposes, UUT body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is removed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> to illustrate wire contacts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> engaging leads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with the wires being flexed in pressure engagement with the leads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As described above, it will be noted that the socket holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are not located halfway between anchor points <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> but rather the length of the wire sections that lie underneath the body of the UUT are significantly shorter than the wire sections which lie outside the UUT outline. This causes the shorter inner wire sections to distort more as compared to the longer outer wire sections when receiving the UUT. In order for the spring wire contacts to perform well, a certain amount of working distance between the contact and anchor points is required. If the working distance is too small, then damage can result to either the UUT pins or the spring wires. Further, a smaller working distance makes the overall design of the ZIF mechanism more difficult, especially in terms of allowed tolerances of socket components. Consequently, a short working distance can have significant ramifications in terms of both cost and reliability of the test socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, the working distance of the inner wire segments is increased by arranging the sets of wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a partially interdigitated arrangement, thereby increasing the working distance from a lead contact point on each wire to an anchor point on the inner interdigitated portion of each wire. Again, it will be noted that each wire cooperates with a hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to make contact with a UUT lead. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows an empty position with wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> centrally disposed under the holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are in flexed engagement with UUT leads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extending through holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the socket plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In contrast with the prior art socket where wires in the two wire sets are in alignment, the socket in accordance with the invention places the wires at an angle so that the two sets can be at least partially interdigitated to increase the length of the wire sections that lie underneath the body of a UUT. Thus the inner lengths of the wires are not limited to less than half the width of a DIP package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to a specific embodiment, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be considered as limiting the invention. Various modifications and applications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
