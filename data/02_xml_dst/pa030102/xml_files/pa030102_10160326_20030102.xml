<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a current breaker circuit for cutting off a plurality of storage devices connected in series, and load circuits (voltage detection circuit) for the respective storage devices in accordance with a single external signal so that a leakage current can be prevented; to a voltage detection circuit for such storage devices; and an abnormality detection circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a circuit in which a plurality of storage devices are connected in series and loads are connected to the storage devices respectively, it has been heretofore necessary to prevent consumption of energy accumulated in the storage devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To this end, there have been related-art current breaker circuits as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. Such current breaker circuits can disconnect all the loads in accordance with a single control signal when the storage devices and the loads are disconnected respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The configurations and operations of the related-art circuits will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of a related-art current breaker circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected in series. In addition, loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to the storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition, semiconductor switching devices Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected between the storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The bases of the semiconductor switching devices Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which are control terminals are connected in common through diodes d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to d<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and resistors r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to r<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that an external signal switch S provided between the common connection terminal and the negative terminal of the storage device B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be turned ON or OFF in accordance with an ON/OFF signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As for the operation of this current breaker circuit, when the external signal switch S provided between the common connection terminal of the resistors r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to r<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the negative terminal of the storage device B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned ON in accordance with the ON/OFF signal supplied to the switch S, all the semiconductor switching devices Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned ON. Thus, currents are supplied from the storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> corresponding and respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, when the external signal switch S is turned OFF, the semiconductor switching devices Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned OFF so that no current is supplied to the loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this current breaker circuit, all the semiconductor switching devices Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be turned ON/OFF in accordance with a single ON/OFF signal. However, on the higher potential side (the storage device B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) of the storage devices connected in series, the voltage between the emitter of the semiconductor switching device and the negative terminal of the storage device B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases. Thus, there is a problem that the power loss of the resistor increases and a high voltage switch has to be used as the external signal switch S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows another example of a related-art current breaker circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected in series in the same manner as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition, loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to the storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, photo-couplers (photo-relays) PH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to PH<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected between the storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> All of light-emitting diodes of the photo-couplers PH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to PH<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected in series, and designed so that a current is supplied between opposite terminals of each light-emitting diode in accordance with an ON/OFF signal given to the switch S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As for the operation of this current breaker circuit, all the photo-couplers PH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to PH<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned ON when a current is supplied to the light-emitting diodes connected in series. Thus, currents are supplied from the storage devices B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, when no current is supplied to the light-emitting diodes connected in series, all the photo-couplers PH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to PH<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned OFF. Thus, no current is supplied to the loads R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In this current breaker circuit, all the semiconductor switching devices Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be turned ON/OFF in accordance with a single ON/OFF signal. Accordingly, the problem of withstanding voltage as in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is solved. On the other hand, there is however a problem that a large number of expensive photo-couplers or the like have to be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the control signal generating unit supplies the ON/OFF signal to at least two adjacent ones of the semiconductor switching devices simultaneously, the number of the control signal generator circuits can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the semiconductor switching device supplied with the external control signal is formed as a semiconductor switching device connected to a lower voltage side among the storage devices connected in series, the potential of the switch can be made lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the ON/OFF signal is supplied to the semiconductor switching devices through diodes respectively, high voltage can be prevented from being applied to the control terminals of the semiconductor switching devices. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the invention, an abnormality detection circuit for detecting abnormality of a current breaker circuit breaking currents in accordance with a single external control signal is provided. The currents flow into a plurality of loads which are respectively connected between terminals of a plurality of storage devices connected in series. When operation abnormality of the current breaker circuit is detected on the basis of the single external control signal and a terminal-to-terminal voltage of a final-stage one of the loads in the abnormality detection circuit, abnormality of the operation of the current breaker circuit as a whole can be detected easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition, a first photo-coupler and a second photo-coupler may be provided and connected in series to opposite terminals of the final-stage load respectively. In this case, the external control signal is supplied to the second photo-coupler only for an abnormality detection period so as to turn on the abnormality detection circuit and thereby obtain a detection result through the first photo-coupler. Thus, a current is allowed to flow into a light emitting device of the first photo-coupler and a light receiving device of the second photo-coupler only for the detection period. Accordingly, it is not necessary to make a constant conduction. It is therefore possible to prevent useless consumption of electric power.</paragraph>
