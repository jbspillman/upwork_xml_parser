<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electromechanical functional parts using surface acoustic waves (SAW), of which wave acoustic velocity is several kilometers per second and which have characteristics such that wave energy is concentrated on the surface of a propagation medium, have received attention with the general trend toward densification of hardware, and gone into actual use in delay lines for radars and band-pass filters for television image receptors in association with development of inter digital transducer electrodes (IDT electrodes) and progress in thin film formation technology and surface treatment technology, and are now widely used as RF and IF stage filters for transmit-receive circuits of communication apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, balance characteristics of semiconductor parts such as IC has been promoted for the purpose of improving antinoise characteristics, and balance characteristics is also required in surface acoustic wave filters for use in the RF stage. Also, in recent years, it has been required that the surface acoustic wave filter should have unbalanced-balanced type terminals or balanced-balanced type terminals, due to IC placed in the pre-stage and post-stage of the surface acoustic wave filter, and the like. In addition, longitudinal mode type surface acoustic wave filters have been widely used as filters of RF stage. For such surface acoustic wave filters, the balance characteristics is one of important parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (A) The conventional longitudinal mode type surface acoustic wave filter having an unbalanced-balanced type input/output terminal will be first described referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> By inputting a signal to the unbalanced type terminal IN, an surface acoustic wave is produced in the first TDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the conventional longitudinal mode type surface acoustic wave filter having a balanced type terminal is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, the surface acoustic wave filter has a configuration similar to that of the aforementioned conventional surface acoustic wave filter (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), and comprises first, second and third interdigital transducer electrodes <highlight><bold>4102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4104</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as IDT electrode), and first and second reflector electrodes <highlight><bold>4105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4106</bold></highlight> on a piezoelectric substrate <highlight><bold>4101</bold></highlight>. One electrode finger of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>4102</bold></highlight> is connected to one of balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>4107</bold></highlight>, and the other electrode finger of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>4102</bold></highlight> is connected to the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4108</bold></highlight>. Also, the electrode fingers of the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>4103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4104</bold></highlight> located on one side are connected to an unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4109</bold></highlight>, and the electrode fingers located on the other side are grounded. The above configuration makes it possible to obtain the surface acoustic wave filter having unbalanced-balanced type terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, the above described conventional surface acoustic wave filter has the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> (A) For the surface acoustic wave filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there exist near the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> a wiring connecting the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight>, and a wiring connecting the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is located at a greater distance from the wiring connecting the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode connecting the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight>, than leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> has a larger parasitic component of high frequency existing between itself and the leading electrode connecting the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight> to the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> and the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, than the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. Thus, balance characteristics will be degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For the surface acoustic wave filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> leading electrode connecting the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and a leading electrode connecting the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> exist near the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, and signals substantially identical in phase are passed through these two leading electrodes. Therefore, the parasitic component of high frequency between the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode from the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> is substantially identical in phase to the parasitic component of high frequency between the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode from the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a leading electrode connecting the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and a leading electrode connecting the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> exist near the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> to the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, and signals substantially identical in phase are passed through these two leading electrodes.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the signals outputted from the balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> or the balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> contain the above described parasitic components, and an unbalanced parasitic component is generated in each of the balanced type terminals, thus compromising the characteristic of the surface acoustic wave filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this way, for the conventional surface acoustic wave filter (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>), there are cases where leading electrodes from IDT electrodes and each IDT electrodes are spatially coupling to each other to degrade balance characteristics and compromise the characteristic of the surface acoustic wave filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> (B) Also, for the surface acoustic wave filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> leading electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connecting the lower electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fifth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a leading electrode <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> connecting the lower electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sixth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> exist near the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, neither leading electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> nor leading electrode <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> exists near the leas wiring connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this way, the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is located at a closer distance from the leading electrodes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> than the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the lower electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The inventor therefore believes that unbalanced parasitic components exist in the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the lower electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, thus degrading the balance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In this way, for the conventional surface acoustic wave filter (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>), there are cases where leading electrodes from IDT electrodes and each IDT electrodes are spatially coupling to each other to make the parasitic component unbalanced, whereby the balance characteristics is degraded and the characteristic of the surface acoustic wave filter is compromised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> (C) Also, the surface acoustic wave filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> suffers significant degradation in amplitude balance characteristic and phase balance characteristic in the passband with the value of amplitude balance characteristic being &minus;1.2 dB to &plus;1.0 dB and the value of phase balance characteristic being &minus;8&deg; to &plus;10&deg; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>C. Furthermore, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</cross-reference> shows the pass characteristic of the conventional 900 MHz band surface acoustic wave filter, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</cross-reference> shows the amplitude balance characteristic in the passband (from 925 MHz to 960 MHz) of the conventional 900 MHz band surface acoustic wave filter, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</cross-reference> shows the phase balance characteristic in the passband of the conventional 900 MHz band surface acoustic wave filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Here, the amplitude balance characteristic means a difference between the signal amplitude between one of the balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>4107</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4109</bold></highlight> and the signal amplitude between the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4108</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4109</bold></highlight>, and if this value equals 0, the balance characteristic is never degraded. Also, the phase balance characteristic means a deviation from 180&deg; of a difference between the phase of a signal between one of the balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>4107</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4109</bold></highlight> and the phase of a signal between the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4108</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>4109</bold></highlight>, and if this value equals 0, the balance characteristic is never degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In this way, the conventional surface acoustic wave filter (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>) suffers degradation of the balance characteristic, one of important electric characteristics.

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> An surface acoustic wave filter of Embodiment 1 of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings. Furthermore, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of the surface acoustic wave filter in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> corresponds to the first IDT electrode of the present invention, a second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> corresponds to the second IDT electrode of the present invention, and a third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> corresponds to the third IDT electrode of the present invention. Also, a first reflector electrode <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> corresponds to the first reflector electrode of the present invention, and a second reflector electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> corresponds to the second reflector electrode of the present invention. Also, one of balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> corresponds to the one of the first balanced type terminals of the present invention, the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> corresponds to the other of first balanced type terminals of the present invention, and an unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> corresponds to the unbalanced type terminal of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> denotes a piezoelectric substrate, and the surface acoustic wave can be excited by forming on this piezo electric substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> electrode patterns crossing in such a manner as to create periodic structured strip lines. A longitudinal mode type surface acoustic wave filter comprising the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the first and second reflector electrodes <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed on the piezoelectric substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In the above surface acoustic wave filter, an upper electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to one of the balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and a lower electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Also, an upper electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is connected to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and a lower electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is grounded. A lower electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and an upper electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In this way, the above surface acoustic wave filter is configured to have unbalanced-balanced type terminals and the signal path from the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is connected upside down from a structural viewpoint. Also, the upper electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> have same numbers of electrode fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The above configuration makes it possible to prevent degradation of balance characteristics caused by the unbalanced spatial bonding between leading electrodes from the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> both connected to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and a leading electrode from the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> connected to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to obtain an surface acoustic wave filter having satisfactory balance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> That is, the signal path from the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is connected upside down from a structural viewpoint, whereby the spatial bonding between the leading electrodes from the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode from the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> connected to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is substantially identical to the spatial bonding between the leading electrodes from the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode from the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> connected to the balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Thus, degradation of balance characteristics can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Also, the arrangement of electrode fingers in the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is such that surface acoustic waves do not balance each other out. That is, given that the upper electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> both connected to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are positive (&plus;), and the electrodes grounded are negative (&minus;), an in-phase arrangement is provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> does not influence the effect of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows the configuration in which the upper electrode of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are shifted by one electrode finger, respectively. In this case, only the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has just an opposite polarity, and thus the effect by the embodiment of the present invention is unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Also, the upper electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are connected to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, but instead thereof, the lower electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the upper electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be connected to the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. That is, if the signal paths are connected to the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> upside down from a structural viewpoint, an effect similar to that of the embodiment of the present invention can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The surface acoustic wave filter of Embodiment 2 of the present invention will now be described referring to the drawings.

Furthermore, the leading electrodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be drawn on the underlying substrate of the piezoelectric substrate instead of drawing the leading electrodes on the piezoelectric substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, connections to the terminals IN, OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided in such a manner as to lead to terminals outside the piezoelectric substrate by wire bonding implementation, face down implementation or the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Operations of this surface acoustic wave filter of this embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> By inputting a signal to the unbalanced type terminal IN, an surface acoustic wave is produced in the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the surface acoustic wave produces a plurality of resonance modes by the first and second reflector electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. By using these resonance modes, filter characteristics can be obtained, and conversions into electrical signals are carried out in the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> The electrical signal converted in the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is outputted to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fifth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>.

At this time, by adjusting in advance the intervals between the IDT electrodes of the surface acoustic wave filter and the way of connecting electrode fingers, the phase of the electrical signal inputted to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made opposite to that of the electrical signal inputted to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Then, the surface acoustic waves converted in the fifth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the sixth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are propagated through the piezoelectric substrate. The propagated surface acoustic waves are reflected at the third and fourth reflector electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby producing a plurality of resonance modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> By using these resonance modes, filter characteristics can be obtained, and the waves are outputted from the balanced type terminals OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> First, for the conventional surface acoustic wave filter, it has been predicted that because the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is close to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> parasitic capacitance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is generated by these leading electrodes.

<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> As a result of carrying out simulation under these simulation conditions, the filter characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> have been obtained for the conventional surface acoustic wave filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> The filter characteristic of the conventional surface acoustic wave filter determined by simulation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. Also, the amplitude balance of the conventional surface acoustic wave filter determined by simulation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference>.

Therefore, as the magnitude of phase balance increases, the deviation from the ideal state becomes larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Then, for the surface acoustic wave filter of this embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, it has been predicted that because the leading electrode connecting the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is close to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> parasitic capacitance <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is generated by these leading electrodes.

<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> In this way, as a result of determining by simulation the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave filter of this embodiment and the characteristics of the conventional surface acoustic wave filter, it has been found that the surface acoustic wave filter of this embodiment has better balance characteristics and has a better filter characteristic than the conventional surface acoustic wave filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> This result may be interpreted as follows.

<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> In addition, the improved characteristics of the surface acoustic wave filter of this embodiment can also be attributed to the fact that the phase of the signal inputted to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mutually opposite to the phase of the signal inputted to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> In this way, the influence by the parasitic component produced with the leading electrode from the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be substantially equalized with the influence by the parasitic component produced with the leading electrode from the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by turning upside down the connection between the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the fifth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with respect to the connection between the leading electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the sixth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and therefore degradation of balance characteristics can be prevented, thus making it possible to achieve an surface acoustic wave filter having good characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the electrode fingers in each IDT electrode are arranged so that surface acoustic waves do not balance each other out.

<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the IDT electrodes are arranged in advance so that the phase of the signal inputted to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is opposite to the phase of the signal inputted to the leading electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as in the case of the aforementioned Embodiment 7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned Embodiment 7, the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is lead from the upper electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and therefore the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located in close vicinity to the leading electrode connecting the unbalanced type terminal IN to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, in consideration of bonding between these leading electrodes, the leading electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are preferably lead from the lower electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> Operations of this embodiment will now be described focusing on points of difference between this embodiment and the aforementioned Embodiment 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> Provided that the number of electrode fingers is fixed, the number of widths of arms is fixed, and the central pitch between adjacent electrode fingers is fixed in the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the impedances of the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the balanced type terminal OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are higher when the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is divided into the first segmented IDT electrode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the second segmented IDT electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the third segmented IDT electrode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> than when the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not divided.

<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by dividing the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, an surface acoustic wave filter with increased impedances of the balanced type terminals OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be achieved without changing the filter characteristics by dividing the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> In addition, by adjusting the ratios of the number of electrode fingers of the second segmented IDT electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the numbers of electrode fingers of the first and third segmented IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the impedances of the balanced type terminals OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> In this way, by dividing the fourth IDT electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the impedance can be controlled. </paragraph>

In this case, the influence of the parasitic component between the leading electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the leading electrode connecting the unbalanced type terminal IN to the upper electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in Embodiments 7 to 10, the fourth segmented IDT electrode is divided into segmented IDT electrodes, but this is not a limiting case, and all or some of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth IDT electrodes may be divided into segmented IDT electrodes. If the first IDT electrode is divided into segmented IDT electrodes, an surface acoustic wave filter in which the impedance of the unbalanced type terminal IN is increased can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> Also, in Embodiments 7 to 10, the number of segmented IDT electrodes into which the IDT electrode is divided is 2 or 3, but the IDT electrode may be divided into four or more of segmented IDT electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Also, in Embodiments 7 to 10, the unbalanced type electrode IN is located on the side of the upper electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: namely it is located on the side opposite to the second-stage filter track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the first-stage filter track <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the upper electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the unbalanced type terminal IN, but this is not a limiting case. The configuration is also possible in which the unbalanced type terminal IN is located on the side of the lower electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: namely it is located on the side of the second-stage filter track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the first-stage filter-track <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the unbalanced type terminal IN.

<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> Also, in Embodiments 7 to 10, the upper electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the unbalanced type terminal IN, but this is not a limiting case. For these surface acoustic wave filters, the upper electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be connected to one and the other balanced type terminal of a pair of terminals different from the pair of balanced type terminals OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this case, a balanced-balanced type surface acoustic wave filter is obtained. Then, the parasitic component between the leading electrode lead from one of the different pair of balanced type terminals and the leading electrode connecting the first-stage filter track <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the second-stage filter track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is equivalent to the parasitic component between the leading electrode lead from the other balanced type terminal of the different pair of balanced type terminals and the leading electrode connecting the first-stage filter track <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the second-stage filter track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and therefore a similar effect can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> Also, in Embodiments 7 to 10, the second-stage filter track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located below the first-stage filter track <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, but this is not a limiting case, and the second-stage filter track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be located above the first-stage filter track <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> without changing connections by leading electrode between the IDT electrodes and the unbalanced type terminal IN and a pair of balanced type terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Also, in Embodiments 7 to 10, the electrode with no leading electrode connected thereto, of the upper electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is grounded, and the electrode with no leading electrode connected thereto, of the upper electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is grounded, but this is not a limiting case. If the phase of the signal passing through the leading electrode connected to the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is opposite to the phase of the signal passing through the leading electrode connected to the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, these electrodes may be electrically connected instead of grounding them. </paragraph>

Also, a reactance element <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight> corresponds to the reactance element of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> Before the configuration of the surface acoustic wave filter (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>) is described, discussions will be made on what cause degradation of the balance characteristic of the surface acoustic wave filter. For the surface acoustic wave filter requiring characteristics covering a wide band, which is used in the RF stage, piezoelectric substrates made of tantalum lithiumate (LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and niobium lithiumate (LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) are generally used, and the effective dielectric constants of these plates are large with their values equal to about 48 and 49, respectively. Here, using relative dielectric constant tensors &egr;<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>T </superscript></highlight>and &egr;<highlight><subscript>33</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>, the effective relative dielectric constant is defined by the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Formula 1&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>((&egr;<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>)&times;(&egr;<highlight><subscript>33</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>))<highlight><superscript>{fraction (<highlight><bold>1/2</bold></highlight>)}</superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave filter, because of the large effective dielectric constant of the piezoelectric substrate, not only spatial bonding between IDT electrodes but also bonding due to parasitic components between IDT electrodes in the piezoelectric substrate occurs, and in addition thereto, parasitic components are generated in wirings required for connecting IDT electrodes to terminals, and the like. Hitherto, improvements of balance characteristics by reducing unbalanced parasitic components between wirings have been described in various ways, and a configuration in contemplation of these parasitic components is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. The configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> has a capacitance component <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> provided between IDT electrodes as a parasitic component for the surface acoustic wave filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. The results of carrying out analyses for filters in the 900 MHz band with the capacitance value of the capacitance component <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> being changed in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used as a piezoelectric substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference> show the maximum and minimum values of the amplitude and phase balance characteristics in the passband, respectively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference>, the balance characteristic becomes poorer as the capacitance value increases. That is, it has been demonstrated that as the bonding between IDT electrodes by the parasitic component is strengthened, the balance characteristic of the surface acoustic wave filter becomes poorer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the surface acoustic wave filter allowing the aforementioned degradation in balance characteristic to be improved will now be described. The configuration of the longitudinal mode type surface acoustic wave filter having balanced type terminals according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the surface acoustic wave filter comprises first, second and third interdigital transducer electrodes <highlight><bold>3102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as IDT electrodes), and first and second reflector electrodes <highlight><bold>3105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3106</bold></highlight> on a piezoelectric substrate <highlight><bold>3101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> One electrode finger of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3102</bold></highlight> is connected to one of balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>3107</bold></highlight>, and the other electrode finger of the first IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3102</bold></highlight> is connected to the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>3108</bold></highlight>. Also, the electrode fingers of the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>3103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight> on one side are connected to an unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>3109</bold></highlight>, and the electrode fingers on the other side are grounded. In addition, the first IDT electrode is connected to the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>3103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight> with a reactance element <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight> therebetween. In this case, the reactance element is located between one of balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>3107</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>3109</bold></highlight>. The above configuration makes it possible to obtain an surface acoustic wave filter having unbalanced-balanced type terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is the characteristic of the surface acoustic wave filter in which an inductor is placed as a reactance element. LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used as a piezoelectric substrate. In addition, the surface acoustic wave filter is set so that the resonance frequency of the parallel resonance formed by parasitic components such as bonding between IDT electrodes and spatial bonding, and the placed inductance falls within the passband. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference> shows a pass characteristic, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference> shows an amplitude balance characteristic in the passband, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31C</cross-reference> shows a phase balance characteristic in the passband. As apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, the amplitude balance characteristic is &minus;0.2 dB to &plus;0.2 dB, and the phase balance characteristic is &minus;4&deg; to &plus;1&deg; in the passband, and thus the balance characteristics are improved without degrading the pass characteristic, compared to the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in Embodiment 11, the reactance element is placed between one of balanced type terminals <highlight><bold>3107</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>3109</bold></highlight>, as a reactance element between the first IDT electrode and the second and third IDT electrodes <highlight><bold>3103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight>, but instead thereof, the reactance element may be placed between the other balanced type terminal <highlight><bold>3108</bold></highlight> and the unbalanced type terminal <highlight><bold>3109</bold></highlight>. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, even if a first reactance element <highlight><bold>3301</bold></highlight> is placed between the first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3103</bold></highlight>, and a second reactance element <highlight><bold>3302</bold></highlight> is placed between the first IDT electrode and the third IDT electrode <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight>, the effect of improving the balance characteristics can be similarly achieved, as long as parasitic components such as bonding between IDT electrodes and spatial bonding form the parallel resonance with the reactance element, and makes its resonance frequency fall within the passband. Furthermore, the first reactance element <highlight><bold>3301</bold></highlight> and the second reactance element <highlight><bold>3302</bold></highlight> each correspond to the reactance element of the present invention. </paragraph>

This configuration is different from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> in that the electrode finger of the third IDT electrode connected to the unbalanced type terminal is turned upside down.

<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> Also, Embodiments 11 to 13 have been described using an inductance as a reactance element, but this is not a limiting case, and a transmission line and the like may be used in combination, namely a similar improvement effect can be achieved by setting a configuration such that capacitance components produced between terminals balance each other out in the passband.
