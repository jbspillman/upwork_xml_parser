<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a high pressure gas cycle for use in an engine. The invention also relates to an electrical power generating plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The Otto cycle shown diagrammatically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> &lsqb;Prior Art&rsqb;, with pressure as the ordinate and volume as the abscissa, is a cycle that closely represents the explosion and compression stages of a gasoline automobile engine. In the Otto cycle, the air is drawn in at atmospheric pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then compressed isentropically to a high pressure with fuel mixed in the air, shown at <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The fuel air mixture explodes at a theoretically constant volume to form a combustion gas having an increased pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The combustion gas expands isentropically back to the original inlet volume, shown at <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, where the combustion gas is then discharged. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the combustion gas discharges at a pressure above atmosphere, shown at <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and then the pressure drops to atmosphere as it exhausts from the engine, not shown. The energy that could be available by expanding from exhaust pressure to atmospheric pressure, represented by the difference between <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The theoretical efficiency of the Otto Cycle is defined by the relationship 1&minus;(V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>(K&minus;1) </superscript></highlight>where V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the ratio of the volume before compression to the volume after compression, commonly called the compression ratio. K&equals;ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume&equals;C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another cycle commonly used in automobile engines is the Diesel cycle. The pressure vs. volume diagram for a Diesel cycle is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> &lsqb;Prior Art&rsqb;. In a Diesel cycle, air is drawn in at atmospheric pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and then the air is compressed, shown at <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The fuel is injected after the air is compressed and burns at somewhere near constant pressure to form a combustion gas, shown at <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The combustion gas expands isentropically back to the original inlet volume, shown at <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, where the combustion gas is then discharged. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the combustion gas discharges at a pressure above atmosphere, shown at <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and then the pressure drops to atmosphere as it exhausts from the engine, not shown. The energy that could be available by expanding from exhaust pressure to atmospheric pressure, represented by the difference between <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, is wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The advantage of the Diesel cycle compared to the Otto cycle is that the compression ratio can be made much higher than that for the Otto Cycle, because the fuel is not mixed in the air, and therefore the rise during compression in temperature will not ignite the fuel until after the fuel is injected at the high pressure. In general, this increase in compression ratio for the Diesel Cycle enables the Diesel cycle to achieve higher efficiencies than are possible with the Otto Cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The compression ratio for the Otto Cycle is usually limited to about 10 to 1, corresponding to a pressure ratio of about 25 to 1. The reason for this is that at higher ratios the fuel air mixture becomes so hot that the explosion occurs before the mixture is fully compressed. This preignition or detonation actually decreases the power output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the Diesel engine the fuel injection occurs after compression, and only air is being compressed during the compression cycle. Therefore, typical compression ratios are 23 to 1, corresponding to pressure ratios of 82 to 1. This is the basic reason why the Diesel cycle is more efficient than the Otto cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further cycle is the Brayton or Joule cycle, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> &lsqb;Prior Art&rsqb;. In the Brayton cycle, air is drawn into a compressor at atmospheric pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and then compressed to a high pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Fuel is injected into the compressed air in the combustor, where it burns at nearly a constant pressure (except for friction losses in the combustor) to form a combustion gas, shown at <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The combustion gas expands isentropically back to atmospheric pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the expansion to atmospheric pressure is advantageous, and the theoretical efficiency is like the Otto cycle above in that the theoretical efficiency is equal to 1&minus;(V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>(K-1) </superscript></highlight>where V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is again the volume ratio of specific volume at atmospheric pressure divided by the specific volume at the pressure at which burning starts. The Brayton cycle is the cycle commonly used in gas turbines, and is limited in efficiency by the fact that the temperature of the gas entering the turbine is nearly the same as the combustion temperature. Therefore the combustion temperatures possible in a gas turbine system are usually limited to approximately 2300 to 2600&deg; F. However, the Brayton cycle does have an advantage over the Otto cycle in that complete expansion back to essentially atmosphere is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage of the Brayton cycle is that as pressure ratios or compression ratios are increased the temperature leaving the compressor and entering the combustor becomes higher. Therefore, less fuel energy can be added because of the temperature limit of the turbine. For this reason, although efficiency can be increased by increasing the pressure ratio in a gas turbine cycle, the output gradually decreases as higher pressure ratios are used. Therefore, it is common practice to limit the pressure ratio in industrial gas turbines to about 10 to 20 atmospheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows typical theoretical performance calculations for the Brayton cycle, based on air standard data and constant mass flow through the cycle.

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An almost complete expansion cycle was made by Sargent, in which the air inlet to the engine is throttled to take in less air volume and thereby allow for an increase in volume in the exhaust. However, this Sargent cycle was not a success in a reciprocating engine because of the high mechanical friction losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a complete expansion cycle that is suitable for use in a reciprocating engine, which substantially avoids wasting energy due to exhaust pressures that are greater than atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There is also a need for an improved combustion chamber that is capable of supplying compressed gas to a turbine blade at temperatures significantly below the combustion temperature of the fuel being burned. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Electrical power plants utilizing turbine engines to drive electrical generators produce large amounts of combustion gasses which contain carbon dioxide and byproducts such as nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, the exhaust gas from conventional turbine engines usually has a temperature of about 700&deg; F. to about 1240&deg; F. Typically a Rankine cycle system is used to recovery valuable energy from the exhaust gas. However, efficient low temperature vapor turbines usually cannot be used because the exhaust temperature from a conventional turbine engine is too high. Exhaust temperatures from conventional turbine engines usually require the use of an expensive steam turbine to recover the energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for an electrical generating power plant comprising more efficient turbines to reduce the quantity of combustion gasses produced, and for turbine engines having exhaust temperature suitable for use in driving low temperature vapor turbines. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be further explained with reference to the attached drawings. The present invention provides a combustion chamber for producing a pressurized gas, which has significantly reduced friction losses. Furthermore, the pressurized gas introduced into the combustion chamber can be provided at a temperature which is significantly lower than the combustion temperature of the fuel being burned in the combustion chamber. Moreover, the combustion chamber utilizes detonation of a combustible gas to provide improved burning efficiency and reduced byproducts such as nitrogen oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The improved combustion chamber according to the present invention will be explained with reference to a turbine engine. However, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that the pressurized gas produced by the combustion chamber can be converted to mechanical energy using other means besides a turbine blade. For example, the pressurized gas can be used to drive a reciprocating piston. The pressurized gas could also be used for jet propulsion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The present invention demonstrates that unexpectedly it is possible to attain the advantages of an explosion cycle at high pressures, and also to achieve substantially complete expansion of the exhaust, thereby greatly improving the cycle efficiency of an engine. A combustion chamber can be provided that is capable of supplying pressurized gas to a turbine blade at temperatures significantly below the combustion temperature of the fuel being burned. By producing a pressurized gas having a temperature below combustion temperatures, the following advantages can be attained: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> (1) significantly greater pressure ratios can be utilized in the turbine while not exceeding the temperature limits of the turbine blades; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (2) greater amounts of fuel can be burned while not exceeding the temperature limits of the turbine blades; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> (3) net power output of the turbine can be greatly increased; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> (4) at the higher pressure ratios achieved by the combustion chamber according to the present invention, specific volumes are lower, thereby permitting shorter turbine blades, that are stronger and easier to cool compared with longer turbine blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of the high pressure cycle according to the present invention which is used in a turbine engine. On the left end of the shaft shown at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is the last stage of a series of axial flow compressor blades, the last blade being shown at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Air is compressed by the compressor blades and discharged from the compressor, shown at <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. After leaving the air compressor, the compressed air enters a chamber which is divided into two sections by a divider plate, shown at <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In an upper section, shown generally at <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, fuel is introduced into the chamber through a fuel inlet, shown at <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and mixes with the air. In the lower section, shown generally at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the air remains substantially free-of fuel. The air/fuel mixture is discharged through the inlet of a valve, shown at <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, into a combustion chamber. The combustion chamber, shown at <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, comprises an explosion chamber, shown generally at <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and a compression chamber, shown generally at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Any valve that is suitable for controlling the flow of a compressed gas into the combustion chamber can be utilized. Preferably, the valve is capable of synchronizing the flow of gas into the combustion chamber with a resonating pressure wave therein, whereby the valve is open when the combustion chamber pressure is lower than average and closed when the combustion chamber pressure is greater than average. A non-limiting preferred example of a valve is a distributor rotary valve, examples of which are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, described below. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one skilled in the art will be able to select the desired valve for the desired application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, as the rotary valve rotates it alternately opens the valve to the lower air compression chamber, shown at <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the valve to the upper explosion chamber, shown at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The air/fuel mixture enters the explosion chamber shown at <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and is ignited by a high pressure wave compressing the mixture, or alternatively by an igniting device, shown at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such as a spark plug. The explosion of the air/fuel mixture starts a pressure wave down the channel of the explosion chamber and curves around until it compresses air previously introduced through the open valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (now closed) against the lower valve plate shown at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The general area where the air is compressed in the combustion chamber is shown generally at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The pressure wave is then reflected back the direction it came and the pressure wave compresses a new air/fuel mixture to create another explosion in the explosion chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is a continuous alternating cycle between explosions creating a pressure wave which compresses air in the air compression chamber and reflections of the pressure wave that compress the air/fuel mixture to cause the explosions. Preferably, the frequency of the explosions is controlled to provide a resonating pressure wave in the tube. This means that the pressure in the tube alternates between the following two stages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (A) high pressure in the compression chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and low pressure in the compressor chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> during the explosion stage; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (B) low pressure in the compression chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and high pressure in the compressor chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> during the compressing of the air (compression stage). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Examples of means for adjusting the frequency of explosions in the combustion chamber include; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> (1) adjusting the length of the tube; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (2) adjusting the frequency of the air/fuel mixture entering the combustion chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (3) adjusting the temperature of gas contained within combustion chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> (4) adjusting the amount of air/fuel mixture being supplied to the combustion chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (5) adjusting the speed of the rotary valve; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (6) adjusting the relative flow areas, shown at <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The combustion chamber can be adjusted to be a length that provides the desired resonant frequency. For example, if the length of the tube is one-half of the pressure wave length and the frequency of explosions resonate, then the pressure at somewhere near the middle of the wave travel remains practically constant (about an average of the combustion chamber pressure), but is significantly higher than the inlet pressure coming from the air compressor. Examples of suitable combustion chamber lengths for providing a resonating pressure wave include, but are not limited, to the following combustion chamber lengths shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a combustion chamber having a length that is one-half of the wave length of the pressure wave. Between the points E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the combustion chamber, the pressure variation is significantly less than elsewhere in the combustion chamber, such as at the first reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or at the second reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the pressure varies from P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Between the points E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the pressure varies significantly less than between P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, the gas flow taker from the combustion chamber between the points E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will fluctuate significantly less than the gas flow taken elsewhere from the combustion chamber. Preferably, the gas flow taken from the combustion chamber is at substantially the average combustion chamber pressure, shown at P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a combustion chamber having a length that is one wave length of the pressure wave. Between the points E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or the points E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the combustion chamber, the pressure variation is significantly less than elsewhere in the combustion chamber, such as at the first reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or at the second reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the pressure varies from P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Between the points E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or between E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the pressure varies significantly less than between P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, the gas flow taken from the combustion chamber between the points E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or between the points E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will fluctuate significantly less than the gas flow taken elsewhere from the combustion chamber. Preferably, the gas flow taken from the combustion chamber is at substantially the average combustion chamber pressure, shown at P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The resonating pressure waves shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> represent a combustion chamber having a constant temperature throughout the length of the combustion chamber. However, when a combustion chamber is used where an air/fuel mixture is injected into the combustion chamber at or near the first reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and air is injected into the combustion chamber at or near the second reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the temperature will be significantly higher near the first reflecting surface where combustion is occurring than at the second reflecting surface. Since the compression wave travels faster as the temperature is increased, the resonating pressure waves shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> will be skewed away from first reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the part of the combustion chamber defined between E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be farther from the first reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and closer to the second reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> than shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Similarly, the parts of the combustion chamber defined between E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and between E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, will be farther from the first reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and closer to the second reflecting surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> than shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one skilled in the art will easily be able to determine the location in the combustion chamber that provides a substantially constant gas flow pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the outlet from the compression chamber, shown at <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is farther away from the inlet for the air/fuel mixture than it is from the inlet for the air. As explained above, since the temperature of the exploding air/fuel mixture is much higher than that of the air in the air compression chamber, the velocity of the pressure wave corresponding to acoustic velocity in the gas is much higher in the hotter explosion chamber than in the colder compression chamber. Typically, the acoustic velocity is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature. Therefore, the point at which the pressure remains constant in the system with proper tuning will be closer to the air compression chamber portion than it is to the explosion chamber portion of the combustion chamber. The hot exploding air/fuel mixture forms a hot combustion gas that mixes with the cooler air compression gases to form a pressurized gas having a temperature somewhere between the explosion temperature (or combustion temperature of the fuel/air mixture) and the air compression temperature. The pressurized gas then flows out of the combustion chamber through turbine nozzles to drive the turbine blades. The result of this system is that the pressure of the pressurized gas contacting the turbine blades can be considerably higher than the pressure of the compressed air formed by the air compressor. In particular, the exploding air/fuel mixture forms a pressure wave that acts as a piston to further compress the compressed air introduced into the compression chamber portion of the combustion chamber to form a mixture of twice compressed air and combustion gasses, referred to as pressurized gas. The pressurized gas o can be withdrawn from the combustion chamber at a pressure significantly higher than the pressure of the compressed air entering the combustion chamber. Furthermore, the temperature of the pressurized gas leaving the combustion chamber is significantly less than the air/fuel mixture explosion temperature (or combustion temperature of the air/fuel mixture). Thus, more air/fuel mixture can be burned in the combustion chamber according to the present invention while not exceeding the temperature limit of the turbine blades, o compared to conventional combustion chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a pressure volume diagram that is applicable to the high pressure cycle described above. The air enters at a first pressure and volume, shown at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and is compressed isentropically to a second pressure and volume, shown at <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. At this point, approximately one-half of the air is mixed with fuel and explodes to a high pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The pressure wave formed expands isentropically and the pressure decreases to a lower pressure and greater volume, shown at <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The energy of expansion is approximately equal to the energy required to compress the air from the pressure and volume shown at <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the pressure and volume shown at <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. This results in an intermediate pressure corresponding to the pressure shown at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When the hot gas mixes at the pressure and volume shown at <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, with the air at the pressure and volume shown at <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, they end up at a specific pressure and volume shown at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. From the pressure and volume of the gases shown at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the gasses expand to approximately atmospheric pressure, shown at <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and eventually reduce in specific volume back to the volume shown at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, external to the system. The temperature at the pressure and volume shown at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be much higher than the temperature of the gas that enters the gas turbine because after expansion from the volume shown at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to the volume shown at <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and mixing with the compressed air shown at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the temperature of the gas is much lower. Therefore, the effective explosion temperature (or combustion temperature of the fuel/air mixture) is significantly higher than the temperature of the pressurized gas that contacts the turbine blades. This then makes use of the potential of operating the combustion system at much higher combustion temperatures than is currently possible with a turbine operating on the Brayton Cycle, because-the temperature of the pressurized gas contacting the turbine blades is lower than the combustion temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The rotary valve illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> has 3 holes, shown at <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The rotary valve illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> has 5 holes, shown at <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The circles represent the location of the holes in the stationary plate with one hole representing the inlet to the combustion chamber and the other hole representing the inlet to the air compression chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the rotary valve has holes aligned whereby the valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is open when the valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is closed, and the valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is open when the valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is closed. For example, if the valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are placed in line with the central axis of the rotary valve, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the rotary valve should have an odd number of holes so that valves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are not open at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Since the explosion can reach a very high temperature, it may be necessary to cool the walls of the chamber. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> cooling jacket is shown at <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, that can be used to cool the explosion chamber portion of the combustion chamber. Optionally, water-cooled walls can be used for the entire combustion chamber if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The combustion chamber shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> utilizes a mixture of fuel/air. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a turbine engine similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, with the following modifications. In the turbine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, fuel is not introduced into the air chamber preceding the combustion chamber. Instead, air is introduced to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>&prime; through the valve shown at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;. Fuel is introduced into the combustion chamber through the fuel inlet shown at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The fuel mixes with the air in the explosion chamber portion of the combustion chamber, shown generally at <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When using the combustion chamber shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the fuel injection should alternate in tune with the air inlet valve to the chamber. The fuel injection can be timed with an injection pump, if liquid fuel, or with a valve, if gaseous fuel, so that the fuel enters at approximately the same time as the air enters through valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an optional annular space around the explosion chamber, shown at <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This annular air space allows the compressed air in the air compression chamber to help cool the wall of the explosion chamber. However, since the explosion temperature can be high, further cooling of the explosion chamber wall may be desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the pressure wave travels to the end of the explosion chamber, turns, and travels toward the air compression chamber, shown generally at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;. The spherical end, shown at <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, may cause a reflection of the pressure wave and disrupt the single frequency resonating pressure wave in the combustion chamber. This undesirable reflection could be avoided, for example, by using the U tube design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or a straight tube as the combustion chamber. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates an annular space, shown at <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> around the combustion chamber. The two curves at the right hand end of the tube serve to deflect the pressure wave smoothly without an intermediate reflection, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The pressurized gas outlet, shown at <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, to the turbine, shown at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is closer to the air compression chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; than the explosion chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime;. As discussed previously, the high temperature exploding air/fuel mixture compression wave has a higher acoustic velocity, and therefore in the same time travels farther than the lower temperature compression wave in the air compression chamber. Therefore, the outlet to the turbine should not be at one-half the total length of the chamber but should be closer to the air compression end, when a substantially constant pressure is desired and when using a combustion chamber having a length equal to one-half wavelength of the pressure wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Although it is possible to have the fuel injected separately into the explosion chamber, usually it is more desirable to have the fuel mixed with the air prior to introducing the air and fuel to the explosion chamber. Therefore in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the fuel inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> connects to the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a divider plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> separates the air/fuel mixture from the air prior to entering the explosion chamber. This scheme is usually more desirable than having the fuel injected directly into the explosion chamber for the following reasons: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> (1) The air/fuel mixture is usually more uniformly mixed compared to fuel injection because the air/fuel mixture has time to mix thoroughly before the explosion occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> (2) The ignition of the air/fuel mixture can be more easily generated by the pressure wave itself than when using fuel injection. Ignition via the pressure wave usually provides a more substantially constant volume explosion than is possible when using a spark plug to ignite the fuel. Constant volume explosion improves the theoretical efficiency of the explosion chamber system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> (3) By having the air/fuel thoroughly mixed before the explosion, the explosion temperatures can be more uniform than when using a flame propagation created by a spark plug. This is desirable because the variation of temperature will be considerably less than that when flame propagation occurs. This has the effect of reducing formation of nitrogen oxides and other undesirable combustion by-products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> A problem with mixing the fuel and air prior to entering the explosion chamber may be that the air temperature leaving the compressor could be too high, which can lead to undesirable combustion in the mixing chamber. This could be prevented by intercooling the air going through the air compressor so that the temperature of the air leaving the air compressor is low enough that detonation will not occur in the mixing chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In the Otto Cycle used in automobile engines, where fuel and air are mixed before compression, the limiting value of compression ratio is approximately 8:1 to 10:1, corresponding to a pressure ratio of approximately 25 to 1, to avoid detonation. By intercooling air as it passes through the compressor, it is possible to limit the temperature of the air entering the mixing chamber to avoid detonation. This makes it possible to use higher pressure ratios than are normally possible with the Otto Cycle used in the automobile engine. If the mixture is then ignited by the pressure wave returning from the compression end of the combustion chamber, the explosion occurs throughout the mixture and can reach a higher pressure than is possible if it occurs by flame propagation. In other words, by intercooling the air compressor significantly higher pressure ratios can be used while mixing the air and fuel before introducing them into the explosion chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a remarkable advantage because use of the detonation characteristics of fuel are utilized, rather than attempting to suppress the detonation characteristics as is usually done in conventional automobile engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the temperature of the combustion gas at point <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be much higher than the temperature of the pressurized gas that enters the gas turbines because after expansion from <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the combustion gas is mixed with the compressed gas at <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to form a pressurized gas. The temperature of the pressurized gas is less than the temperature of the combustion gas. Therefore, the effective burning temperature can be much higher than the temperature of the pressurized gas that enters the gas turbine. This then makes use of the potential of operating the system at much higher temperatures than is currently possible with a gas turbine operating on the Brayton Cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Performance values for the high pressure cycle according to the present invention are shown in the following Table 2. Table 3 illustrates the equations used for determining the performance values shown in Table 2. The calculations are based on what is considered to be the air standard cycle with constant mass flow through the system, and no addition of mass for the fuel, constant specific heats throughout the cycle and other possible operating conditions.

<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Row 45 the efficiency is simply the net work divided by item <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the heat input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The efficiencies shown in Table 2 do not take fully into account other losses that should be accounted for in an actual turbine, and therefore the efficiencies may be slightly lower than those shown above. Despite these additional losses not shown in the Table 2, the remarkable increase in efficiency shown in Table 2 compared to Table 1 is very significant and startling. For example, in comparing column c in Table 2 with column c in Table 1, the increase in efficiency is almost 20% . This difference is even more accentuated when using an intercooled system. For example comparing column j in Table 2 with column j in Table 1, the increase in efficiency is 22% . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The turbine and compressor polytropic efficiencies of 0.9 are rather typical of what is attained in gas turbines today. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The efficiency of the explosion process was not calculated and was assumed to be 100% . The following important factors should be noted regarding the explosion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> 1. There will be less heat loss from the combustion chamber according to the present invention than what occurs in a Diesel engine cylinder. The reason for this is that with a gas piston in the explosion chamber the walls can be much hotter than the walls in a diesel engine cylinder where lubrication is required. Therefore, the radiation or convection heat loss should be much less in the high pressure cycle according to the present invention than in a Diesel cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> 2. There should be a very low friction loss in the present invention because compression is achieved using a compression wave instead of a piston. Furthermore, if the average velocity in the explosion chamber is at most about 200 feet per second, then friction loss becomes negligible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> 3. The efficiency of a traveling pressure wave is very high. For example, a tidal wave or tsunami can travel thousands of miles across the ocean with very little diminution of energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> 4. When a detonation type of explosion is made to occur, as in the present invention, the explosion should be very close to constant volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In Table 2, columns D and E show the considerable improvement in efficiency and output compared to column C, which is made possible by refrigerating the inlet air to 400&deg; R or 460&deg; R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Refrigerating the inlet air to the compressor, as shown on columns F through L, makes possible liquid injection intercooling. This liquid injection intercooling is made possible because refrigerating the inlet air removes the moisture from the air stream, and makes it possible to inject water and evaporate it within the compressor, thereby performing effective intercooling with very little losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> In columns C through L, the percentage of air in the explosion process has been adjusted to allow the turbine inlet temperature, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to be approximately 2810&deg; R which is a usable turbine inlet temperature in modern day turbines. Note that in both Table 1 and 2, the various degrees of intercooling maintain fairly constant cycle efficiency, but the net work output increases very greatly with more intercooling. Therefore, liquid injection intercooling and inlet refrigeration become very important factors in increasing the power output of a given size turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Columns M and N show the effect of increasing the explosion temperature closer to the stoichiometric value when compared to column C. This demonstrates that the efficiency will increase with higher explosion temperatures at the same turbine inlet temperature by virtue of the fact that the X value or ratio of V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is adjusted to produce the same turbine temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The peak pressure values shown on line 17 appear to be quite high. However, it should be noted that current peak pressure ratios on diesel engines are as high as 200. Therefore, these high peak pressures should be reasonably achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> An important factor in comparing Table 2 with Table 1 is that the gas volume introduced into the turbine shown on line 20 in the Brayton Cycle versus V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on line 33 on table 1 shows that the volume of the gas entering the turbine is much less in Table 2 than it is in Table 1. For example, on column J which is an intercooled case, the volume entering the turbine in Table 2 is 0.547 cubic feet per lb whereas the volume of V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on column J for the Brayton Cycle is 2.210 cubic feet per lb This is a ratio of 4 to 1. The significance of this is that the turbine blades in the high pressure cycle according to the present invention can be approximately one-fourth of the length of turbine blades for the Brayton Cycle A short blade length means that the turbine blade stresses are significantly lower and they will be significantly easier to cool than the longer blades for the Brayton Cycle. This in turn means that higher turbine inlet temperatures could be used, which is an important practical advantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> An important factor in the high pressure cycle according to the present invention is that exhaust temperatures can be much lower than those generally achievable in the Brayton Cycle turbines in use today. For example, in column J line 36, the exhaust temperature from the cycle is 794&deg; R or 334&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Typical exhaust temperatures from modern gas turbines range from 700&deg; F. to 1240&deg; F. In contrast, an exhaust temperature from a turbine engine according to the present invention is significantly lower, on the order of about 300&deg; F. to about 500&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Vapor turbine cycles typically operate efficiently in the range of from 800 to 160&deg; F. inlet temperature. Thus, the exhaust from the turbine engine according to the present invention can be used directly to drive a vapor turbine cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In general, high exhaust temperatures correspond to low compressor pressure ratios, and low exhaust temperatures occur with higher pressure ratios. However, in the turbine engine according to the present invention, the exhaust pressure can also be adjusted by adjusting the amount of air being compressed in the air compression chamber. In general, the more air being mixed with and compressed by the combustion gas compression wave, the lower the exhaust temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Because of the great demand for higher efficiency gas turbine cycles, it is today increasingly common practice to use a combined cycle in which the exhaust gas is used to heat a Rankine cycle system, and produce additional power and increased efficiency. Typically those cycles utilizing exhaust gas temperatures of 1100&deg; F. require that a steam turbine cycle be used to recover the exhaust energy. This is very expensive, and high pressure steam turbines are usually not efficient. Also, high pressure steam turbines cannot economically use condensing temperatures very close to atmospheric temperature because the volume expansion ratio through such a steam turbine is extremely high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> However, if the exhaust temperature from the gas turbine is as low as 334&deg; F., then this heat can be conveniently used in a low temperature vapor turbine cycle, using a working fluid such as isobutane. This cycle attains a significantly higher turbine efficiency than a steam turbine, and also permits utilizing condensing temperatures very close to atmospheric temperatures. This also has the significance that the heat of condensation of the water vapor in the exhaust can be recovered. Therefore, the overall cycle efficiency can be significantly higher than that for other combined cycles in use today. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> In gas turbine cycles in use today, it is common practice to use cooling air supplied by the compressor to be injected into the first stage turbine disk and out through holes in the turbine blades, thereby cooling the blades so that higher inlet temperatures can be used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates diagrammatically how this can be accomplished using the high pressure cycle according to the present invention. In order to provide air at sufficiently high pressure to force its way through the cooling passages in the turbine blades, the blade cooling air supply line, shown at <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is located where the combustion chamber pressure varies greatly, such as near an inlet to the compression chamber. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the blade cooling air supply line can be located in the combustion chamber where the combustion chamber pressure approaches P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, such as between the points E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the points R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or the points R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A check valve can also be installed in the line to prevent backflow into the combustion chamber. The pulsating pressure at these locations can be high enough so that pulses of cooling air are sent to the turbine blades. As pointed out above, the turbine blades can be much shorter, and therefore much easier to cool than the long turbine blades required for the Brayton Cycle system. Therefore the amount of cooling air required to cool the blades can be greatly reduced compared to a conventional gas turbine, both because less cooling air is required, and because with intercooling of the compressor, the air coming from the compression chamber is colder than it is from the ordinary gas turbine compressor discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an alternative blade cooling system in which steam is used to cool the turbine blades. This has several potential advantages. Steam has a higher heat transfer coefficient than air, and therefore for a given temperature in the cooling line the cooling becomes more effective. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, steam cooling can be supplied by having the water jacket around the explosion chamber be fed with a high pressure pump, shown at <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, that keeps the water pressure above the boiling point. The high pressure water can then be expanded through a throttle valve, shown at <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, part of it will flash into steam in the high pressure flash tank shown at <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and this steam can then be sent through the line shown at <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to cool the turbine blades. The water at the bottom of the flash tank can be returned to the inlet of the high pressure pump using the line shown at <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. An additional water supply pump, shown at <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, can feed make up water into the water return line <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. This system is potentially more efficient than the system using air to cool the turbine blades because the heat loss from the explosion chamber is used directly to generate the steam that cools the turbine blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Although the steam cooling system described above may be very attractive, it may also be possible to eliminate use of a water jacket on the explosion chamber simply by increasing the heat transfer from the outside of the explosion chamber walls. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the incoming air surrounds the explosion chamber in the air chamber shown at <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The fins, shown at <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, on the combustion wall transmit much more heat to the air than would be the case if the wall were smooth. By calculation, it appears that this scheme of cooling the walls may be more efficient, and also less costly than using water jackets either for direct cooling or for providing steam cooling to the blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Preliminary estimates of the potential size of the combustion chambers required for a high pressure cycle can be made by assuming a mass flow of air into the system and assuming conditions of operation as shown on column J of Table 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Assuming a flow of 385 pounds per second at conditions specified on column J. The net output of the turbine is then 194.7 BTUs per pound of air. The turbine output equals pounds per second times BTUs per pound times kilowatts per BTUs per second. The output would then be 385 times 194.7 times 1.055 equals 79,000 kilowatts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The volume flow to the combustor equals 385 times 0.6309 cubic feet per pound at the compressor outlet or equals 242.9 cubic feet per second. At what might be considered a reasonable velocity of 200 feet per second the flow area would be 242.9/200, which equals 1.214 square feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> If six combustors are used, the area for each equals 1.214/6&equals;0.2024 square feet or the diameter of the chamber equals 6.09 inches. This appears to be a reasonable size for a turbine of this capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The lengths of the combustors can be estimated by assuming a frequency of explosions and a mean acoustic velocity of the ignited gas and of the compressed gas in the compressor section. A mean temperature in the explosion end might be 3880&deg; R and the acoustic velocity might be approximately 3005 feet per second. If the distributor valve having three holes is rotated at a rotating speed of 1800 RPM, then the wave period would be {fraction (1/90)} of a second. At a period of {fraction (1/90)} of a second, one quarter wave length would be 1/90&times;3005/4&equals;8.35 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In the compression end, assuming the mean temperature would be approximately 981&deg; R, the acoustic velocity should be approximately 1511 feet per second. One quarter wave length would then be 4.20 feet. Based on these calculations, the total length of the combustion chamber should then be (8.35&plus;4.20)&equals;12.55 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> These sample calculations indicate that the size of the combustor for the high pressure cycle can be very reasonable, and can be fitted around the circumference of a turbine producing an output of about 79 megawatts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Although the location in the combustion chamber where the gas mixture leaves to enter the turbine should be at a constant pressure, it is very likely that the pressure may not be exactly constant, and some pulsations in the pressure may occur. This may be undesirable if more than one combustor is used and all combustors fire in unison. Therefore, in order to minimize the pressure pulsation effect on the turbine inlet nozzles and blades the explosions in the separate combustion chambers should be synchronized so that they are out of phase, such as by having one-half of the combustion chambers being out of phase with the other half. Another solution for minimizing these pulsations at the turbine inlet would be to use slightly different lengths for the combustion chambers and slightly different frequencies of explosions. Either of these methods should assure that undesirable turbine blade vibrations can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> While a combustion chamber having two gas inlets has been described, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that the present invention can be practiced using one gas inlet. When using one gas inlet as opposed to two or more gas inlets, less gas may be pressurized in the air compression portion of the combustion chamber and the temperature of the pressurized gas leaving the combustion chamber will be higher. Thus, a combustion chamber having at least two gas inlets is preferred because more gas is compressed in the air compression chamber portion of the combustion chamber and the temperature of the pressurized gas leaving the combustion chamber will be significantly lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> While the location of the gas outlet in the combustion chamber has been described as being located where the combustion chamber pressure is substantially constant, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that the gas outlet can be located elsewhere if desired. For example, if a substantially constant pressure is not required for the desired application, the gas outlet can be located in the combustion chamber where the combustion chamber pressure varies significantly. If maximum pressure is the goal, the gas outlet can be located near one of the reflecting surfaces, or other area in the combustion chamber where the combustion chamber pressure peaks (such as between E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). In such applications, it may be desirable to use a check valve to prevent backflow into the combustion chamber. However, for most applications a constant gas pressure is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> While a U-shaped combustion chamber has been described above, it is understood by one skilled in the art that the shape of the combustion can be adjusted as desired. For example, the combustion chamber can be substantially straight or a combination of U-shapes. If desired, the combustion chamber can have a circular shape or a spiral shape that surrounds the turbine. The main concern is that the combustion chamber be constructed and arranged to provide at least one resonating pressure wave therein. Furthermore, the combustion chamber can have varying dimensions along the length thereof. For example, the volume per set length of the combustion chamber located near a reflecting surface can be greater than the volume per set length of the combustion chamber elsewhere, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In general, the greater the volume per set length of combustion chamber the lower the pressure of the gas contained therein. Preferably, the side walls of the combustion chamber, in the direction of the pressure wave travels, have substantially a round tube shape, as used in the Example. However, the side walls of the combustion chamber can also have as square, triangular, hexagonal, elliptical, or other shapes. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one skilled in the art will be able to select the desired dimensions of the combustion chamber to provide the desired resonating pressure wave and pressurized gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The high pressure cycle according to the present invention provides many important advantages over previously used gas turbine cycles as listed here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> 1. The high pressure cycle can obtain higher thermal efficiencies than any cycle heretofore presented. This is important for saving fuel in an energy hungry world that is gradually depleting all available sources of fossil fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> 2. The high pressure cycle has a higher efficiency and emits less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is recognized today as an important factor in affecting the climate of the world, and is now considered so important that predictions are being made that a carbon tax will be imposed for all of the carbon dioxide emitted from a power plant into the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> 3. The use of detonation to ignite the air/fuel mixture provides improved burning with significantly reduced production of undesirable nitrogen oxides and other combustion by-products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> 4. Refrigerating the inlet to a gas turbine removes the moisture from the air and thereby permits liquid injection intercooling, which in turn permits higher efficiency and higher capacity to be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> 5. Refrigerating the inlet to the gas turbine greatly increases the output power for a given size turbine. This means a great deal in reducing the cost per kilowatt power output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> 6. Liquid injection intercooling makes premixing of the fuel with the air possible, and assures that detonation in the combustion chamber is possible. This in turn assures more uniform combustion and less generation of nitrogen oxides in the combustion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> 7. In the high pressure cycle, the specific volume of the gas entering the turbine is much lower than that entering typical gas turbine blades. Therefore, the turbine blades can be shorter, easier to cool, and will be subject to less stress by nature of the blades being shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> 8. Better blade cooling because of the shorter blades makes higher turbine inlet temperatures possible, which in turn increases potential turbine efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> 9. The higher efficiency of the high pressure cycle assures lower exhaust temperatures, which in turn assures higher overall efficiencies for combined cycles, because lower expansion ratios for the Rankine cycle can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> 10. In the combined cycle, the use of a steam turbine can be avoided, and it is possible to use isobutane as the working fluid in the Rankine cycle which is run from the exhaust of the gas turbine. This permits condensing at much lower exhaust temperatures than can be used in a steam cycle, and in turn permits recovery of water from the exhaust. Recovery of water becomes more and more important as water becomes a scarce commodity throughout the world. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an improved electrical power generating plant comprising at least one of the novel turbines described herein above driving an electrical generator. Any conventional electrical generator can be used to convert the mechanical energy of the turbine to electrical power. The power plant utilizing the improved turbine engines is capable of producing significantly less carbon dioxide and undesirable combustion by-products such as nitrogen oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the improved power plant further contains a Rankine cycle to utilize the energy contained in the exhaust gas of the turbine engine. The turbine engines according to the present invention can be driven to provide exhaust gasses having a temperature suitable for use in low temperature vapor turbine cycle, such as isobutane. Examples of other suitable low temperature vapor turbine cycles include propane, propylene, or other hydrocarbons, as well as fluorocarbons, and chlorofluorocarbons, of which there are many compounds commercially available. A low temperature vapor cycle typically operates at a temperature of about 400&deg; F. or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> The exhaust from a turbine engine according to the present invention is sufficiently low enough for directly driving a low temperature vapor cycle. This is a remarkable improvement because low temperature vapor turbine cycles are significantly more efficient and less expensive than high temperature vapor turbine cycles, such as steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> illustrates an example of power plant according to the present invention. Air enters the system through the air inlet saturation cooler shown at <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. An air inlet fan shown at <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be used to draw the air into the system. The air can then be cooled by passing through the air inlet refrigeration coils shown at <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The cooled air can be compressed using the compressor shown at <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The air can also be intercooled in the compressor so as to control the temperature of the compressed air leaving the compressor down to a temperature where fuel can be injected into or mixed with the compressed air without causing combustion prior to entering the combustion chamber. The compressed air can be further compressed and combusted by using the resonating combustion chamber shown at <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. This combustion chamber can be any one or combination of combustion chambers described herein above. After being compressed and combusted, the air can be used to drive a turbine, shown at <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The turbine can be used to drive an electrical generator shown at <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The air inlet refrigeration coils can be refrigerated, for example, by using the low stage refrigerant compressor shown at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the high stage refrigerant compressor shown at <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, and the refrigerant condenser shown at <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The exhaust from the turbine in the present invention can surprisingly be made low enough to drive a low temperature vapor cycle. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the exhaust from the turbine is used to vaporize isobutane in the isobutane superheater shown at <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The superheated isobutane can be used to drive the low pressure vapor turbine engine shown at <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> The low pressure vapor turbine engine can be used to drive an electrical generator shown at <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The exhaust from the low pressure vapor turbine engine can be heated in the liquid heater shown at <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and then transferred to the liquid heater and boiler shown at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Hot gas leaving the isobutane superheater <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is passed through the liquid heater and boiler <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The heated isobutane from the liquid heater and boiler <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can be used to drive a high pressure vapor turbine shown at <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The high pressure turbine can be used to drive an electrical generator shown at <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Exhaust from the liquid heater and boiler can be expelled through the exhaust stack with the induced draft fan shown at <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Isobutane usually exhausts from turbine <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> at temperatures well above the saturation or condensing temperature. Therefore, this isobutane exhaust can be used in the liquid heater <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, which preheats liquid isobutane coming from boiler feed pump <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> before it enters gas heated heater and boiler <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> After leaving the liquid heater <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> the isobutane condenses to liquid in condenser <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and the liquid then flows to pump <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, from whence it is pumped into liquid heater <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> to be preheated before entering boiler <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The air condenser <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> is cooled by air drawn over the condenser coils <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> by the induced draft fan <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Before passing through condenser coils <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, the air is cooled to nearly the wet bulb temperature by passing the air through air saturator <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. The saturator <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is cooled by water sprayed over the opening of the saturator surfaces. The water flows down through the surfaces countercurrent to the air flow, and evaporates into the air, thereby cooling the air to nearly the wet bulb temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Since the wet bulb temperature may be as high as 20 to 30&deg; Fahrenheit below the ambient dry bulb temperature, the cooled air condenses the isobutane in condenser <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> to a much lower temperature than would be possible if ambient air was circulated over the condenser coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> The lower condensing temperature achieved increases power output from isobutane turbine <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, and thereby increases power cycle efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The invention will be further explained using the following non-limiting examples. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> A combustion chamber was formed using a 4 inch diameter tube having a length of approximately 20 feet. The inlet air was controlled by a rotary valve which alternately opened and closed the supply of air from an air compression system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> At the opposite end of the tube was an air compressor check valve, which allowed air to enter when the pressure wave was less than the average pressure in the combustion chamber and automatically close when the pressure wave was greater than the average pressure in the combustion chamber. The exhaust outlet from the combustion chamber was approximately at the middle of the tube. High frequency pressure transducers were installed at both ends of the tube, and also at the middle where the exhaust left through a throttling valve. The pressures were recorded on a high speed oscillograph with pressure plotted against time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> By adjusting the frequency of the rotary inlet valve and fuel flow, the explosions of the fuel/air mixture could be made to resonate. By actual measurements, the explosion pressure varied up and down, and the pressure at the opposite air inlet end also varied with the explosion pressure transmitted from the explosion at the fuel air mixture inlet end. The pressure at the exhaust near the middle of the chamber was substantially constant when the timing of the pressure wave was controlled to resonate so that the length of the chamber was approximately one-half the wave length of the explosion wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> By experimenting and adjusting the frequency of the wave so that it resonated, the pressure ratio between the exhaust pressure and the inlet pressure was 1.04. A pressure ratio of 1.04 in a combustion process provides a significant increase in the efficiency of a gas turbine cycle, compared to one which had constant pressure combustion or somewhat less than constant pressure combustion due to friction in the combustion chamber causing a pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet to the turbine nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> One of the critical problems in the experimental chamber was that the air inlet check valve could not be made to survive the high frequencies used in the explosion chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> However, in the design proposed above, the inlet distributor valve controls the flow both to the explosion chamber and to the air compression chamber. This can be accomplished as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> by using a distributor valve with either three or five holes in it, so that the inlet hole to the explosion chamber opens alternately with the inlet hole to the air compression chamber. By using a return channel, the whole system is in effect folded so that the inlet to the explosion chamber and the inlet to the air compression chamber are both at the same end, and therefore can be controlled by a distributor valve motor that is operated at the correct frequency to cause resonating explosions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments, it is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. </paragraph>
