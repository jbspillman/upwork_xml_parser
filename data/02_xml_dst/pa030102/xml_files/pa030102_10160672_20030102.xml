<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Interferometric scanning method(s) and apparatus for measuring rotationally and non-rotationally symmetric test optics either having aspherical surfaces or that produce aspherical wavefronts by comparing known and unknown spherical and aspherical shapes.. Preferably, a spherical or partial spherical wavefront or reflecting surface is defined with respect to a known origin along a scanning axis. The test optic is aligned with respect the scanning axis and selectively moved along it relative to the known origin so that the spherical shape intersects the test optic at the apex of the aspherical shape and at radial positions where the spherical shape and the aspheric shape intersect at points of common tangency. An axial distance, v, and optical path length, p, are interferometrically measured as the test optic is axially scanned by the spherical shape where v is the distance by which the test optic is moved with respect to the origin and p is the optical path length difference between the apex of an aspherical shape associated with the test optic and the apex of the circles of curvature that intersect the aspherical shape at the common points of tangency. Coordinates of the aspherical surface are calculated wherever the circles of curvature have intersected the aspherical shape and in correspondence with the interferometrically measured distances, v and p. Afterwards, the aspheric shape is calculated. Where the test optic comprises a refracting optic a known spherical reflecting surface is provided upstream of the refracting optic for movement along the optical axis and a known wavefront is made to transit the refracting optic, reflects from the known spherical surface, again transits the refracting optic traveling towards the known origin after which the interferogram is formed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In general, this invention relates to the field of interferometry and, in particular, to the high accuracy measurement of aspherical surfaces and wavefronts in an absolute manner. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Aspherical surfaces have become more and more important in modern optical systems because they offer a higher number of parameters for simplifying systems while optimizing their performance. This can lead to systems with less surfaces, less weight, smaller dimensions and higher states of correction, to mention only a few advantages. This is especially true in fields where a high number of optical surfaces are not practical, like in astronomical telescopes or normal incidence reflecting surfaces for the EUV wavelength of 13.6 nm used for lithography tools where it is mandatory to keep the number of surfaces as low as possible. In such cases, there is no choice but to use aspherical surfaces. With demands for high quality performance for complete systems operating in the EUV-regime, the surface errors of reflecting surfaces within such a system must be kept below 0.1 nm, and the measuring accuracy and precision for such errors must be even higher to be able to produce the surfaces in a deterministic manner. In addition, lens surfaces in multielement lithography lenses operating at wavelengths of 193 nm and 157 nm are made aspherical to lower the number of elements made, which are of rare and expensive materials. In these cases, the departures from a best fitting sphere can be as large as 1000 &mgr;m, and the dimensions of such lens surfaces have increased to nearly 500 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In an optical system, the function of any its lens elements is to modify the wavefront transmitted by the individual lens elements according to the optical design of the whole system. If a spherical wave or a plane wave enters such a lens, an aspherical wavefront with a very high departure from the best fitting sphere is produced, depending on the conjugates used in the particular test-configuration. So, even the fundamental single lens element, with either spherical or aspherical surfaces can only be tested properly if one is able to deal with aspherical wavefronts in a test set-up. Moreover, this ability is very important for testing wavefronts transmitted through lens elements because inhomogeneity of the lens material itself can deteriorate the wavefront, even when the surfaces are otherwise free of error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The measurement of aspherical surfaces and wavefronts has been very difficult because of the large departure from the best fitting sphere. With interferometric measurements, high precision is possible by making the dynamic range of the measurement very small, and for this purpose, the wavefront of the reference wavefront, against which the aspherical wavefront is compared, has to be made aspherically as well to ideally fit the wavefront to be measured completely. In prior art, this has been done either by refractive systems, so called &ldquo;null-lenses&rdquo;, or with diffractive elements, so called &ldquo;computer generated holograms&rdquo;, which alter a wave of known and measurable shape (spherical or preferably plane wave) as it transits the compensation element to fit the design aspherical surface at the location where it is placed in the test-set up by design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In all these cases, the compensation element must be tested to be sure that the correct wavefront is delivered for comparison. But, it is obvious that the same difficulties exist for this type of testing because, again, an aspherical wavefront is produced. Therefore, only indirect test methods are applied by, for instance, measuring the surface of each lens element used in a null system, which is exclusively built with the help of spherical surfaces. Also, the refractive index of the lens material, the lens thickness and the air-spacing of the lenses are measured carefully. Nevertheless, the final accuracy is questionable because of accumulation of measurement errors and the uncertainty of the homogeneity within the lens material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are many methods and apparatus in the prior art for measuring aspherical optical surfaces as, for example: 1. Contacting and non-contacting stylus based profilers; 2. Contacting and non-contacting stylus based coordinate measuring machines; 3. Spherical wavefront interferometers; 4. Lateral and radial shearing interferometers; 5. Interferometers with null lenses in the measurement path; 6. Scanning spherical wave interferometers; 7. Scanning white light interferometers; 8. Sub-aperture stitching interferometers; 9. Interferometers using computer generated holograms-CGHs; 10. Point diffraction interferometers-PDIs; 11. Longer wavelength interferometry; and 12. Two wavelength interferometry. While these techniques have utility for many applications, they are limited in their operational capabilities or precision compared with those needed for today&apos;s evolving lithography applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Contacting and non-contacting stylus based profilers mechanically scan the aspherical surface under test, and therefore, are slow because they measure only a few data points at a time. Slow techniques are very susceptible to measurement errors due to temperature variations during the measurement. The same limitations apply to contacting and non-contacting stylus based coordinate measuring machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Spherical wavefront interferometers usually require the spacing between the element generating the spherical wavefront and the aspherical surface under test to be scanned thereby increasing the measurement time for the entire surface under test thus introducing another parameter which must be measured, usually by another measurement device, and means, commonly known as stitching, for connecting the data from the various zones which fit as the spacing is scanned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Scanning white light interferometers have many of the same limitations as spherical wavefront interferometers. Lateral and radial shearing interferometers usually measure the slope of the surface under test and thereby introduce measurement errors during the reconstruction of the surface under test via integration of the slopes. This latter type of limitation applies to differential types of profiling techniques as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Sub-aperture stitching interferometers introduce serious measurement errors in the stitching process. Interferometers using computer generated holograms are susceptible to errors introduced by the CGH and stray Moir&eacute; patterns. They are also difficult to calibrate, i.e., know the calibration of the CGH. Point diffraction interferometers are a class of spherical wavefront interferometers, and therefore, have many of the same limitations, as well as poor lateral spatial resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> None of the prior art approaches is entirely satisfactory since each involves a trade-off that places long lead times on the design of the measurement apparatus and method, requires additional fabrication, increases the difficulty of using and calibrating the measurement apparatus, decreases the accuracy and precision, and greatly increases the cost and delivery time of the aspherical optical element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As a result of certain deficiencies in prior approaches to measuring aspheres, it is a principle object of the present invention to provide a method(s) and apparatus for high accuracy absolute measurement of aspherical surfaces or aspherical wavefronts, either the surface of the final optical part or the wavefront of the final optical lens element in transmission, or by absolutely qualifying the compensation elements for the measurement of aspheres, being either of the refractive, diffractive of reflective type, therefore enabling other, more productive methods for the measurement of the components to be produced in volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide method(s) and apparatus for measuring aspherical surfaces and wavefronts with large aspherical departures and surface slopes </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the method and apparatus for measuring aspherical surfaces and wavefronts according to the invention, an aspherical surface is illuminated with a wavefront that fits the shape of the surface only in some locations, which are at the center and a radial &ldquo;zone&rdquo;. In those locations, the surface has the same slope as the illuminating wavefront, i.e., the rays strike the aspherical surface at normal incidence and are reflected back by auto-collimation. It is only in those locations where measurement data points are sampled at the instant of normal incidence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one variation of the basic principle, the incidence of the rays is not normal to the surface, but the parts of the surface where the actual measurement points are sampled act again as to image the light source with unit magnification, but in a reversed real image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the optical path difference between the center and the &ldquo;zone&rdquo; is measured by bringing those rays to interfere with each other and measuring the intensity of the interference. The correct and useful rays for that interference are automatically sampled by the use of an aperture, which is located in the image of the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, an aspherical test surface is shifted along the optical axis, and as it travels, the same center-part as before is hit by rays, which later enter the aperture, but now the &ldquo;zone&rdquo; shifts radially to a new location in correspondence with the axial position of the test surface. In each of the radial &ldquo;zones&rdquo; the criterion of normal incidence or, respectively, the imaging criterion of the light source into the aperture is satisfied. Scanning the aspherical surface axially causes the optical path difference between the rays from the center and the radially moving zone to change, and the measured intensity of the interference is modulated. With a sliding windowing technique and an appropriate phase-measurement algorithm, the phase-information is extracted from the measured intensity, and from the phase, the optical path difference is calculated. This is done with an algorithm that allows computation of not only the axial position, z, on the aspherical surface, but also the lateral height, h, of each radial &ldquo;zone&rdquo;, where the rays are sampled. This is achieved by measuring the optical path difference of the two rays: (1) from the light source to the zone and back to the sampling aperture and (2) from the light source to the center and back to the sampling aperture interferometrically, while also measuring the scanning of the aspherical surface with the help of an external distance measuring interferometer (DMI). Consequently, two quantities are measured with interferometric precision with the condition of autocollimation satisfied where the light rays are incident normal to the surface or, equivalently but more generally, that the light source is imaged onto the sampling aperture with magnification&equals;&minus;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the light source and a corresponding sampling aperture are rings with diameters large enough to be able to resolve the image of the test surface onto the detectors azimuthally and with a ring width that is small enough to isolate the coherent light from the small areas on the test surface that are probed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is a special feature of the invention that the detectors are not located in a conjugate to the test surface in the radial direction (i.e., an image of the surface) as is the case for the azimuthal direction, but in a conjugate (i.e., an image) of the light source. With this arrangement, the rays from the center and the &ldquo;zone&rdquo; are made to interfere because they are not separated on the detector but made to be on top of each other. The imaging optics behind the sampling aperture is an anamorphic one, but in the sense of radial coordinates, not Cartesian as in the usual case. This special anamorphic imaging is derived by a holographic optical element (similar to like a Fresnel zone plate). For detectors, PIN diodes, or the like, having similar sensitivity and frequency response are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a test-set up is calibrated absolutely by measuring an aspherical surface of known shape in the same way as an unknown aspherical surface would be probed, i.e., by scanning axially. This known surface could be a parabola, for instance, which can be measured absolutely with the help of a known plane mirror and a known spherical mirror using known procedures available to measure those surfaces in an absolute manner. Another possibility is to use a lens with spherical surfaces used in transmission together with a known auto-collimation mirror. The lens can be measured in transmission beforehand in an absolute manner with the use of other conjugates.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments together with associated algorithms will now be described in a more detailed manner. Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which shows a simple embodiment of the invention. Light from a coherent light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is focused by a lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into an aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and hits a beamsplitter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is located in the focal plane of a collimator lens <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so a plane wave emerges from the collimating lens <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This plane wave strikes a slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which may be worked into a piece of metal or evaporated onto a glass plate. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> lets rays above the optical axis pass and blocks rays below the optical axis; but a certain region around the optical axis is open all the time, e.g., the slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> does not end exactly at the optical axis (See slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the rays that pass slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>enter a de-collimator lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which focuses the light at a focus point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is an image of aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Lenses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are highly corrected to have only negligible spherical aberration so that a nearly ideal spherical wavefront emanates from focal point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> removed. However, with slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in place, only part of the converging spherical wavefront is directed towards an aspherical test surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The axial position of aspherical test surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be selectively changed by moving it along the optical axis to be scanned by the wavefront emitted from focus point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This is done with the aid of a high-precision mechanical lead <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The position of the aspherical surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be measured by one or more distance measuring interferometer(s) (DMI) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the help of a corner cube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is mounted onto the back side of the mount of the aspherical surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and probed by the rays <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> serving as in- and outgoing measurement beams. It is even more advantageous to use more than one axis for this measurement. For example, use of three corner cubes, with equal distance from the optical axis and circumferentially spaced apart by 120&deg; from each other, can be made to measure not only the shift, but also the tip and tilt of the surface under test and to automatically correct for those in a closed loop arrangement. Similarly, two plane mirrors with their surfaces parallel to the scan-direction (i.e. the optical axis) can be mounted together with the surface under test and probed by another two axes of a DMI to monitor and compensate for lateral shifts which might occur during the movement of the aspheric surface. It is preferred to use sitemaps that account for five degrees of freedom where rotationally symmetric optics are being measured and six degrees of freedom where non-rotationally symmetric optics are measured, so that sufficient control of the movement can be made with high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the extreme left axial position of the aspherical surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the ray on the axis together with the ray <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(the ray <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is actually blocked by the slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) might initially hit the surface at or near normal incidence and the rays in the very vicinity of the axis. In a certain circle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, but also in the vicinity of the ray <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, this condition of normal incidence is violated, but only very slightly. For all the other rays the condition of a perpendicular hit (non-normal incidence) of the surface is violated stronger, so that the out bouncing rays do not coincide with the in bouncing rays. After passing the slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> a second time and after de-collimation by lens <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the rays pass the beamsplitting device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and reach a very small aperture (pinhole) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Only the rays from the center and the rays from the zone where the rays were exactly normal to the surface can pass the pinhole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Directly behind the pinhole is a photodetector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> sensitive at the operating wavelength (preferably a pin-photodiode or a photomultiplier), which senses the interference of the rays from the center and the zone. Thus, all other classes of non-normal rays are spatially filtered from further travel to photodetector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. It should also be noted that the distance between the pinhole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the photodetector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is very small and that the pinhole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> diffracts the light into a cone. Therefore, the wavefronts can overlap and interfere, despite different incidence directions before the pinhole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not shifted axially and when the slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>remains in a constant azimuthal position, the measured intensity can be ideally constant. In the case where there is some air movement within the region where the rays are separated considerably, some fluctuations in the measured intensity may be present in the signal due to differences in the refractive index of the moving air and, accordingly, changes in the optical path difference. Mechanical vibrations of the set up do not result in severe intensity modulations, as is usually the case in interferometry, because to a first order, the optical path difference is desensitized in that regard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not scanned axially but the slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is rotated with a frequency f<highlight><subscript>slit</subscript></highlight>, the measured intensity of the interference of the rays from the zone and the rays from the center can be modulated if the rotational symmetric aspherical surface is not adjusted correctly, e.g., if the optical axis of the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> does not coincide with the optical axis of the test-set up (given by the focal point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together with the vertex of the lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). To avoid this, adjustments can be performed by minimizing the amplitudes of the intensity variation. If the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under inspection has some astigmatism, it may not be possible to bring the amplitude of the intensity variation to zero; nevertheless, a minimum modulation indicates correct adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The measurement of surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is performed by scanning it along a scan axis and at the same time rotating the slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If the scan is started in a position where the focus point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> coincides with the center of curvature for the apex of the surface, i.e. in the position <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, then the surface is probed with two beams, one staying stationary at the center part, the other describing a spiral staying in the center and going all the way out until the very edge of the surface. The number of revolutions of this spiral is given by the number of rotations during the complete scan. This can be adjusted by appropriate setting by a computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, controlling the scan as well as the rotation of the slit-aperture. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another intermediate position of the aspherical surface, close to the starting position <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is shown. Here, the rays <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will later reach the detector and interfere there with the rays from the center. The zone which is probed by these rays is located at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Lead device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to effect axial scanning and is controlled by information from the distance measuring interferometer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is fed to computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for this purpose. Computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also controls the rotation of the slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and gathers the intensity measurements from the interference measured at detector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In addition, computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided with suitable instructions in the form of software for implementing algorithms, performs general housekeeping functions, and serves as an operator interface. It should be pointed out that, as the distance between focus point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> changes with slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> rotating, surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is scanned in spiral fashion with the spiral sweeping out any number of revolutions in response to programmed instructions. A special case occurs when the whole axial scanning is performed without any rotation of the slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the geometry of this situation should be clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In that case, a semi-diameter is probed on the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. After that, the slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is rotated, and the same scanning is repeated again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The evaluation of the aspherical profile of the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for this special case will be described now with the help of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the axial scanning starts at the position <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the surface and ends after an axial shift of v in the position of surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In the starting position <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the surface has a distance of R<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>from the focal point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and in the end-position of surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the distance of the apex of the surface from the focal point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;v. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> cut through the rotationally symmetric aspherical surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is given, establishing an aspherical curve with even symmetry with respect to the z-axis. The following quantities are given: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> K is the best fitting circle with its center on the symmetry&mdash;axis z to the rotational symmetric aspherical curve A. This circle touches the aspherical curve A in the point Q(h,z). The normal to the tangent in Q(h,z) (common to K and to A) cuts the z-axis in the point M(0, R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;v). The distance from Q(h,z) to M(0, R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;v) is given by the radius R&equals;R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;v&minus;p of the circle. The circle cuts the z-axis in point S<highlight><subscript>K</subscript></highlight>(0, p), which is called the apex of the circle. The apex of the aspherical curve is S<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>(0,0), i.e., the distance of the apex of the sphere to the apex of the asphere is p. When the center point M(0, R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;v) of the circle is shifted the distance v along the z-axis, the point Q(h,z) travels along the aspherical curve; when Q(h,z) coincides with the apex of the aspherical curve S<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>(0,0), by definition the shift is v&equals;0. Therefore, the radius of the best fitting circle of the apex of the aspherical curve is R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> For the following, it is assumed that R<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is known and that the center of the circle is shifted the distance v&equals;0 . . .v<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>. Under these conditions, that shift together with the small quantity p is measured. Now, it will be shown that it is possible to compute the coordinates h and z of the point Q(h,z), which defines the aspherical curve for that semi-diameter defined by the azimuthal position of the slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the knowledge of the functions p&equals;p(v) and

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> where A(v) is the mean intensity, B(v) is the modulation and &lgr; is the wavelength used for the measurement. As long as p(v) is a monotonically growing function of the scanning v, then it is possible to capture I(v) with a high sample rate, for example, with 20 readings per period of the cosine function. This can be done in a number of different ways, but only one is described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When the design of the aspherical surface or wavefront is known, the design values of the quantity p(v) can be computed, and the positions v, on which intensity values should be captured, can be determined. Thus, the reading of the detector-values are triggered with this quantity, derived from v. In this case, it is possible to arrange for nearly equal spaced intensity values within one period of the cosine function, and the phase-extraction out of the intensity readings can be done, for instance, with a sliding windowing technique similar to the spatial synchronous detection method described by Womack in Optical Engineering, Vol 23 (1984) 391-395 or by applying one of the many well-known compensating algorithms used for temporal phase-shifting. The assumptions made are that the mean intensity A(v) and the modulation B(v) are only very slowly varying functions and can be thought of being constant for the number of intensity measurements used within one formula. When a high number of intensity values are captured within one period, it is also possible to normalize for fluctuations in A(v) and B(v) by appropriate formulas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After evaluation of p(v), the derivative p&prime;(v) is computed as well by fitting a function (for instance a polynomial or a higher order piecewise spline function) to p&equals;p(v) and calculating the derivative. Then equations (3) and (4) are solved to get the aspherical surface contour for the azimuthal direction &thgr; at which slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Now slit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is rotated by about 179&deg;, and the procedure is repeated for this new azimuthal direction. It should be noted that the scanning can be performed in both directions. After 360 different azimuthal directions, e.g., after 360 scans, the whole surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has been probed with reasonably high density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Assuming an aspherical deviation of 0.5 mm from the sphere, which cuts in 3 points, the aspherical deviation from the sphere which fits the aspherical curve in the apex might be 3 mm, for instance as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Further assuming use is made of laser light with a wavelength of 0.4 &mgr;m with 20 intensity readings per period of the cosine function, then a total of m&equals;20*2*3000 &mgr;m/0.4 &mgr;m&equals;300000 measurements is needed. This can easily be performed within 3 seconds because 100 kHz does not impose a severe burden for the precise A/D-conversion of the intensity readings with high resolution of 12 bit to 14 bit. For a total of 360 scans then, only 18 minutes are necessary only for capturing the data. With the extra time needed for acceleration and slow down of the movement of the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, it is reasonable to judge a total measuring time of 30 minutes, which for some purposes could be considered long. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows traces of the detector ring projected onto the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and that the resolution azimuthally is dependent on the diameter of the ring and the number of detectors within it. From this, it can be appreciated that measurement times can be shortened by using more detectors. spaced for higher sampling rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> To improve measurement speed then, use can be made of multiple detectors instead of the slit aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. To be able to resolve the azimuthal coordinate and, at the same time to let the rays from the zone and the rays from the center interfere with each other and automatically select the rays which at any moment are perpendicular to the aspherical surface, pinholes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are replaced by a very thin ring-shaped aperture, as described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/848,055 filed on May 3, 2001 and entitled &ldquo;APPARATUS AND METHOD(S) FOR REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF COHERENT ARTIFACTS IN AN INTERFEROMETER, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This has the benefit that the azimuthal resolution is preserved, now enabling the use of a multiple detector array in a parallel manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows this modified arrangement where common elements have retained their numerical identity from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The beam from the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transferred by a holographic optical element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into a ring-shaped form as ring aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The width of the ring is very small, on the order of 30 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m. The ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is imaged by lenses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into a second, demagnified ring-image <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The aspherical surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under test images this ring into itself, but with an imaging scale of &bgr;&equals;&minus;1, i.e., the image is inverted with respect to the object. It should be noted that only some parts of surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under test are able to perform this imaging; these parts being again the center part and the &ldquo;zone&rdquo; where the rays from the center of the circle shaped ring-image <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are hit by the normals of the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, i.e., the positions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as well as <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. These positions are imaged by the lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the images located at <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the intervening space between lenses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The ring at <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is further imaged by the lenses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into an image located at <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. This is a final conjugate of the ring-aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, another physical ring-shaped aperture is placed, which acts as a very narrow spatial filter in the radial direction, but has considerable length in the azimuthal direction. In this manner, it is possible to resolve the azimuthal locations on surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Behind the ring-shaped aperture <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which has the same physical dimensions as <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, an a focal or telescope system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located, which images the ring <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> onto an arrangement of detectors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The detectors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shown) are arranged in a circle in the back focal plane of the second lens of the telescope <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The magnification of telescope <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is chosen to optimize the higher number of detectors that can be placed in the ring. If the space is still too small, it might be possible to insert a multifaceted pyramid between the lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the detectors to reflect the light by 90&deg; and thus allow the detectors to all look towards the optical axis thus establishing a larger circle. Also, it would be possible to use a holographic optical element for this purpose, i.e., simultaneously image the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in azimuthal direction and the sensing aperture <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in the radial direction onto detectors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Such a holographic optical element, for simplicity, has not been included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, but is shown in the later <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> as element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Each of the detectors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has its own phase-measuring electronics, so that their corresponding signals can be processed in parallel, but these are not shown explicitly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> as will be understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> If 60 detectors are arranged in a circle, and the same azimuthal resolution as before is assumed, 360 positions at the circumference of the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under test should be resolved, and the time necessary will be reduced from 30 min to 30 seconds. To be able to resolve 360 different azimuthal locations with only 60 detectors, it is necessary to rotate the circle of detectors in 6 steps of 1&deg; each. Better resolution can be achieved if the steps are chosen smaller. It will be reasonable to choose steps of 10, which lead to a total of 2160 positions at the full circle. Assuming a diameter for the aspherical surface of 300 mm means that the spacing of measured points is about 0.44 mm at the outer circumference. The spatial density for sampling data in the radial direction depends on the slope of the deviation of the aspherical surface from the sphere. As an average value, with about 600,000 points on the diameter, the spacing is 0.5 &mgr;m, i.e., in any case fine enough to locate and detect even very tiny ripples. The much higher sampling density in the radial direction is necessary for precise evaluation of the h, z-coordinates with Equations (3) and (4). Because it is necessary to compute the first derivative of the measured phases, noise will be amplified, and therefore, use of a plurality of measured points in conjunction with a piece-wise polynomial fit improves the precision considerably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The foregoing methods of detecting the phase values from the intensity measurements, according to Equation (5) have the drawback that variations in the mean intensity A(v), or in the modulation B(v), influence the computed values of p(v). Therefore, it must be assured that such variations will not take place. Due to the high frequency structure that aspherical surfaces might show and due to the &ldquo;knife-edge like&rdquo; optical arrangement with a very small ring aperture (like a round slit), this assumption may not be satisfied in all situations. Therefore, it could be necessary to use alternative ways for phase-extraction from the measurements with the arrangements given with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> One approach is to use different polarization stages for the beam at the center of the asphere and the beam at the zone. This can be accomplished by an extra-element inserted in the space between lens <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. All other elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> retain their previous numerical identity. This extra element <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is a glass plate, where in the center a double refracting element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is applied, acting as a quarter-wave plate. This is a very small disc of a double refracting crystal, which is cemented to the very center of the glass plate. Because the lens images the surface under test onto the glass-plate, only a very small part of the center of the aspherical surface acts as a reference for the remaining surface. To keep the glass-plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in focus during the scan, it is necessary to axially shift the glass-plate in a computer controlled manner on a precision slide <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When the center part of the beam transverses the quarter-wave plate twice, the linearly-polarized wave has its plane of polarization rotated by 90&deg;. Thus, the two beams are &ldquo;encoded&rdquo; by their polarization states, and the relative phase between the beams can be shifted by polarization controlling optical means. There are at least two possibilities that can be applied, which are given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, four interferograms are gained with a phase shift of 90&deg; between them. This is a so called quadrature signal. With a non-polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, both wavefronts with orthogonal linear polarizations are doubled. Now, a quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in one beam delays the phase of one of the orthogonal polarizations by 90&deg;. After a polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the two wavefronts can interfere and produce two intensity patterns that are out of phase by 180&deg; to each other. Subtracting the signals sensed with two ring-shaped mounted pin-photodiodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> eliminates the bias A(v), and a DC-free signal proportional to

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> results. From the arctangent of these signals the desired quantity p(v) is derived. This technique is applied frequently with distance measuring interferometers and known to have a precision of about 1.0 nm r.m.s.. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, another possibility is shown, which needs only one detector-ring. Here, the phase-shift must be performed in time, i.e., sequentially rather than parallel. This phase-shift can be accomplished in addition to the phase-shift induced by the scanning procedure and also allows for a measurement in azimuthal direction with the rotation of the part under test without any scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The principle of phase-shifting by polarization is well known: two linearly polarized beams with orthogonal polarization directions transit a properly oriented quarter-wave plate and then transit a rotating half-wave plate. Along with the rotation of this plate, phase modulation takes place. The beams can finally interfere when they are made the same polarization with the help of a polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a variation of the set-up of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Again, common elements retain their former identity. The ring-aperture <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is now located between the beamsplitter and a diverging lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, only one such aperture is necessary, which also simplifies adjustment. The two formerly used collimating lenses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are now replaced by one single diverging lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which simplifies the set-up further. Because no intermediate focus <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is used in the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the air-path between the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under test and the diverging lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is shorter. The main difference is in the optical scheme for imaging surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under test onto the detector-ring in azimuthal direction and of the sensing aperture in the radial direction. Consequently, this imaging is a special kind of anamorphic imaging, which can be performed with the help of a holographic optical element, similar to a Fresnel zone plate. This element is shown as <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. It has no power in azimuthal direction. Therefore, the lens <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> together with lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>forms a sharp image of the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> onto the detector ring in azimuthal direction, and the ring-shaped aperture <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> acts as the aperture for that image. In the radial direction, the holographic optical element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided with enough power to image the ring-aperture <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> onto the detector-ring. Here, the focal length of the element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is given by the distance of the detector-ring from element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Together with this imaging (first diffraction order), a magnification of the diameter is accomplished. The holographic element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the detector ring must be refocused when the surface is scanned. This is done with a computer-controlled precision slide <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and a motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the testing of an aspherical wavefront is shown, which is delivered by a lens <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is probed by a spherical wave and a spherical auto-collimation mirror. The auto-collimation mirror is scanned a small distance behind the lens <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, from an initial position <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to a final position <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. There exist a great variety of different configurations for the conjugates (object-point and image-point of the lens <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), which differ considerably in aspherical departure from the transmitted wave, which the lens adds to the impinging spherical wave. This can be used to minimize the aspherical departure and lead, therefore, to the highest measurement precision because the tolerances also for correctly adjusting the test set-up are lowered in that case. But, it is also possible to test the lens <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in a configuration similar to the one in which it is used later in an optical system. It can be stated that, in principle, the combination of a &ldquo;lens&plus;spherical auto-collimation mirror&rdquo; acts optically in similar way to an aspherical mirror. </paragraph>

The optical interface to further optics is by a cone of plane waves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which are produced by a collimating lens <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the ring-shaped aperture in its focus.

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is an arrangement in which a diverger <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, a lens <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> having positive power in transmission, and a spherical mirror <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be used to measure the aspherical wavefront of the lens <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> with conjugates optimized for minimal aspherical departures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In all the foregoing embodiments, it is possible to scan over the surface or wavefront in the radial direction by axially shifting one auto-collimation element. Together with this shift, the heterodyne frequency for the phase-measurement is delivered automatically. The coherence length of the light-source can be in all cases as small as the aspherical departure, and there is no need to adjust optical path length for the beams to make them interfere. Also, due to the nearly common path principle, the sensitivity against vibrations is reduced considerably, which is important for the realization of predictable monotonic and smooth phase-function in time. Also, the sensitivity to air-turbulence within the measuring volume is reduced because only air-gradients within this volume are harmful whereas, in the case of a Twyman-Green set up, the differences in both arms are harmful, and these are much bigger because of the smaller correlation of the air in both arms. Also, as is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, it is demonstrated that sensible ways for solving the measurement problems with a minimal air path always exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Three possibilities for calibrating test set-ups are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15, 16</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In these, the underlying concept is to scan a known aspherical surface in front of the de-collimator or diverging lens and to use this now known aspherical surface afterwards to assist in the measurement of an unknown aspherical surface. This way, the measurement is based ultimately on the surface of an a priori known asphere. The measurement procedure and the algorithm described with Eqs. (3) and (4) are only intermediate steps because the surfaces can not be compared in a direct manner to each other optically. The scanning-procedure acts as a &ldquo;transformer&rdquo; between the surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the final accuracy of the measurements is based on the quality with which a special aspherical surface, like a parabola, can be performed. It should be mentioned that the measurement of a parabola can be related to the measurement of a plane and a sphere, and both can be performed absolutely. Another candidate for calibration purposes is a hyperbola, which can be tested with the help of two spheres. Also, a lens in transmission together with a sphere for auto-collimation can be used. In addition, lenses exist which deliver a stigmatic wavefront in a special configuration (and can be tested with solely spherical wavefronts) and deliver a strong aspherical wavefront in a different configuration, which can be used for calibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Having described the embodiments and operation of the invention, variations will occur to others based on its teachings. Therefore, it is intended that all such variations be within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
