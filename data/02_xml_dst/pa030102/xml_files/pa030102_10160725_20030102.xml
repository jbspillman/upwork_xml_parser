<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an automated Bingo system having the ability to print sets of numbers on tickets on site. The system uses a computer to print the tickets, track the sale of the tickets and to validate winning tickets. In particular, the present invention relates to an automated system for playing Bingo where a computer stores the specific sets of Bingo numbers for a player and prints the tickets having the player&apos;s specific set of Bingo numbers to enable the player to play his specific Bingo numbers for various sessions of Bingo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The related art has shown various automated Bingo games where a computer is used to produce and track the game boards and to validate the winning game boards on site. Illustrative are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,007,649 to Richardson and 5,687,971 to Khaladkar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Richardson describes an automatic gaming system having a system base station, electronic gaming boards and validation units. The base station of the system includes a gaming library which contains a plurality of gaming cards created beforehand by the players. This allows the players to select the numbers on their cards. The gaming cards are downloaded from the base station into the electronic gaming boards. The base station retains auditing information about the downloaded cards. A validation code can also be downloaded into the electronic gaming boards. The electronic gaming boards can also have timers to prevent changing the gaming boards once the game has begun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Khaladkar describes a Bingo system using a computer to print Bingo cards on site and to track the sale of the cards. The system generates a fixed series of cards. The series needs to be fixed in order to keep track of the cards in the game. The system extracts from the data memory, a plurality of series of the Bingo cards which are different and separate and there is no duplication within a series or between series of the Bingo cards set forth in that series. The system uses a single paper for the entire book of Bingo cards to avoid possible tampering. Each Bingo card is associated with a serial number which identifies the particular Bingo card uniquely so that each Bingo card can be retrieved from the memory by entry into the memory of the serial number. The serial number on the card is used to verify the winner. Cards are preprinted before the game. The customer does not select numbers on the cards. The system can also be used with video display Bingo cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, of interest is U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,516 to Kolinskv which describes a computerized Bingo game where the computer plays all the Bingo cards simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Only of minimal interest is U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,432 to Rogaliner et al which describes a method of manufacturing Bingo paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> There remains the need for an automated Bingo system which allows players to select their own numbers and store their numbers in the automated system for use in later sessions of Bingo. The present invention allows for the printing of game tickets on site having the player&apos;s preselected sets of Bingo numbers and for tracking and validating the sets of numbers using the automated system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and system for managing a Bingo game. The method and system of the present invention allow repeat players to easily play their favorite sets of numbers in multiple sessions of Bingo. The method and system also allow the hall to track the sale of Bingo tickets, easily verify the Bingo winners and keep track of VIP or repeat players. The use of the computer with the accounting, ticket and receipt and the verification programs allows for on site, point-of-sale printing of tickets with minimal risk of tampering. The system enables players to store preselected Bingo numbers or sets of Bingo numbers in the memory or database of the computer. The Bingo numbers are then-able to be retrieved by a player when the player wishes to play the preselected Bingo numbers in a Bingo game. In the method of using the system, the VIP player preselects numbers which he wishes to play in multiple Bingo sessions. The hall enters the numbers into the memory of the computer. On the date of the Bingo game, the VIP player gives the hall his VIP player identification number. The hall enters the VIP player identification number into the computer and the VIP player&apos;s preselected numbers are displayed on the display of the computer. The VIP player then chooses which preselected Bingo numbers to play in the particular game. The VIP player pays for the Bingo numbers. The VIP player can pay for the numbers using VIP points which the player has accumulated from previous games. Upon paying for the numbers, the player is provided with a ticket. The ticket includes the preselected numbers with a control number for each set of numbers and a validation number for the ticket. The sets of numbers are printed on a ticket. The player has the option of also having the sets of numbers downloaded into an electronic Bingo device. The ticket can also be enlarged to a game board by the system at the player&apos;s option. The VIP player is also provided with a receipt indicating the number of preselected sets of numbers which the player bought, the validation number for the ticket and the time and date of the Bingo game for which the ticket is valid. The receipt may also list the sales agent and the identification number of the computer which sold the ticket. The Bingo game is then played with the called Bingo numbers being entered into the computer. When a player calls BINGO, the hall enters the control number of the potentially winning set of Bingo numbers into the computer. The computer will instantly notify the hall whether or not the player has a winning set of Bingo numbers. To collect his prize, the player must present his receipt having the correct validation number. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The automated Bingo system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention allows for managing all aspects of a Bingo game. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably can be used with any version of the game of Bingo. In the preferred embodiment, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used with a version of Bingo commonly referred to as &ldquo;U-PICK-EM&rdquo;, &ldquo;PICK 9&rdquo;, &ldquo;PICK 7&rdquo;, &ldquo;PICK 6&rdquo;, &ldquo;SELECT 8&rdquo;, &ldquo;PICK 8&rdquo; and &ldquo;DO IT YOURSELF&rdquo;. In this version of the game of Bingo, a player or the computer selects sets of numbers to be played in the game. Each set of numbers has the same amount of numbers. For example, for the game entitled &ldquo;PICK 7&rdquo;, all sets of numbers would have seven (7) numbers. The sets of numbers are displayed in horizontal rows. Preferably, the numbers range from 1 to 75; although, any range of numbers can be used. The hall or manager of the Bingo session calls the Bingo numbers in the range of numbers available for the particular game. Unlike standard Bingo, a letter in the word BINGO is not associated with the numbers. As the hall calls the numbers, the players mark their ticket or game boards. To win, a player must mark all numbers in a set of numbers which corresponds to marking one (1) horizontal row. In an alternative version of the &ldquo;UPICK-EM&rdquo; Bingo game, the hall has a second jackpot called a &ldquo;hot ball&rdquo;, &ldquo;fish bowl&rdquo;, &ldquo;pickle jar&rdquo; or &ldquo;cookie jar&rdquo;. To win this second jackpot, a player must achieve a winning Bingo configuration on a predetermined Bingo number as selected by the hall. Another alternative version of the &ldquo;U-PICK-EM&rdquo; Bingo game is the matrix option. In this version, a player or computer chooses the same number of sets of numbers as there are numbers in the set. For example, 5 sets of 5 numbers, 6 sets of 6 numbers, 7 sets of 7 numbers, etc. The sets are arranged in rows and columns with the number of rows equal to the number of columns. A player can win by marking all the numbers in either a row or column. For example, a ticket for a matrix version having <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> sets of 8 numbers would have 64 numbers with 16 sets of numbers in play allowing 16 different ways to achieve Bingo. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also allows for two (2) different types of Bingo players. The first type of player is a VIP or repeat player. A VIP player is a player who has played Bingo at the hall in the past and consistently plays Bingo at the hall. The second type of player is a general public player. A general public player is not a consistently, repeat player at the hall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention includes a computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a CPU <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a display or monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at least one (1) input/output device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a printer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A second computer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with a second printer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also be included in the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a computer memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a computer program <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A which allows for managing most aspects of the Bingo game. The computer program <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A is able to keep track of all the accounting involved in running a Bingo game, prepare the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the player and verify a winning set of Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a winning ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In particular, the computer program <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A includes an accounting program which keeps track of the number of sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> sold for a specific Bingo game as well as the amount of money or number of buying points paid for each set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The accounting program also allows for printing a receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for a player confirming the purchase of the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The accounting program is able to keep track of the amount. of money paid to various winners during each session. The accounting program also allows for special pricing of set(s) of numbers. For example, a player may receive a discount for purchasing multiple sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the accounting program used in the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is similar to the EPICS accounting program sold by Melange Computer Services, Inc. The computer program also includes a ticket program which prints tickets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> bought by the player at the point of sale. Alternatively, the ticket program downloads the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into a portable electronic Bingo device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the point of sale. Finally, the computer program includes a verification program. The verification program allows the hall to quickly and accurately verify that a ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a winning set of Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and that the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> was valid for the particular Bingo game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes a player database <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B having player files. The player files contain the favorite set or sets of Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which each VIP player likes to play for multiple sessions of the game of Bingo (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) If the player is a general public player, then the player does not have a player file. The sets of Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the player file are preselected by the player and are input into the player file. The player file is then given a player identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is given to the VIP player. The player identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be encoded on a magnetic strip on a VIP card (not shown). In the preferred embodiment, the preselected sets of Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are only entered once into the player database <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. In the preferred embodiment a VIP player is able to modify the preselected sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in a player file at any time. Preferably, the player database <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B can have an unlimited number of player files. In addition, preferably each player file has subfiles for each different version of the Bingo game. Thus, each subfile would include sets of Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which a VIP player has preselected to play in a specific version of the Bingo game. These subfiles are important where a hall plays several versions of Bingo. Preferably inactive player files which have not been accessed for a predetermined period of time are deleted from the player database <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. The memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes a temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C. The temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C includes the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> selected by a player for a specific session of Bingo. The temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C also includes the control numbers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the-validation numbers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relating to a specific session of Bingo. The temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C is preferably erased after each session of Bingo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> For a VIP player to use the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the VIP player swipes his player identification card through a reader at the cashier counter where the Bingo tickets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are sold (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Alternatively, the cashier or computer operator types the player identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the input/output device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is preferably a keyboard. The player&apos;s name may be inputted into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to obtain the player&apos;s identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The VIP player&apos;s player file is then displayed on the video display, video screen or monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the computer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the player&apos;s file contains subfiles then the player or cashier selects the subfile which corresponds to the version of the Bingo game which is to be played. The VIP player then selects the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> he wishes to play. In combination with the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> he selects, the VIP player can, also have the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> select random. sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the VIP player can choose to play only computer selected sets of random Bingo numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. For a general public player, to purchase sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for a Bingo game, the general public player indicates to the cashier how many sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> he wishes to play (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> then randomly picks the numbers for the number of sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to be purchased by the player. These sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prior to the player buying the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. It is possible that a player may request that the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reselect the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> if the player does not like the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> originally selected by the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If a general player would like to choose specific sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a player can start a player file directly prior to a game and become a VIP player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Once the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are selected, the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> assigns each set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> a unique control number <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>). If the game is a matrix game, the columns as well as the rows are provided with a control number <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The accounting program then calculates the cost of the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to be played by the player. The VIP player then pays for the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The VIP player can pay by cash or credit. In the preferred embodiment, the credit card information for a client is stored in the player file which eliminates the need for the player to produce a credit card. The player can also purchase sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> using buying points. Buying points are points earned by a player during previous games. The points result from a winning Bingo by a player. Alternatively, the player earns buying points based on the amount of sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> he purchases. Preferably, the accounting program calculates the total buying points a player has after each sale to a player and after each Bingo game, the total is then stored in the player&apos;s file in the player database <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the number of buying points a player has in his account is displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along with the preselected set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, when the VIP player identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is entered into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, a general public player can not purchase sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> using buying points since the player does not have a player file or an account to track his buying points. In addition, buying points are not awarded to general public players since there is no player file for those players. Once the VIP or general public player purchases the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> assigns the transaction or sale a single, unique validation number <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The player then receives a ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also stores the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> sold, the corresponding control numbers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the validation number <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C. The temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C preferably also includes the time and date of the particular session which the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are valid. In the preferred embodiment, the information for a particular session of Bingo is deleted from the temporary memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C after. a predetermined amount of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> issued to the player is printed on a printer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>). The printed ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is preferably the size of a standard store receipt. In addition, the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be downloaded into an electronic Bingo device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> preferably has a listing of the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to be played by the player. The sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are preferably arranged in horizontal rows. Each set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided with a unique transaction control number <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The unique control number <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for each set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably adjacent each row having the set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. For a matrix session, the control numbers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are preferably adjacent each row and at the top or bottom of each column. The ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also has the validation number <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for that ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or sale. In addition, the time and date of the game is indicated on the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If the player is a VIP player, the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also preferably includes the player&apos;s name or player identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. If the player is a general public player, then the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> preferably includes the words &ldquo;general public&rdquo; or includes a standard general public identification number. Once the sale is made and the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided to the player, the player may enter his identification number <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or the validation number <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> into a second computer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a second program memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with a second computer program. The second printer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> prints a large game sheet or game board <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</cross-reference>). The larger game board <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> preferably includes the same information as the original ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The larger game board <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> makes it easier for a player to mark his card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The player is also provided with a receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> preferably has the validation number <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the amount of sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> purchased, the session of the game for which the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> were purchased, the total value of the sales of the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the amount due, amount received and change due for the sale (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>). The receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also preferably includes the date and time the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> were purchased, the name of the hall having the Bingo game, the identification of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which sold the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the identification of the operator of the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the player is a VIP player, the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may also include a buying point transaction accounting including the buying point total, the points redeemed, points earned, the new point total and the dollar value of the points (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, only one (1) Bingo game is on sale at one time. However, it is possible that multiple Bingo games could be sold at the same time. Preferably, all sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for a particular game must be purchased the day of the game. The sales of sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for a particular session of Bingo are preferably stopped 5 minutes before the start of the game. This prevents players from selecting sets having numbers which have already been called. In an alternative embodiment, the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> must be purchased directly before the-game. In the preferred embodiment, the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> keeps track of only one game and the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for that game. Preferably, the sets of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for a specific game would be printed on a single ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with a corresponding separate receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;U-PICK-EM&rdquo; Bingo game is preferably played similarly to standard Bingo games (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). The hall randomly selects numbers and calls the numbers. Any well known means can be used to select the numbers. In the preferred embodiment, the selection of numbers and calling of numbers is not done using the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may automatically enter the Bingo numbers as they are selected or called. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can use a ball call interface to automatically enter the winning Bingo numbers into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A ball call- interface is a device that reads the Bingo numbers once they are called and placed into the ball call blower rack. Alternatively, the Bingo numbers can be manually entered into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As the numbers are called, each player marks their ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, game board <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or electronic Bingo device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> appropriately. When a player or players have covered all of the numbers of a set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the player signals a Bingo. Alternatively, where the game is a matrix game, the player would signal when all the numbers in either a row or column on the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is covered. Therefore in a matrix game, a winning set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may not be a set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> selected by a player but rather include a single number for each set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> selected by a player. When a player signals a Bingo, the player shows his ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the hall. The hall enters the control number <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> forming the winning Bingo into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> compares the player&apos;s set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with the called numbers. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> then indicates whether the set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> was sold for that particular session and whether the set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a winning set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. If the set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is verified as a winning set, the set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably displayed on monitors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the hall so that the remaining players can see the winning set of numbers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. To collect a winning jackpot, the player must show his original receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the hall. The hall compares the validation numbers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the receipt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to confirm that the ticket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> was purchased for that particular session. </paragraph>
