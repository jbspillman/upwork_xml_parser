<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to chip stacks, and more particularly to a chip stack which is uniquely configured to provide a JEDEC Standard TSOP II <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> interface footprint combined with a fine pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) &ldquo;bump&rdquo; to increase I/O interconnection capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is currently known in the art, packaged components are often stacked using a variety of approaches. In all of the approaches to date, the concept has been for the end user to mount the stacks on the surface of a solid board such as a printed circuit board (PCB). More particularly, one of the most commonly used techniques to increase memory capacity is the stacking of memory devices into a vertical chip stack, sometimes referred to as 3D packaging or Z-Stacking. In the Z-Stacking process, from two to as many as eight memory devices or other integrated circuit (IC) chips are interconnected in a single component (i.e., a chip stack) which is mountable to the &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; typically used for a single packaged device such as a packaged chip. The Z-Stacking process has been found to be volumetrically efficient, with packaged chips in TSOP (thin small outline package) or LCC (leadless chip carrier) form generally being considered to be the easiest to use in relation thereto. Though bare dies may also be used in the Z-Stacking process, such use tends to make the stacking process more complex and not well suited to automation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With particular regard to chip stacks formed by stacking TSOP packaged chips, the typical interface footprint included on a PCB to accommodate such a chip stack is commonly referred to as a JEDEC Standard TSOP II <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> interface footprint. However, because this particular interface footprint has a prescribed, limited number of I/O interconnection points, it is often desirable to provide a secondary footprint of additional I/O interconnection points on the PCB or other substrate adjacent to such primary interface footprint. One deficiency of chip stacks known in the prior art is the absence of any structures which are particularly adapted to facilitate the appropriate electrical connection of the chip stack to such secondary footprint. The present invention addresses this shortcoming by providing a chip stack providing a JEDEC Standard TSOP II <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> interface footprint combined with a fine pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) &ldquo;bump&rdquo; specifically adapted for interface to the secondary footprint. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a chip stack comprising at least two chip packages. Each of the chip packages comprises a packaged chip including a body defining an opposed pair of sides and having a plurality of leads extending outwardly from each of the opposed sides thereof. Each chip package further comprises a pair of rails which extend along respective ones of the opposed sides of the body. Each of the rails defines opposed top and bottom surfaces and includes top inner and outer pads disposed on the top surface and bottom inner and outer pads disposed on the bottom surface. A plurality of conductive bumps are formed on respective ones of the top outer pads of each of the rails of one of the chip packages. In the chip stack, the chip packages are electrically connected to each other via the electrical connection of the leads of the packaged chip of one of the chip packages to respective ones of the bottom inner pads of the rails of the remaining one of the chip packages which include the conductive bumps formed on respective ones of the top outer pads thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the chip stack of the present invention, each of the top inner pads and each of the rails is electrically connected to a respective one of the bottom inner pads thereof. Similarly, each of the top outer pads of each of the rails is electrically connected to a respective one of the bottom outer pads thereof. At least one of the top outer pads of at least one of the rails of one of the chip packages is electrically connected to a respective one of the bottom outer pads of at least one of the rails of the remaining one of the chip packages via a solder column which may be fabricated from a noneutectic soldering material. The solder column(s) may be electrically insulated from the top inner pads and the bottom inner pads of each of the rails, or may alternatively be electrically connected to at least one of the top and bottom inner pads of at least one of the rails.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the present invention is directed to a chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises at least two (2) identically configured chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which are stacked upon and electrically connected to each other in a manner which will be described in more detail below. Each of the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a leaded packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a TSOP (thin small outline package) device including a rectangularly configured body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defining generally planar top and bottom surfaces, and opposed pairs of longitudinal and lateral sides. Extending from each of the longitudinal sides of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are a plurality of conductive leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each preferably have a gull-wing configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition to the packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, each of the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of elongate, rectangularly configured substrates or rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which extend along respective ones of the longitudinal sides of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in spaced relation thereto. The rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each define opposed, generally planar top and bottom surfaces. Disposed on the top surface of each of the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are a multiplicity of top inner conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which extend linearly in spaced relation to each other. Similarly, disposed on the bottom surface of each of the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are a multiplicity of bottom inner conductive pads which are arranged in the same pattern as and are preferably aligned with respective ones of the top inner conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the same rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the top inner conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of each rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to respective ones of the corresponding bottom inner conductive pads of the same rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the use of vias which extend through the rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, conductive traces which extend exteriorly about the inner surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition to the top inner conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, each of the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of each chip package <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of top outer conductive pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which also extend linearly in spaced relation to each other. Disposed on the bottom surface of each rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a plurality of bottom outer conductive pads which are arranged in the same pattern as and are preferably aligned with respective ones of the top outer conductive pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the same rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the top outer conductive pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of each rail are electrically connected to respective ones of the bottom outer conductive pads of the same rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the use of either vias or conductive traces which extend exteriorly about the outer surface of the rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In assembling each of the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of each packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to respective ones of the top inner conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a corresponding pair of rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such electrical connection is preferably accomplished through the use of Sn96 non-eutectic solder. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the assembly of the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thereafter accomplished by stacking and electrically connecting the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to each other. When stacked, the leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of one of the packaged chips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are captured or sandwiched between the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of one of the packaged chips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in addition to being electrically connected to respective ones of the top inner connective pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the corresponding pair of rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, are also electrically connected to respective ones of the bottom inner conductive pads of the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the other chip package <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Again, such electrical connection is preferably accomplished through the use of Sn96 non-eutectic solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As further seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the top outer conductive pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of one of the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are themselves electrically connected to respective ones of the bottom outer conductive pads of the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the remaining chip package <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the use of a solder bump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, itself preferably formed of Sn96 non-eutectic solder. A solder bump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also formed on each of the top outer conductive pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of one of the chip packages <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and more particularly on that chip package <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wherein the leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the corresponding packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are not captured between the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such solder bump(s) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is/are preferably formed having a height which is substantially coplanar to the distal ends of the leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the corresponding packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> electrically connected to the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the leads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the packaged chip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are exposed define a JEDEC Standard TSOP II <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> interface footprint. The adjacent exposed bumps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> themselves create a supplemental fine pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) footprint. These primary and secondary footprints can be used to establish a desired electrical connection between the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a PCB or other substrate including corresponding primary and secondary interface footprints as described above. The electrical interconnection between the secondary fine pitch Ball Grid Array interface footprint can be used to establish a discreet electrical connection to any lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of any one of packaged chips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, bypassing the other packaged chip(s) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the top outer conductive pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and/or bottom outer conductive pads of any chip package <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be electrically connected to one or more of the top inner conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and/or one or more of the bottom inner conductive pads of another chip package <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the use of exterior conductive traces or internal vias. As an alternative to being used to establish a discreet electrical connection to one of the packaged chips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the electrical interconnection achieved by the solder bumps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can also be used to establish a discreet electrical connection to a component separate from the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the chip stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
