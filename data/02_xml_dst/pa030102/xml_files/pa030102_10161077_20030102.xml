<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The current source of the embodiment consists of a bandgap circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has a first NPN bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a base connected in common to that of a second NPN bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The first bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a greater effective width that the second transistor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, for example five times greater. The effect is that for a similar base-emitter potential the first transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will conduct more current than the second transistor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The emitter of the first transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the emitter of the second transistor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> via a resistance <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the emitter of the second transistor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is connected to a reference potential VEE via a resistance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The collectors of the first <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> NPN transistors are connected to a positive supply rail Vcc via a current mirror <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> composed of PNP transistors <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The second NPN transistor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has its collector connected to the positive supply rail Vcc via a diode-connected PNP transistor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which has its base connection in common with a controlled PNP transistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> serving to connect the collector of the first NPN transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the positive supply rail Vcc. The collector of the first NPN transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is further connected to the base of a first amplifying PNP transistor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which has an emitter connected to the positive supply rail and a collector connected to a second current mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The second current mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a first NPN transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is diode-connected, and which has an emitter connected to the reference rail VEE. The base of transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is connected in common to the base of a controlled NPN transistor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, with emitter connected to the reference rail VEE and with a collector connected to a diode-connected PNP transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the emitter of transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> connected to the positive supply rail. Together the transistors <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> form a current amplification circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. To provide current gain the first amplifying transistor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is wider than the controlled transistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first current mirror <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, for example twice as wide. In the preferred embodiment transistors <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are of the same size as transistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The collector of transistor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is also connected to the base of a sensing transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, being a PNP transistor having its emitter connected to the positive supply rail Vcc. The collector of transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the reference rail VEE via a feedback resistor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between the transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> being connected to the commoned bases of the first and second NPN transistors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In operation the bandgap circuit, being connected in a loop including the current amplifier and the feedback resistor, provides a constant potential at the node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The constant potential at node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is produced by virtue of a constant current through the sensing transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the base potential of the sensing transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thus such as to give rise to this constant current. The base potential is fed to three output PNP transistors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each of which has a respective emitter connected to the positive supply rail and a respective collector forming an output node <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In the embodiments shown transistor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are each twice the width of transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and transistor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is four times the width of transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As a result output terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> each produce a magnitude of current double that of the current through transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whereas the node <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> produces a current four times the magnitude of the current through transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The current source circuit has a high power supply rejection, defined as the amount of variation of power supply voltage which appears in the output current. The power supply rejection at the output, which depends upon the power supply rejection at node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the ratio of the output resistance of the sensing transistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the feedback resistance <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> divided by the loop gain of the circuit. Given that the node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in the feedback loop and given the gain of the loop including the current amplifying circuit a theoretical value of power supply rejection of minus 78 dB may be achieved in embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The circuit so far defined is unlikely to be self-starting. To achieve self-starting it is necessary to cause the bandgap circuit I to start to conduct. To achieve this an NPN emitter follower transistor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has its emitter connected to the commoned bases of the first and second NPN transistors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The collector of the emitter follower <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to the positive supply rail Vcc and the base is connected to the positive supply rail Vcc via a resistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The base is further connected to the reference rail VEE via the series connection of two diode-connected NPN transistors <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. A switch in the form of an N-FET <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has its main current path connected between the base of emitter follower transistor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the reference supply rail VEE and the FET has a gate connection to the output of a CMOS inverter having a P-type pull-up transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and an N-type pull-down transistor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The gates of the transistors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are connected in common to a control terminal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is also connected to a P-type transistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having its main current path between the positive supply rail Vcc and the collector of the second NPN transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The operation of the start-up circuitry will now be described: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When the control terminal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is at a high potential the gate of the switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is at a low potential and therefore the switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> remains non-conducting. In this situation current flows through the resistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the series connection of the diodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B causing a base potential on the emitter follower <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of two diode voltages above the reference potential. Hence the emitter of the emitter follower <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will have a potential of one diode voltage above the reference potential and this value is fed to the commoned gates of the first and second NPN transistors of the bandgap circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, this potential being sufficient to start the bandgap. Once the bandgap loop is operational the potential at the node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is higher than one diode potential above the reference rail and as a result the emitter follower <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> plays no part in the normal operating mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The P-type transistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> constitutes a control for turning off the current source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> During the start-up condition the high potential at the control terminal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> maintains the P-transistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> off, therefore not affecting operation of the bandgap. When however the potential at the control terminal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> falls towards the reference level, the P-type transistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> turns on and pulls the collector of the second NPN transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bandgap towards the positive supply potential. This in turn causes the current amplifying transistor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to turn off and turns off the bandgap loop. At the same time the low potential at control terminal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is supplied to the inverter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the N-type switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> turns on shorting out the diodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and reducing the base voltage of the emitter follower <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to substantially zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The constant current circuit described produces a constant current output over temperature and supply voltage. It is turned on and off easily and the control circuitry for starting and stopping operation has no substantial effect on operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> All of the above U.S. patents, U.S. patent application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and/or listed in the Application Data Sheet, U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,174 are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>
