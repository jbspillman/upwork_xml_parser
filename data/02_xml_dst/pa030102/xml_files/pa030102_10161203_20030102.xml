<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing thermoplastic panels for use in automobiles and other applications. This application claims priority of U.S. Application Serial No. 60/295,112, filed Jun. 1, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various types of automotive panels, including interior panels such as rear shelf panels, inner door panels, etc., are usually either molded in a single layer with ribs or are assembled to a second layer to gain structural strength and/or acoustic properties desired. For interior trim panels, typical layers may include a relatively rigid panel for strength, a decorative layer (with a carpeting, fabric or vinyl exposed surface), a core panel of foam or other light weight construction to help with rigidizing and/or soundproofing, a back panel for added sound-proofing, and a barrier sandwich. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These panels are typically formed by injection molding a thermoplastic material directly into a mold or by sheet molding, which comprises inserting previously-manufactured sheeting of thermoplastic material into a mold. The mold also can contain one or more layers of other laminate materials, such as a decorative layer. The molds are typically mounted so that they translate only along one axis, to move to an open and closed position. Once the sheeting of material are placed in the mold the mold is then closed, distributing the thermoplastic material throughout the contours of the cavity, and thus forming the panel. Where additional layers are included, they are typically laminated to the thermoplastic material as part of the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as described in the present invention, such panels could be manufactured using a blow-molding or vacuum forming process. In blow-molding processes, a thermoplastic form, called a parison, is typically placed in the mold, the mold closed, and then air or some other gaseous medium is injected into the parison by the use of nozzles that have been inserted into the parison. The formed part then cools in the mold, and maintains the shape of the mold once the die halves are retracted and the part removed. Vacuum forming, similarly, uses ports formed in the mold to exhaust the air and draw plastic into the contours of the mold cavity. As with other molding processes, however, the die halves used in blow molding or vacuum forming are typically mounted to that they translate only along one axis, to move to an open and closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With each of these types of molding processes, a recurring problem is how to transport materials into the mold in an economical and efficient manner, including not only the thermoplastic material used in molding, but also additional layers such as decorative layers and rigidizing or soundproofing layers. Moreover, in a typical molding process, the mold is placed at or near the thermoplastic material delivery components. Thus, the thermoplastic delivery stations must deliver thermoplastic material only intermittently, sitting idle while the mold is going through a cooling cycle. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide for economical and efficient transport of materials into the mold and to reduce idle time for thermoplastic delivery stations in a molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, adequate distribution of thermoplastic material throughout the mold is essential for a good quality automotive panel. This could present particular problems for blow-molding processes, as the path to the contours of the mold cavity may be obstructed by laminating layers, such as a decorative layers, foam cores, etc. and can cause significant wrinkling in the product as it is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention, therefore, to provide a process that provides good distribution of thermoplastic material through a mold cavity without wrinkling of the product. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With the method of the present invention, parts are made in molds which are mounted on a frame which slowly rotates under one or more of extrusion dies or other thermoplastic sheet delivery components that deliver hot sheet to the open tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Prior to sheet delivery, the tool forming the desired top appearance of the part may have covering material such as carpet inserted in it, and the bottom tool may have any desired fastening brackets and adhesively compatible sound absorber or barrier material inserted in it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> After sheet delivery any desired compatible core insert may be placed in either tool, before or after blow molding or vacuum forming (if chosen) but before the molds hinge closed and are clamped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Forming may be aided by closing on an inserted core or by applying a blowing pressure through a nozzle which penetrates to the inside of the part or by vacuum forming. After further rotation and cooling to rigidize the part, the mold clamping means is released and they are again opened flat to allow part removal and repeating of the cycle.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the thermoplastic molding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention comprises one or more thermoplastic material delivery stations <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, two or more hinged clam shell molds <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted on rotating frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is composed of a mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that are connected by hinge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Hinge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may or may not be exposed. The mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of each clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is affixed at each station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b, c </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on rotating frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> hinges from an open position, as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to a closed position on the mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the position of the hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in its closed position at stations <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Both the mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have concave depressions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in their inner faces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that they form a mold cavity when rotated to a closed position on hinge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In the open position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the inner face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the inner face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are approximately co-planar, and facing in the same direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic material delivery station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> typically delivers hot sheets or sheeting of thermoplastic material to die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, when die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in the open position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In a preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic material delivery station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises two separate extruders <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, each extruder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> delivering freshly extruded thermoplastic sheets or sheeting to a respective die half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Optionally, thermoplastic molding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a decorative layer unroll station <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which delivers a sheet of carpet or some other decorative layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to one or more of the mold halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> prior to delivery of the thermoplastic sheet. The decorative layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is typically positioned on the die half that forms the desired top appearance of the part. The die half that forms the bottom half of the part may have any desired fastening brackets and adhesively compatible sound absorber or barrier material inserted in it by similar means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In operation, the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> slowly rotates past one or more thermoplastic material delivery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> components. When the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> approaches the position shown as station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is in an open position, the inner face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the inner face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are approximately co-planar, and are facing in the same direction. Decorative layer unroll station <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> lays down a decorative layer over one or both die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as the die halves move past the decorative layer unroll station <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the rotating frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotates by the thermoplastic material delivery component(s) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, towards the position shown as station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> remains in an open position, and the thermoplastic material delivery component(s) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> lay down a thermoplastic layer over one or more W of die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Once the clam shell mold rotates on frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the position shown as station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a compatible core insert, if desired, can be placed on any material in either die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The core insert may placed from the front or back of the machine on a reciprocating rack with pins that hold the insert. The core insert can be made of any appropriate material, including structural foam, compatible thermoplastic foam, thermoplastic honeycomb core or soundproofing/acoustic foam. The core insert may also serve to assist with rigidizing the part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has rotated past the thermoplastic material delivery station, the hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates on hinge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a closed position on the mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is clamped by any conventional means. Decorative layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the thermoplastic sheets may be cut by any conventional means, including by sharp edges on the inner faces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, by heat applied at the appropriate point on the die halves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> If desired, where multiple layers of thermoplastic material are used, the multiple layers can be perimeter sealed to form an interior bladder as the hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates to the closed position on mounted die half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and nozzles can be inserted between the layers of thermoplastic material to aid in forming the part. Where such nozzles are used, gaseous medium is introduced through the nozzles between layers of thermoplastic material once the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in its closed position and has been clamped. Applying a gaseous medium through the nozzle(s) expands the bladder outward against the outer contour surfaces of the mold formed by the depressions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if desired, vacuum forming can be used to assist in forming the part by placing ports within the walls of the die halves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The perimeter seal may be formed by pressing the thermoplastic material together and using the integral heat of the thermoplastic material to complete the seal. Alternatively, additional thermoplastic heating can be applied before or after the die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> close. Adhesives may also be applied before the die halves close to form the perimeter seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotates to the positions shown as station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the part cools, thus rigidizing in the shape of the depressions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in die halves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Once the clam shell mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reaches the position shown as station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, any gaseous medium (in the case of blow molding) or vacuum (in the case of vacuum forming) is released, the hinged die half <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is unclamped and rotated on hinge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the open position, and the formed part removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, thermoplastic material delivery station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of two extruders and a die. Optionally, the thermoplastic material may be calendared through two hot rollers producing sheets, and through additional hot rollers to produce the desired thickness. Thus, the thermoplastic material can be formed into a part, along with any additional layers or inserted cores, by any molding means, including blow molding, vacuum forming, or sheet molding. Alternatively, the thermoplastic material delivery station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can comprise a single extruder delivering a single, much wider sheet over both die halves at the same time to perform these same molding processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, top and bottom materials being extruded may be different grades of thermoplastic and different filler levels for achieving best part performance and economics. If the different materials are not compatible for thermoplastic bonding with their own heat, a bonding adhesive may be applied to the intended bond surface before molds are closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the thermoplastic material delivery station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can deliver other types of thermoplastic sheets, such as a heated flax/polypropylene moldable mat, as one or more thermoplastic layer(s) of part construction. Such flax/polypropylene mats are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,285. A flax/polypropylene mat may be delivered to both die halves, or to only one die half. Where blow molding is to be used, and only one flax/polypropylene mat is delivered, an extruded sheet delivered to the remaining die half and perimeter sealed to the flax/polypropylene mat to form the internal bladder. In the event that the flax/polypropylene mat is delivered to only one die half, it may be preferable to deliver the flax/polypropylene moldable mat to the mounted die half as on top of the carpet. Such choices are dependent solely upon the particular end-part properties desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Delivery of the flax/polypropylene introduction of the flax/polypropylene moldable mat may be performed by providing a roll unwind station, similar to decorative layer unroll station <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As the material is being introduced into a mold, the flax/polypropylene moldable mat is heated by a set of hot plates or by contact with hot rollers just before the mold entry point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to interior trim panels, but can be applied equally well to any other types of panels, such as other automotive panels and to non-automotive applications in the office furniture and building trade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiment utilizes a clam shell mold construction, other shaped molds that can be used on a rotating frame may be without departing from the scope of this invention. Similarly, other rotating frames may be used, such as a turntable as opposed to a wheel, without departing from the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that modifications and changes can be made without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention, as defined by the following claims which are to be interpreted and understood in view of the foregoing. </paragraph>
