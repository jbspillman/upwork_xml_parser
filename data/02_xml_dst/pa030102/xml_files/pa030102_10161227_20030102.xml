<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to elevator installations having at least two elevator groups and a method for the selection of the most favorable elevator to serve a hall call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There is shown in the European patent specification EP 0 891 291 B1 a multi-group control for several elevator groups with destination call control and immediate allocation, in which the destination call input is undertaken inter alia at any call registration device, which is not assigned to a specific elevator group, and the allocated elevator can be made indicated in clear and simple manner. By immediate allocation it is to be understood that the most favorable elevator is immediately allocated to the passenger destination call. The passenger thus does not need to know the division of the building into floor regions that are served only by individual elevator groups. The passenger is informed at an optimal time by visual and acoustic instructions in the elevator car about the next connection leading to the destination floor. There is no precise method indicated exactly how the known multi-group control selects the most favorable elevator when the travel between the start floor and the destination floor is provided with changeovers. At the same time, also no method is indicated how the multi-group control can select the most favorable route when several routes lead to the destination floor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a method for the selection of the most favorable elevator to serve a hall call in elevator installations having at least two elevator groups and which indicates a precise procedure how the most favorable elevator can be selected when the passenger has to make a change in cars between the start floor and the destination floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that the most optimal elevator cars in terms of costs from the start to the destination are selected. The passenger is thus taken to the destination floor as quickly as possible without loss of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the elevator groups each comprise a corresponding group control. This has the advantage that each elevator group can be controlled automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each group control comprises a destination call control with immediate allocation. This has the advantage that in each elevator group the best elevator of the group always can be selected. The early recognition of the destination floor makes it possible to undertake the selection from the elevator cars that can serve the destination floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, the group controls of all the elevator groups are connected into a central multi-group control (MGS). This has the advantage that the selection from all elevators in question can take place automatically from a central unit, particularly when the zones served by several elevator groups intersect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, several routes are available for reaching the destination floor from the start floor, wherein the most favorable route is ascertained. This has the advantage that the problem arising with elevator groups, namely several possible routes with changeovers, can be solved. The optimal and quickest route from the start to the destination is thus selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> All explained features are usable not only in the respectively indicated combination, but also in other combinations or by themselves without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Different embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the schematic drawings and explained in more detail in the following description.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The passenger in the lobby or, however, at any floor inputs the destination floor at one of the multi-group terminals. A central multi-group control MGS (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) compares the desired journey with a data bank DB or a journey array in order to establish whether the desired destination floor can be achieved only by one route, also termed line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the case of only one possibility of reaching the destination floor by one or several changeovers, the selection of the line is no problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If there are several routes&mdash;for example, Journey 1: high-rise shuttle with one group and then, after changeover, travel downwards with a elevator of another group, or Journey 2: low-rise shuttle with one group and, after changeover, travel upwards with a elevator of another group&mdash;there is initially selected the most likely shortest route, in terms of time, to the destination on the basis of statistical values and the instantaneous travel situation. After selection of the best line, the extended journey is broken down into individual stretches or parts which can usually be served by different elevator groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If one of the part travels can be dealt with by any of several elevator groups, a multi-group control functions (as, for example, according to patent EP 0 891 291 B1) in order to determine the first elevator to be used. In the case of only one elevator group, this multi-group control determines the best elevator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The first elevator to be used is thus evaluated and communicated on the terminal display to the passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> During the journey, the central multi-group control MGS tracks the course over time of the elevator travel with respect to arrival at the changeover floor. As soon as the approach time to the changeover floor is fixed (no more intermediate stops possible), the evaluation of the best elevator of the next group for the second journey part begins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As soon as the next, best elevator is selected, the passenger in the car can be informed. The next elevator to be used to each destination floor, the attainment of which is possible only by elevator car changeovers, is indicated on a car information system or other display. At the same time the audio announcing system is actuated. This instruction can also be combined for several destination floors and/or connecting elevators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Some advantages of this solution are indicated in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The central multi-group control MGS selects the optimal route from the start floor to the destination floor, divides the selected line up into individual part journeys, i.e. elevator groups, which select the best elevator only for the most optimal moment and, in particular, on the basis of the precisely established remaining travel time in the previously used elevator, the alighting time, the path for walking over between two successively used elevators, the approach time of the elevator, which is soon to be used, for the changeover floor and all other factors which are used in a known multi-group control (such as, for example, according to patent EP 0 891 291 B1) for determining the best elevator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The passenger is optically and acoustically informed about the next connection at the earliest possible moment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An immediate allocation takes place, i.e. the passenger is allocated a car immediately after the destination call input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The passenger does not have to carry a device giving directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows, as example, four group controls GR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, GR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, GR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and GR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which correspondingly have group-control computers GR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PC, GR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-PC, GR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-PC and GR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-PC. The group controls GR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, GR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, GR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and GR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are combined by way of the group control computers GR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PC, GR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-PC, GR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-PC and GR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-PC in common into the central multi-group control MGS, which comprises the data bank DB and a multi-group control computer MG-PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The flowcharts of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are described in more detail in the following, wherein the flowcharts in this example are, for the sake of simplicity, shown only up to the third stretch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The method starts with a step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> wherein passenger inputs from the starting floor S a new destination call to the destination floor Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The central multi-group control MGS compares, in a step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the desired journey with the data bank for a journey array DB in order to establish whether the desired destination floor can be reached by way of one route or by way of several routes W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . .

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Case A): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> If several routes from the start story S to the destination floor Z exist, then the method follows a yes branch &ldquo;Y&rdquo; to a step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> wherein a first route W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is divided into stretches W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>Tn, wherein &ldquo;n&rdquo; is an integral number.

The elevator operating costs of the respective paths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , WTn; W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>Tn and WnT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, WnT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , WnTn are now compared in the multi-group control computer MG-PC of the central multi-group control MGS and the favorite route FW is ascertained in a step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The elevator is allocated in steps <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the group control computer which is to control the first stretch and cancellation of the order is caused in a step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at the remaining group control computers which do not have the first stretch of the favorite route FW. Cancellation of the order is caused in a step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the remaining group control computers which do not have the second stretch of the favorite route FW and cancellation of the order is caused for further stretches such as in a step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at the remaining group control computers which do not have the final &ldquo;n&rdquo; stretch of the favorite route FW. Travel over the first stretch S-U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the start floor S to the first changeover floor U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then undertaken in a step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As soon as it is established that no more intermediate stops are possible, the multi-group control computer MG-PC is informed in a step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that the changeover floor U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the next destination. In the same manner, the elevator allocation is then made in steps <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the selected elevator group at which the second stretch from the first changeover floor U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the destination floor Z (U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Z) or to the second changeover floor U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is carried out. If the destination floor Z lies at the end of the second stretch, a yes branch &ldquo;Y&rdquo; from a step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, then the second stretch U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Z is traveled in a step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the passenger has reached his destination in a step <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. If the destination floor Z does not lie at the end of the second stretch, a no branch &ldquo;N&rdquo; in the step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, then the second stretch U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is traveled in a step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the same procedure is used for the further stretches in order to reach the destination floor Z. In this example, the procedure is shown up to the third stretch in steps <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>; the same procedure can obviously be used for the further stretches. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If only a single route W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the start floor S to the destination floor Z exists and a changeover is necessary, yes branch &ldquo;Y&rdquo; at the step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, then this route W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is broken down into stretches W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>Tn in a step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and in the same manner as above the elevator allocation for the first stretch from the start floor S to the first changeover floor U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out in steps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As soon as the first stretch has been traveled in a step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the same procedure is then used for the remaining stretches as is used in &ldquo;Case A)&rdquo; from the changeover floor U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in steps <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>.
