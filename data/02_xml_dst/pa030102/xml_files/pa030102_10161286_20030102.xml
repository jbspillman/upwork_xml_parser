<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A laminator for laminating sheets of lamina onto substrates such as cards uses a web of lamina material that preferably has a bondable and printable layer on the reverse side and can then be printed with information and laminated onto a blank card. The web also preferably has a series of spaced transverse lines of reduced strength so the web can be separated into individual sheets of lamina by creating a tension in the web across the transverse line of reduced strength. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for bonding a heat bondable lamina onto a card that forms a substrate. The lamina is separable into sheets that fit the cards closely. Informational materials can be printed either on the cards or on the lamina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Laminated cards are widely used as drivers licenses, identification cards, and other types of cards on which information is printed, and then a lamina is placed over the card to protect the printing. Particularly, a card shaped substrate is made from a suitable material such as a plastic, cardboard or the like, and information such as photographs, personal data, text and graphics are required to be carried on the card so that it can be used for identification easily. In some instances, holographic images and other optical or magnetically stored information will be present on the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present device permits selectively utilizing a lamina that is provided from a web on supply roll and which can be separated into sections without cutting. The lamina is made so printing can be applied to the reverse side of the lamina, if desired, and then laminated onto a face of a card or substrate. Alternately, the card may be preprinted and the lamina bonded into place with a heat sensitive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another problem that has arisen in the use of laminated cards is the ability to lift the plastic lamina from the substrate and alter or change the printed information and then subsequently replace the lamina after the alteration has been completed. In order to obviate that, it is important that the edges of the lamina do not protrude from the card at any place, unlike the square corner of standard lamina used on the rounded corners of standard substrates as cards. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides apparatus and methods for placing lamina onto a substrate, such as a card, and heat bonding the lamina in place with little waste of lamina material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one preferred form, the lamina is constructed with a printable vinyl layer that will be placed to overlie the substrate and used for heat bonding to the substrate. Since a vinyl layer also can carry printed material, printing may be applied to the reverse or inner side of the lamina, and then the lamina will be bonded to a card that has no printing. The lamina may be provided as an elongated web on a supply roll, and then separated into individual substrate sized sheets. The sheets are brought into registry with the substrates or cards and heat bonded in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further preferred embodiment utilizes a roll having a web of lamina material from which the successive of sheets are separated from each other along micro perforated lines or equivalent that extend transversely to the length of the web. Scallops are formed at intervals along the edges of the web and aligning scallops are joined by the micro perforated lines so that by placing a snap-load on the web visually smooth end edges are formed for the individual lamina sheets. The scalloped portions along the edges of the roll of material are rounded to conform to the corners of the cards or substrates. The lamina sheets are precisely sized and configured to the corners of the substrates or cards, so that the lamina can be of size to cover the entire area of the card with no edges of the lamina extending beyond the card at the rounded corners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this preferred embodiment, the printing can take place on a reverse side of the lamina, or the cards can be preprinted and then covered with the lamina sheets. The sheets are separated without cutting, but by exerting a tensile load across the microperforations which form a reduced strength line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In all forms of the apparatus, the lamina can be multiple layered and include a polyester outer layer, and a layer of material such as a holographic imaging system layer bonded to the polyester layer in a known manner, and then a layer of vinyl bonded to the holographic image layer. The vinyl can be printed upon, and is on the reverse side, of the laminate so it also is bonded to the core or substrate forming the card. If the reverse side of the laminate carries the needed printing, the card or substrate can be blank. Alternatively, a vinyl layer may be used and printed upon on the reverse side and bonded directly to a card or substrate without using a polyester layer or a holographic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The apparatus shown accurately places the laminate sheets onto the cards. The web is either easily separated into sheet segments with the printing either on the reverse side of the lamina or on the card, depending on the configuration of the apparatus desired.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, box <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is a step of providing a web of lamina material on a roll with a heat sensitive layer on its reverse side, that is the side that would not be exposed when the lamina material is laminated to a substrate. The web of lamina is moved from the roll through a printer for printing on the reverse side of the lamina represented at <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The layer of the web that is heat sensitive also is a layer that can be printed upon. Then, the lamina is separated into sheets, at step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The apparatus is used to guide and the individual sheet segments to mate with a card as indicated at step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and the substrate or card, and the lamina sheet are laminated in place using heat as indicated by step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the card can be printed as indicated by the step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and in which instance, the lamina can be provided without printing, as indicated by the step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The lamina web would be merely separated into the card size sheets and mated with the preprinted card at step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and laminated in place at step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows details of the separating step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to separate the web from a roll into individual lamina sheets, without using a cutter. As shown at step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the lamina is provided with weakened or reduced strength cross lines, preferably microperforations, aligned with notches or scallops at the edges of the web. Then the web is driven in a first set of drive or pinch rollers that will drive the lamina web from the supply roll as indicated at <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The lamina web, before separating the sheets, is received by a second set of pinch or drive rollers with the reduced strength or weakened transverse line across the lamina web between the first and second sets of pinch rollers as indicated in step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and then as indicated at <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, a differential in speed between the first and second sets of rollers is provided to introduce tension in the lamina material that is sufficient to separate the sheets from the roll supply across the weakened portion or perforated portion. The tension preferably is a &ldquo;snap&rdquo; or sudden tension load. This can be done by providing a sudden stop to the trailing set of rollers, or a sudden acceleration to the leading rollers provides a &ldquo;snap&rdquo; action, or in other ways. This avoids the need for providing a cutter or a cutting mechanism of any sort. Microperforations for the line of reduced strength leave a smooth edge that makes the sheets easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to illustrate the reduced strength transverse cross lines, a supply roll <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of a web <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of lamina material, which will be explained in greater detail, but which includes a sheet to protect information on a printed card, and a heat sensitive bonding layer on the reverse side that would laminate to a substrate or card. The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of evenly-spaced aligning scallops or notches indicated at <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> along opposite edges, with the scallops <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> being rounded to conform to the rounded corners of a typical card indicated at <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> showing rounded corners <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The scallops <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> meet at a junction, and a microperforated transverse line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of reduced strength is provided laterally across the web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is thus divided into individual lamina sheets <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of selected standard card size and shape, such as CR<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> type cards. The microperforations are spaced so that the individual sheets will be the same size as a card <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. When indexed appropriately and laminated onto the card the sheets <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> will come all the way out to the edges and to the corners of the cards or substrates without protruding at the corner where the lamina could be grasped and lifted. The use of the scallops <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> permits the close fit, and true edge to edge printing on all of the card surface, if the reverse side printing is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> of lamina can take several different forms, but preferably, the lamina would be a sheet one of two layered forms indicated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, respectively. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the lamina is shown as having a polyester over layer or outer layer <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> that would be exposed to the elements when laminated onto a card, which is indicated at <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, a holographic system layer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> which is well-known in the field, and comprises a layer that can be bonded to polyester using a suitable adhesive, and permit the holograms to be put into place, and other information recorded. A vinyl layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> would then be bonded to the holographic layer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, and would be used for either printing or directly adhering to the substrate or card illustrated at <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. When the reverse side of the lamina is printed, the printing is indicated at <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment could be a cartridge or housing of precut sheets of lamina that can be fed individually, using a known feeder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A simplified form of the web that is provided as a lamina is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and includes a vinyl layer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, that would be directly laminated to the substrate <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, or a printing layer <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> can also be provided on the vinyl before laminating in accordance with the subsequent disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the discussion, when mention is made of printing on the reverse side of the web or lamina, it is meant that this is the side that would be in contact with the substrate, and the printing would be so that it was readable when the lamina was laminated to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, apparatus is shown for laminating substrates or cards. A printer assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A is outlined in dotted lines and is of the dye-sublimation type that utilizes a printer ribbon actuated with a printing head assembly. The printer ribbon <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B is taken from a supply roll and is taken up by a take-up roll <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is suitably driven from a motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. The motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is a stepper motor that is controlled by a main control <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, which is a logic type controller that sequences operations of the overall laminating assembly. The print ribbon <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B passing a sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is used for insuring that a ribbon is present so that the printing head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can operate against a platen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as desired. Idler rollers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are used for guiding the print ribbon <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B in its desired path over the platen roller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The lamina web supply roll <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is illustrated schematically and is rotatably mounted on the frame that is used for the printer. The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> passes a sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and then passes up over the platen roller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as guided by a guide roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The reverse side, or the vinyl side of the web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, for example, that is shown in either <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is passed under the print head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that the reverse side of the lamina may be printed on to include the desired message. The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> then passes through suitably rotatable mounted guide rollers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and up over a further guide roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the desired path of travel, and passes through a sensor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for sensing presence of the web and providing desired information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A pair of feed or pinch rollers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are rotatably mounted on side frame plates and receive the web. The feed rollers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> include a drive roller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is driven from a stepper motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The roller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a pinch roller or pressure roller that is spring loaded against the drive roller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that positive drive of the web is achieved. The web is then fed into a second set of feed rollers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which also includes a stepper motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A driving roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The stepper motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A are individually controlled from the control <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C of the unit. The roller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is a pinch roller constructed in a known manner for driving various sheets of material as well as webs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The speed of the first set of drive rollers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the speed of the second set of drive rollers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are controlled by the respective stepper motors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A. When the web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is positioned with a reduced strength cross line between the first and second sets of drive rollers, varying the speed of the sets of rollers relative to each other will place a tension load on the web and cause the separation across the region of reduced strength. The split or separation of a sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. An individual lamina sheet shown at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be held in the second set of drive rollers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This individual sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is directed past a sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which will provide a signal indicating when the leading edge of the individual sheet that has been severed passes through, and also when the leading edge of the next sheet, which remains attached to the web, is received so that the motors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A can be driven to provide the tension on the web between the rollers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the rollers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to again break out or separate out a lamina sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Lamina sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then driven by the rollers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> through the sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a set of laminating rollers including a heated roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a laminating platen roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that are suitably driven also through a stepper motor indicated at <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A. The signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is used to bring a substrate and the lamina sheet into registry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A substrate or card supply hopper <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a card feeder of conventional design indicated only schematically at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and feeds cards, such as that shown at <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, past a first sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> where they are gripped by feed roller such as a drive rollers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> driven with a stepper motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A and an idler roller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> passes through a sensor that senses the card presence, and then a second sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which provides signals to the controls for determining the card position just prior to entry into the laminating rollers. The card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is then fed by stepper motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A to position it when correlated with a signal from a sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for the lamina sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that the lamina sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the leading edge of the card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are precisely aligned as they go through the laminating rollers including the heater roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the driven platen roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The laminated card, which is then covered with a lamina sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and with the reverse side printing of the sheet printed, is moved as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B to a set of transport rollers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that are driven again by suitable stepper motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A. The laminated cards are then deposited in a discharge hopper illustrated schematically at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this form of the apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the steps of the process illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are followed, with reverse side printing on the web of lamina, that is, on the side which is ultimately laminated to a substrate or card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The separation of the web into individual lamina sheets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is done by using a line of reduced strength across the web and providing a suitable tension load on the web between the first and second sets of rollers to cause the separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the apparatus is exactly the same as it is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except that in place of controlling the motors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to create a tension in the web and cause separation of individual sheets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by lines of reduced strength across the web, a web of lamina without the scallops and without the lines of reduced strength is carried on the roll <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the web, indicated at <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A passes through a cutter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that is positioned between the first set of drive roller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the second set of drive roller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and in response to a signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the controls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, the cutter is operated to sever the web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A into individual sheets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A that would be laminated to cards <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in exactly the same manner as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A would be printed on the reverse side, as previously stated, and then using the cutter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> severed into the individual sheets of lamina <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and laminated onto a substrate or card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. If desired, the scallops could be used on the web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A, but there is no need for the microperforations. The use of the scallops would enhance the ability to use the full surface of the card for information by having the rounded corners that would match with the rounded corners of the card, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If desired in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> the sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be movably mounted so that any size lamina, limited only by the range of movement of the sensor, may be determined and separated at the time of cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Again, the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is followed, but the separation of lamina sheets is not carried out as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but separation is by using the cutter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a modified form of the invention, in which the cards are printed, and individual sheets of lamina are separated using the cross microperforated lines of reduced strength across the web from the supply. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> printer section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the same as the printer section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, but it is used for printing onto cards in this form of the invention. The printer ribbon is indicated at <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and is provided from a supply roll <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to a take-up roll <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which is driven from a motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This is a stepper motor again, that controls the feeding of the printer ribbon for dye-sublimation printing. Again, any desired type of printer can be used. A sensor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is provided to sense presence of the ribbon, and the ribbon extends over guide rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> so that it is guided across a print head <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> that is in registry with a platen <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A card supply <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a card feeder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that feeds cards as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> past a sensor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and into a pair of card drive rollers <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, which are used to drive the card shown at <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in its path of travel. The roller <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is driven from a suitable stepper motor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from central controller indicated here at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which controls the various functions including the printer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and the stepper motors. The controller receive signals from the sensor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a second sensor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that senses when a card is moved through the card feed rollers <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As the card <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> passes over the platen <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, it is printed with information controlled by the print head <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> using the ribbon <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and thus has information on its upper surface. The card <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is fed through further card feed rollers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and through a set of transport rollers <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> that support and guide the card past a sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The card shown at <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>A has been printed on, and is passed into the laminating rollers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The roller <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is a heated roller and the roller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is driven from a stepper motor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A lamina supply roll <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> provides the web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> that has the crossed lines of reduced strength, and it is rotatably mounted on a frame and is used for laminating onto the preprinted card <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> passes through a sensor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> into a first set of feed rollers <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The roll <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is a driven roll, while the roll <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is a pressure roller. The roll <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is driven from a stepper motor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> under control of the control section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A second set of drive rolls <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are provided spaced from the first set of drive rolls a selected distance. The second set of drive rolls includes a driven roll <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> that is driven from a stepper motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that also is controlled by the control <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided downstream from the second set of drive rolls <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and between the drive rolls <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and the laminating set of rolls <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A schematic side view of the rollers <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The rollers are rotatably mounted on frame plates <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> in brushing. The rollers <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can be driven by a gear from roller <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, if desired. A gear set can be used between the stepping motor and roller <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will sense the leading edge of web <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, and will provide a signal to the controller <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so that the first set of feed rolls <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the second set of feed rolls <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> will be differentially driven by their respective motors <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to create a tension in the web and provide a separation of the web to form individual sheets <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the lamina by breaking the individual sheet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> off from the rest of the web along a cross line of reduced strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Then, the signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is used for ensuring that the leading edge of the sheet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is properly aligned with the leading edge of the card <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> as they are fed into the laminating rollers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> so that the lamination can take place with the lamina sheet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> precisely positioned relative to the card of substrate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Transport rollers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will receive the card after lamination, and will move the card into an output hopper <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. The roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is drive with a suitable stepper motor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as shown. All of the stepper motors are coordinated in movement through the controller <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in precise positioning of the card as well as the lamina sheet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The use of the reduced strength cross line or microperforated cross line on the web for separating out the individual lamina sheets sized to be identical to the size of the substrate or card being used eliminates the need for a separate cutter, thereby reducing costs by eliminating parts and reducing some complexity because of the need for normally quite precisely operating the cutter so that the lamina sheet that will be laminated onto the substrate is the right size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Also as stated, the use of the scallops along the edges of the web of lamina material makes the lamina sheets that are formed to be the exact configuration and size of the card so that a greater area of the card is available for having printing displayed thereon. This printing can either be on the reverse side of the lamina itself, or on the card as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
