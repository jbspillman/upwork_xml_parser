<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to magnetic therapeutic devices. More particularly, the present invention pertains to devices for the application of magnetic fields to specific regions of the human body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Magnets or biomagnets have long been used to expose particular regions of the human body to magnetic flux lines. The influence of biomagnets has been reported to improve circulation and reduce inflammation. As a result, pain may be reduced and strength may be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A number of flexible magnetic pads have been disclosed to the public as providing therapeutic effects, including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,514,072 and 5,538,495 (a flexible magnetic pad with multi-directional constantly alternating polarity zones); U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,532 (a flexible magnetic sheet for therapeutic use); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,111 (a therapeutic magnetic sheet with repeated curved areas); the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The magnetic pads are applied to various regions of the body, such as the legs and arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Additionally, magnets have been placed in wraps, jewelry and the soles of shoes to provide therapeutic effects. Magnets have also been incorporated into numerous other devices, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,480,596 (lumbar belts), U.S. Pat. No. 5,642,739 (armbands), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,046 (clothing). Each device is used for exposing specifically defined, external regions of the human body to a magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It has been reported that biomagnets can be placed at strategic points on the body to positively influence pain control by directing magnetic fields to acupuncture points, acupuncture meridians, and the surrounding hard and soft tissue. For example, clothing having discrete magnets attached thereto for producing healing effects at acupuncture points has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,046, which issued Feb. 24, 1998 to Lopez et al., the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. More specifically, Lopez teaches clothing and other personal wear which utilizes discrete magnets to direct magnetic fields towards acupuncture points along the human torso; acupuncture points on the head along the temporal region, soft spot and upper most vertebrae region at the base of the skull; and acupuncture points on the body appendages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Although magnetic fields have been applied to a number of locations along the outer human body, none of the above-cited patents teaches or suggests the use of magnets for primarily applying a magnetic field to the lower temporal/mandibular region of a human head. Further, none of the above-cited patents teaches or suggests inserting magnetic devices into cavities of the human body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The lower temporal/mandibular region, as defined throughout this disclosure, refers to particular skeletal regions of the face and cranium along with the surrounding soft tissue. More specifically, the lower temporal/mandibular region includes the zygomatic bone, mandible, lower portion of the temporal bone, mastoid process, zygomatic arch, maxillae and surrounding soft tissue. The region of exposure preferably includes that region which is proximate the joint connecting the jaw to the cranium, longitudinally extending from the top of the ears to the tip of the chin and latitudinally extending the width of the lower portion of the jawbone to the upper portion of the cheekbone. Additionally, none of the patents referred to above have disclosed or suggested the application of magnetic fields to the outer ear, the middle ear or the inner ear, the inside of the mouth or mouth cavity or to a healing wound. It is believed that application of a magnetic field to the lower temporal/mandibular region of the human head or within certain body cavities will positively impact blood circulation and cell polarity, thus reducing pain, fatigue, and stress, and to increase strength. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With more particularity and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>there is depicted therein a magnetic therapeutic device in accordance with the present invention comprising a mouthpiece, which is generally denoted at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The mouthpiece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and at least one magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed therein. In addition to providing magnetic therapeutic effects to the maxillo-facial regions, the mouthpiece may additionally protect the oral infrastructure and favorably alter the vertical height of the dental occlusion to positively influence pain control, enhance strength and endurance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a height H, width W, and length L and may be adapted to fit within the mouth of either an adult or child. The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> separates the upper teeth from the lower teeth by the height H of the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the height or separation H of the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides from about 2 mm to about 3 mm of clearance between the posterior molars and from about 6 mm to about 8 mm of clearance between the anterior incisors. The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be U-shaped or parabolic so as to properly fit about the teeth. The length L of the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably extends along the entire length of the bottom and the top rows of teeth. The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality of peaks and valleys (not shown) that conform to or fit about the individual teeth of a human mouth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a conventional mouth guard, bite splint or the like. Suitable mouth guards, in addition to others, include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,941, which issued on Dec. 20, 1988 to Quinton, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,250,272, 3,211,143, 2,630,117, 3,224,441, 3,124,129, 3,096,761, 3,112,744, the disclosures, all of which, are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may further have at least one channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for seating the teeth of the human mouth therein. The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have at least one wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and preferably a second wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, extending therefrom to form the channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be preformed within the bite plate to conform to either the teeth or the gums of a human mouth or both, as may be the case for a person who does not have teeth. The channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may house either the upper set of teeth, the lower set of teeth, or may house both or the upper gums, the lower gums or both. Preferably, the channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fits about the upper set of teeth. The channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adapted to hold the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> securely in place and may additionally protect the teeth from a frontal blow to the mouth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be preformed or custom fit to a particular individual&apos;s mouth and bite pattern. For example, a cast of the teeth or gums may be taken to form a die-cast of the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of hard plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed of semi-ridged rubber or plastic, pliable rubber, rigid plastic, or like materials. Pliable rubber or pliable plastic allows the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be used as an athletic mouth guard. The favorable protective mechanism provided by a semi-ridged material between the maxillary and mandibular detention will help prevent tooth trauma, oral lacerations, temporal/mandibular joint dysfunction, and cranial/sacral injury. The bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also be substantially formed of thermoplastic. Thermoplastic allows an end user to heat the bite plate in hot water and mold the bite plate to the end user&apos;s specific bite profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed of a hard plastic or rubber. Hard rubber or plastic allows the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be used as a bite splint. A bite splint reduces wear between the upper teeth and lower teeth and may be used by people who grind their teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is important to the present invention that the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have a magnetic source, magnetic device or magnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed therein. As shown, the magnetic <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> resides between a bottom layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a top layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The bottom layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the top layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> preferably provide a separation H of about 2 mm to about 10 mm between the top set of teeth and the bottom set of teeth. Alternatively, the magnetic device may be made integral (not shown) with the bite plate to form a single, uniformly and integrally constructed magnetic mouthpiece, such as a soft material or body having magnetic properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed within the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using any suitable means of manufacture including molding the bite plate around the magnetic device, layering the bite plate between the bottom layer and top layer and securing the magnetic device with adhesives, etc. Alternatively, as in the case where the magnetic device is made integral with the bite plate (not shown), the manufacture of such device may be accomplished by embedding magnetic particulates within a thermoplastic, semi-rigid plastic or rubber bite plate and forming the bite plate to fit about the teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and those described throughout the ensuing disclosure, may be anything that produces a magnetic field, including for example a discrete ferrite magnet, a plurality of discrete ferrite magnets, an electromagnet, ferro-magnetic alloy, etc. Preferably, the magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a rubbery-flexible synthetic material in which permanent magnetic particles, such as ferrite particles, have been imbedded. The magnetic device preferably generates a magnetic flux density of about 50 to about 2500 gauss. The magnetic device preferably has a magnetic flux density of about 400 to about 1000 gauss and more preferably from about 800 to about 1000 gauss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may comprise constantly alternating north/south polarity zones. The magnetic device may also comprise a flexible planar magnetic sheet having a specific pattern of repeating alternating polarity, such that poles of the same polarity are disposed about the magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a staggered position. The magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be formed of a flexible magnetic sheet having a variety of patterns including: a spiral pattern emanating from the center of the device and having magnetic poles of alternating polarity, or some other geometric shape, such as concentrically arranged rings, sectors, quadrangles or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The magnetic source is disposed in the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an orientation suitable for exposing the joints, bones, and surrounding soft tissue to a magnetic field. In particular, when a flat magnetic device is used, the magnetic field radiating therefrom exposes the body tissue to a field flux at an angle of from about 45 to 90 degrees, relative to an axis formed by the surface of the flat magnetic device. Preferably, the magnetic device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is disposed within the bite plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to deliver a magnetic field with a flux of about 90 degrees relative to the surface of the magnet to provide the maximum exposure of body tissue to the flux lines of the magnetic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, shown therein is a magnetic therapeutic device in accordance with the present invention comprising headgear, shown generally at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The headgear comprises means <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for positioning a magnetic device about an ear or about the lower temporal/mandibular region of the human head or both, wherein the means <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for positioning has at least one magnetic device <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The means <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for positioning may be an ear guard, a support ring that encircles the ear, an ear covering, an earmuff, etc. As shown, the means for positioning the magnetic device comprises at least one ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having at least one magnetic device <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> disposed within the ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As may become evident from this disclosure, the headgear may further comprise two individual ear guards (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be adapted to shelter and protect a human ear. The ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably a convex housing having a thickness, an inner side and an outer side. The ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may comprise a convex, hard shell or pliable covering. The hard shell may be formed of leather, plastic, rubber, etc. Padding may be attached to the inside of the hard shell using suitable fastening means, such as riveting, gluing, etc. Alternatively, the ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a pliable covering without a hard outer shell. The pliable covering may be formed of leather, plastic or the like and padded with material, such as foam rubber, cotton batting or the like. Padding is used to cushion and absorb the force of blows that may be delivered to the ear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus, the ear guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may perform a multitude of purposes besides solely supporting the magnetic device: such as protecting the ears from physical blows, protecting the ears from cold temperatures, etc. The headgear of the present invention may resemble the types of headgear used in wrestling, hockey, baseball, football, water polo, cycling, etc. For example, a football helmet has a padded inner lining, the inner lining has a recess which encircles the ears, thus forming an ear guard within the helmet. </paragraph>
