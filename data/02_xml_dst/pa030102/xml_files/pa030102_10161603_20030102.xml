<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to managing websites that market goods and/or services, and, more particularly, the invention relates to managing data to and from the website in an e-commerce environment to increase website traffic and to better market the goods and/or services on the website. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> E-commerce applications that market and sell products and services over the Internet are known. The number of consumers using online commerce to purchase or sell keeps increasing as more people become comfortable with transacting over the Internet. Further, the number of websites engaged in online commerce also increases as potential entrepreneurs take advantage of low overhead and worldwide access for their goods and services. As the number of online consumers and businesses increases, the number of websites and consumer choices also increases. Unlike brick and mortar stores, a large variety of online commerce websites may be available to a consumer in one location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To increase website traffic and to attract potential customers, online commerce websites should aggressively market their goods and/or services. With an increasing number of competitors, online commerce websites aim to stand out from the crowd with advertisements, inducements such as sales and coupons, name recognition, targeted customers and direct marketing. Old and new marketing techniques have been developed to market online commerce websites, but the costs or resources may be too high for small or new online ventures. Further, these techniques may not be effective for a specific website. Thus, online commerce websites seek to increase potential customers and to effectively market their goods and/or services without prohibitive marketing costs. Moreover, direct marketing potential has not been realized. Direct marketing practices may include selling to customers via catalogs and other mail solicitations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The described preferred embodiments pertain to a website management system and methods that promote direct marketing principles in an online environment. Website management may be implemented using software that executes within the system. The system may include servers, nodes, client computers, relational databases that store pertinent information, data pipes, routers, hosting services, and the like. The software may be a software tool that references a set of relational database tables, indices, and procedures that store website data and processes for selecting and displaying the appropriate data at the appropriate time. The software may include applications to increase website traffic and revenue by the methods disclosed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments, illustrative computers and/or servers employed for implementing some embodiments of the invention can include, e.g.: central processing units; memory (e.g., RAM, etc.); digital data storage (e.g., hard drives, etc.); input/output ports (e.g., parallel and/or serial ports, etc.); user interfaces (e.g., monitors, etc.); data entry devices (e.g., key boards, etc.); etc. In some embodiments, client computers may contain browser software for interacting with the server(s), such as, for example, using hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to make requests of the server(s) via the Internet or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The applications may include the dynamic display of website content tailored to the user, automatic generation of upsell items through the analysis of previous order information, automatic generation and delivery of &ldquo;abandoned cart&rdquo; email to customers that quit shopping on the website, immediate customer signup for e-newsletters without leaving the home page and with automatic replacement of email signup text with new offer text, automatic population of categories with items ranked by sales for a specified period, use of sale figures to prioritize the responses to website search queries, and automatic website display of offline, or mailed, promotions. The described preferredembodiments utilize the software and its applications in an automatic manner to reduce the time spent by website managers for data management. Further, the described preferred embodiments facilitate unique website displays that may not manually be created in an efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> depict flowcharts for displaying a website in a tailored, dynamic manner in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> may be utilized in conjunction with each other to disclose the embodiments of the present invention. Dynamic display of website content may include two components, such as website visitor identification and dynamically tailoring the website display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, however, are not limited to these two components, and may include other components as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art. Descriptive copy, product prices, and unique offers are some of the content that may be individually displayed to a customer on the website. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts the database tables used in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> executes by detecting a website visitor, or user, visiting the website. The user may visit the website by entering the website via a webpage displayed on the user computer using a web browser. In step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the user may be defined as a user who is not a new customer and who has not received a solicitation email. Step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the user has a cookie identification on the user&apos;s computer that the described preferred embodiments recognize. The cookie identification may be the primary key used to determine how other variables and data within the attached database relate to the user, and how information may be used to tailor the website display for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is no, then step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> executes by assigning a cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, to the user&apos;s computer. Cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> preferably is generated as a ten-digit alphanumeric text that is placed and stored on the user&apos;s computer during the first website visit. Cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> is created as a primary key in the website management database. Step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> executes by creating a customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> to be entered in a customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The described preferred embodiments enable the website to associate cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> with a ten digit identification in the software database. This feature allows the software database to retrieve and act upon any customer data that may exist. Step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> executes by entering cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> into customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is yes, then the user has visited the website previously from the same computer as cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> already exists. Cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> may be the primary key that is used in combination with other key data to tailor the website display. Other data, however, may be determined before cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> is used. Thus, if step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is yes, then step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the referral uniform resource locator (&ldquo;URL&rdquo;) used by the website user to enter the website contains a source code included in the URL address. The described preferred embodiments attempt to match source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight> listed inside source code database table <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> with any text that follows the text &ldquo;sid&equals;.&rdquo; If yes, then step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> executes by matching the matching offer code with a list of possible offer codes in offer code database table <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. If step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is no, then step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the referral URL&apos;s domain name is recognized. The described preferred embodiments check referral URL domain name <highlight><bold>2082</bold></highlight>. If step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is yes, then step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> executes by matching referral domain name <highlight><bold>2082</bold></highlight> with a list of possible domain names in referral URL database table <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to find source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight>. If step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is no, then the described preferred embodiments proceed to step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, as disclosed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> executes by matching cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> with corresponding customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> in customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> executes by entering the matching source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight> and customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> in mailed database table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> executes by continuing the disclosed embodiments to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, which discloses steps <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the website has previously entered customer data for the user per the user&apos;s cookie identification. The described preferred embodiments attempt to identify a cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> in customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. If yes, then step <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> executes by matching cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> in customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> with customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>. Cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> also may correspond to a customer name <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight>, a customer address information <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight>, an email address <highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight>, and a customer preference(s) <highlight><bold>2032</bold></highlight> for customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>.

Step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> executes by updating the source code and the customer number listings in a mailed database table, the source code and offer code listings in a source code database table, and the offer data in an offer code database table. For example, referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the described preferred embodiments update source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight> and customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> in mailed database table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight> and offer code <highlight><bold>2064</bold></highlight> in source code database table <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and offer text <highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight>, offer start active date <highlight><bold>2104</bold></highlight>, offer expiration date <highlight><bold>2106</bold></highlight> and offer discount <highlight><bold>2108</bold></highlight> in offer code database table <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The updating process may occur periodically to include the newest mailing sent to customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> executes by visiting the website by a customer, user, or visitor. Step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the cookie identification matches listing in a customer database table. For example, referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the described preferred embodiments determine if the cookie identification provided by the customer matches cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> in customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. If no, then step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> executes by showing a default display page to the customer. Step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the customer entered a customer number into a customer registration text box displayed on the website. Thus, the described preferred embodiments may display the default display page until the customer enters a customer number, such as customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>, in the customer registration text box. If step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> is no, then step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> executes by showing the default display page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> If step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> is yes, then step <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> executes by determining whether the customer number matches a customer number listing in the customer database table. For example, the described preferred embodiments determine whether the entered customer number matches customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> in customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. If no, then step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> is executed as disclosed above. If step <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> is yes, then the described preferred embodiments proceed to step <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight> disclosed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is yes, then step <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> executes by matching the cookie identification with the corresponding customer number in the customer database table. For example, the described preferred embodiments match cookie identification <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> with customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> in customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight> executes by matching the customer number from the customer database table with the source code in the mailed database table. For example, the described preferred embodiments match customer number <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> from customer database table <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> with source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight> of mailed database table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> executes by matching the source code with the offer code in the source code database table. For example, the described preferred embodiments match source code <highlight><bold>2062</bold></highlight> with offer code <highlight><bold>2064</bold></highlight> in source code database table <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight> executes by matching the offer code with data in the offer code database table. For example, the described preferred embodiments match offer code <highlight><bold>2064</bold></highlight> with data in offer code database table <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The data may include offer text, an offer start active date, an offer expiration date, and an offer discount. Step <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> executes by displaying the offer data to the customer, or user, and using the appropriate offer discount when the customer places an order. For example, the described preferred embodiments display the offer data in offer code database table <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the customer. Further, the described preferred embodiments may apply offer discount <highlight><bold>2108</bold></highlight> to any order placed by the customer. All of these actions may occur even if the customer has not entered any data on the website. The described preferred embodiments may reduce the number of steps to provide discount or offer information to a customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The described preferred embodiments pertain to methods and systems to market products and services in an e-commerce environment through the use of the novel features disclosed. E-commerce environment features may include accessing a webpage or website over the Internet, viewing products and services, and conducting business and transaction by sending data over the Internet to a host for the website or webpage. The described preferred embodiments include a database having database tables. The database tables may include fields for specific values used by the processes, methods, and procedures in updating, modifying, and presenting the website to a customer. A system may be utilized that executes the methods disclosed herein. The system may include the database coupled to a supported network, such as the Internet or a local area network, that provides data, information, data exchange capabilities, such as email, to nodes, computers, workstations, and the like. For example, the database may be used in conjunction with a web hosting service to provide data on products, offers, information, and the like on a webpage viewed by a customer on a computer via the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The data within the database tables may be manipulated to provide updated or tailored information to the customer without excessive steps or data entry from the customer. By using emails, URLs, and other known components of e-commerce, the described preferred embodiments use this information to promote marketing of products and services in a unique manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The database tables may reside in a database on a server coupled to the network. Alternatively, the database tables may reside in memory on different machines or servers that are accessible by a central software program. The described preferred embodiments may implement a software program including instructions executable on a computing platform that results in actions being performed using the database tables and other information. The software program may reside on a central computer or server, or may reside on a machine hosting the database tables disclosed above. The software may be downloaded to the website location or may reside with a third party for use by the website. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the software program of the described preferred embodiments executes on a Microsoft Windows 2000&trade; platform as a software tool that utilizes active server pages developed in virtual basic script language to incorporate the features disclosed above. These features provide a website management system that is more dynamic and user-friendly than known systems. The software tool of the described preferred embodiments references a set of relational database tables, as disclosed above, indices, and procedures/process, as disclosed above, that store the website data and methods for selecting and displaying the appropriate and tailored data. Website traffic and e-commerce revenue may be maximized because of the benefits of the features disclosed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> One feature may be the dynamic display of website content, such as descriptive copy, product prices, or unique offers, that is individually tailored to the user. Another feature may be the automatic generation of upsell items through the analysis of previous order information. Another feature may be the automatic generation and delivery of abandoned cart email to customers that quit shopping the website. Another feature may be customer sign-up for e-newsletters without leaving the webpage, or home page, and the automatic replacement of e-newsletter solicitation text with new offer text. Another feature may be the automatic population of categories with items ranked by sales for a predetermined period. Another feature may be the use of sales figures to prioritize the responses to website search queries. Another feature may be the automatic website display of an offline, or mailed, promotion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For example, a user may receive an email or mailed catalog that prompts the user to visit the website. By using information within the email or provided by the user, the described preferred embodiments may provide tailored offers, product display, and other information to the user. During the user&apos;s visit, the described preferred embodiments may automatically provide upsell items that the user is more likely to find useful and purchase. The described preferred embodiments may automatically display the most popular items within a category that the user chooses thus more efficiently serving the user by reducing unnecessary navigation. If the user queries the website to find a particular word or phrase, the described preferred embodiments may automatically display the most popular items in order thus saving user time in searching the website. Without the user entering any data, the described preferred embodiments may present an offline promotion to the user and thus increase the likelihood that the user may make a purchase. The user may sign-up for an e-newsletter. After sign-up, the solicitation content may be replaced with promotional content or other information, thereby relieving the user from further navigation on the website. The database tables may be updated with information within the email or provided by the user. If the user leaves the website (in some cases, even if the user has done nothing more than enter the website), an email of items, products, or services within a shopping cart may be sent automatically to the user without referencing redundant data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the wheel assembly of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers all modifications and variations of this invention that come within the scope of any of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
