<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A rotatable tool includes a shaft and a cutting head mounted thereto. The shaft defines a longitudinal axis of rotation and has a seat formed at a front end thereof which includes a first engagement surface. The cutting head is attached on the seat and includes a second engagement surface engaging the first engagement surface for longitudinally locking the cutting head to the shaft. The first and second engagement surfaces include respective first and second support surfaces which together form a planar interface, the interface defining a contact line when viewed longitudinally toward a front end of the tool. The contact line intersects an outer periphery of the cutting head at a point. The contact line extends from the point in a direction forming an acute angle with a radius that intersects the point. The contact line is disposed rotationally ahead of the radius with reference to rotation of the tool. The cutting head is attached to the shaft in response to relative rotation therebetween, whereupon respective longitudinal undercuts formed by the support surfaces engage one another, and a snap action occurs between respective portions of the engagement surfaces, to resist longitudinal and rotational dislodgement of the cutting head. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">AIMS AND FEATURES OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A primary aim of the present invention is to provide a rotatable tool of the kind defined above, where the surfaces for the transferring of torque at the same time serve as surfaces for fixing the replaceable cutting head in the axial direction. Thereby, a replaceable catting head having a relatively small extension in the axial direction is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another aim of the present invention is that the fixation of the replaceable cutting head is carried out by a so-called snap function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Yet another aim of the invention is that portions of the seat are actuated by a force directed towards the center of the tool in an embodiment of the same. Thereby, an improved clamping of the cutting head in the seat is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another aim of the present invention is to provide a satisfactory cooling of the cutting head, especially in regard to the front surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another aim of the present invention is that the cutting head should be given such geometry that it is relatively simple to manufacture, for instance by pressing, if it is made from cemented carbide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At least the primary aim of the present invention is realized by means of a rotatable tool that comprises a shaft and a cutting head attached thereto. The shaft defines a longitudinal axis of rotation and includes a chip removal passage for removing chips, and a longitudinal front end forming a seat which includes a first engagement surface that extends generally longitudinally and generally radially with reference to the axis. The cutting head is attached on the seat and includes a second engagement surface which extends generally longitudinally and generally radially. The second engagement surface engages the first engagement surface for longitudinally locking the cutting head to the shaft and for transmitting torque between the shaft and the cutting head. The first and second engagement surfaces include respective first and second support surfaces together forming a planar interface which defines a contact line when viewed longitudinally toward a front end of the tool. The contact line intersects an outer periphery of the cutting head at a point. The contact line extends from the point in a direction forming an acute angle with a radius that intersects the point. The contact line is disposed rotationally ahead of the radius with reference to rotation of the tool during a cutting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention also pertains to a replaceable cutting head mountable to a rotatable shaft. The cutting head comprises a body which defines a longitudinal axis and includes a front cutting end and a rear mounting end. The mounting end includes a pair of engagement surfaces facing one another. The cutting end has a cutting edge structure for performing a cutting function when the cutting head is rotated in a direction of rotation about the axis. Each engagement surface extends longitudinally and radially with reference to the axis. Each engagement surface includes a support surface portion which defines a line when viewed longitudinally toward the front cutting end. The line intersects an outer periphery of the cutting head at a point. The line extends from the point in a direction forming an acute angle with a radius of the body that intersects the point. The line is disposed rotationally ahead of the radius with reference to the direction of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The method further pertains to a method of attaching a cutting head to a shaft by rotating the cutting head, whereupon respective longitudinal undercuts of the cutting head and the shaft engage one another, and a snap action occurs.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the twist drill comprises a shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as well as a replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> assembled on the shaft. The shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with two chip channels <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which define respective passages for removing the chips which are generated when the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> machines a workpiece. Only one of the chip channels <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The twist drill also comprises in a conventional way a fastening part (not shown), which is intended to be attached in a chuck or the like of a machine tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, a seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> arranged in a front longitudinal end of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown more in detail, whereby the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is arranged at the end of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is opposite from the fastening part. The seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of different surfaces, which shall cooperate in order to give a satisfactory support to the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in an optimum way when the same is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, the cutting seat comprises a bottom surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as well as two sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged diametrically with respect to a longitudinal axis of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the end surfaces of the sidewalls cooling ducts <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> port. Each of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes two engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which face each other. Each engagement surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is generally composed of convex and concave portions, whereby said portions have an axial extension which is parallel to the axial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each of those engagement surfaces includes a central first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is straddled by first and second concave portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that are disposed adjacent respective sides of the convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. On the side of the first concave portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which is remote from the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have a second convex portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. On the side of the second convex portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is remote from the first concave portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connects with the second convex portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, whereby the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an extension generally inwards towards the center of the tool. As is most clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, said first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an inclination in the axial direction, the importance of which will be closer explained below in connection with the interaction between the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the replaceable cutting bead <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being described. The first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has such an inclination in the axial direction that the respective planes which are defined by said support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the bottom surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> form an angle with each other which is smaller than 90&deg;. As for the extension of the support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generally inwards towards the center of the tool, it should be pointed out that such extension does not pass exactly through the center of the twist drill. The significance of this will be illustrated more closely below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> planar view is shown of the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which comprises a body having two cutting edges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as well as two engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> facing away from each other. Those engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a complementary shape to respective ones of the mutually facing engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, each of the engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is generally composed of convex and concave portions, whereby said portions have an axial extension which is parallel to the axial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, each of the engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a centrally located third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which is intended to cooperate with the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a respective sidewall <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Disposed next to the third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a direction towards the outer circumference of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is a third convex portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is intended to be located exactly opposite the first concave portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the respective sidewall <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Disposed next to the third convex portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, in a direction towards the outer circumference of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is a fourth concave portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which is intended to be located exactly opposite the second convex portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the respective sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Situated next to the fourth concave portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, in a direction towards the outer circumference of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is a second support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is intended to cooperate with the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the respective sidewall <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In a way corresponding to the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the second support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has an extension inwards generally but not exactly towards the tool center when the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Disposed next to the centrally located third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, on the side thereof which is remote from the third convex portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is a fifth concave portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which in the assembled position of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is located exactly opposite the central part of the second concave portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Disposed next to the fifth concave portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, on the side thereof which is remote from the third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, is a fourth convex portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which in the assembled position of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is intended to be located exactly opposite the outermost part of the second concave portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each of the first and second support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is inclined at an angle relative to the axis of rotation as that axis is viewed in a direction perpendicular thereto (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the inclination being such that each of the support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> forms a longitudinal undercut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, an intermediate position of the assembly of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is shown. In that connection, the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been axially inserted into the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whereby the fifth concave portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is located exactly opposite the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the fourth convex portion is located exactly opposite the second concave portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this connection, it should be pointed out that in the intermediate position according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, no satisfactory abutment takes place between the portions which are located exactly opposite each other, but there is always a certain clearance between mutually facing portions which permits turning of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in relation to the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After turning of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (clockwise in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> position the following occurs: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> the centrally located third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will abut against the centrally located first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> the third convex portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be located exactly opposite the first concave portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> the fourth concave portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be located exactly opposite the second convex portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> the fourth convex portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be located exactly opposite the outer part of the second concave portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> the fifth concave portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be located exactly opposite the central part of the second concave portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., a cavity C between said portions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed since both are concave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is entirely turned inwards to the final attached position thereof, also the second support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will abut against the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an inclination in the axial direction and the second support surface has a corresponding inclination in the assembled position of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, said inclination will prevent movement of the cutting insert in axial direction out of the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when the support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are in contact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> That is, since each of the first and second support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> form longitudinal undercuts which engage one another, the cutting head cannot move longitudinally away from the shaft. The support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> together from a planar interface which defines a contact line when viewed longitudinally toward a front end of the tool, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the contact line between the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not located on a radius R to the twist drill which passes through the point of intersection of the contact line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the outer periphery or circumference for the full diameter of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Rather, the contact line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has such a direction that the distance thereof from the radius R increases in the direction inwards towards the center of the twist drill, i.e., an acute angle a is formed therewith (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Furthermore, the contact line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located on the side of the radius R which goes first in the direction of rotation W of the tool, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. That is, the contact line is disposed rotationally ahead of the radius R with reference to rotation of the tool. This means that the force which the second support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> exerts on the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> entails that the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are effected by a certain force directed generally towards the center of the twist drill. Accordingly, the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; around the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which in a favorable way promotes a satisfactory clamping of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> between the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In this connection, it should be mentioned that there should primarily be a satisfactory contact between the support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. From certain aspects, it may be an advantage that satisfactory contact is not established between some of the convex and concave portions of the engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the risk of over determination is reduced. In order for a satisfactory clamping of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be effected in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it is, however, in principle at least necessary that abutment takes place between the third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the same time as abutment take place between the second support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> For manual assembly of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a key is required, which may be formed in several different ways. A torque is to be applied to the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, by means of said key which torque force the protruding transition portion between the third concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the fifth concave portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> past the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As said convex portions pass each other, they constitute abutments which make frictional contact with one another. Accordingly, a small outward deflection of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> normally takes place, i.e., a so-called snap-action. The material of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has such an elasticity that it returns to its original state after the convex portions have passed one another and the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has reached its final position of assembly. Thus, a similar force (snap action) is required to return the cutting head to a released state in a counterclockwise direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous if the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the corresponding concave portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are not located exactly opposite each other when the replaceable cutting head is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Rather, there should be a slight offset relationship therebetween so that the first convex portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exerts a pre-stressing force on the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which ensures that the support surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressed against the support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been consumed, it is disassembled, whereby this takes place by the fact that the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned in the opposite direction in comparison with the assembly thereof. Also in this case, a key is used at manual disassembly. A new unconsumed cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then assembled in the way that has been described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of a rotatable tool according to the present invention, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, relates to a hollow drill that, among other things, differs principally from a twist drill in that the chips generated at the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are removed through an inner passage formed in the tubular shaft <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an identical replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used in the hollow drill according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 9</cross-reference> as in the twist drill according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The seat <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed differently in the hollow drill than in the twist drill. Thus, the seat <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the hollow drill has no bottom surface; rather, a cylindrical pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> constitutes an interior support for the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when the same is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The two diametrically located sidewalls <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the hollow drill have a somewhat different design in comparison with the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the twist drill. As is most clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the surfaces of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, facing towards each other, are generally composed of convex and concave portions, whereby said portions have an axial extension which is parallel to the axial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The sidewalls <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> have a centrally located first convex portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is straddled by first and second concave portions <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent respective sides of the convex portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. On the side of the first concave portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> which is remote from the first convex portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a first support surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is disposed which has an extension inwards generally towards the center of the tool. Said first support surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> has the same inclination in the axial direction as the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the embodiment according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, therefore reference is made to the relevant parts of the text which describes the design and function of the first support surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the hollow drill in principally the same way as the assembly in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the twist drill, therefore reference is made to the relevant parts of the description above which relate to the assembly of the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Also the disassembly is carried out in principally the same way as in the embodiment according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, an additional alternative embodiment is shown of a rotatable tool according to the present invention, in the form of a twist drill, where a shaft <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has two diametrically arranged sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which have an axial extension parallel to the axial direction of the tool. The centrally located first convex portion of each of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is defined by a tubular pin <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which is intended to cooperate via snap-action with a concave portion of the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> when the same is finally assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the corresponding way as at the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> described above, each of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> has a first and a second concave portion <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, respectively, on both sides of the first convex portion/tubular pin <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Since the tubular pin <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is provided with an axial slot, it is significantly more elastically compliant than the convex portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the embodiments described above. This has importance at assembly and disassembly of the replaceable cutting head in the seat. Each of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> also has a first support surface <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, which in a corresponding way as the support surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> has an inclination in the axial direction in order to prevent the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> from unintentionally falling out of the seat <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is shown during assembly in the seat <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, whereby the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has a somewhat different design in comparison to the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The two engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> have a centrally located third concave portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, which is intended to cooperate with the first convex portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Disposed adjacent the third concave portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, in direction outwards towards the circumference of the full diameter of the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> have a third convex portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, which is intended to be located exactly opposite the first concave portion <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In the assembled position of the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the concave portion <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> will serve as a cooling duct in order to supply cooling liquid to the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. In connection with the circumference of the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> have a second support surface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, which is intended to cooperate with the first support surface <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In the corresponding way as for the first support surface <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the second support surface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> has an extension inwards generally towards the center of the tool when the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. In connection with the center portion of the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> have a fourth convex portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, which in the assembled position of the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is intended to be exactly opposite the outermost part of the second concave portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, it is advantageous if the tubular pin <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the corresponding concave portion of the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are not located exactly opposite each other when the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is assembled in the seat <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The tubular pin <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> should exert a pre-stressing force on the replaceable cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> which entails that the support surface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the cutting head <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is pressed against the support surface <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Feasible Modifications of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The cutting edges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> arranged on the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may either be formed in one piece with the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> or constitute separate parts which for instance are connected at the tip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> by soldering. In case the cutting edges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> are integrated with the cutting head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the same is preferably manufactured from cemented carbide, ceramics or another comparatively hard material. It is also feasible that the cutting head is manufactured from a compound material, i.e. that the surface layer consists of a hard material while the core consists of a softer material. In case the cutting edges are arranged on separate cutting inserts, the rest of the cutting head may be manufactured from a suitable steel grade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The number of cutting edges may vary within the scope of the invention. In the embodiments described above, the number of cutting edges is two, however, within the scope of the present invention, more cutting edges are also conceivable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> have an extension all the way up to the free end of the tool. However, within the scope of the present invention it is also feasible that the cutting head has such a design that the same covers the free end of the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the compliance of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be provided with one or more slots, having an axial extension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, the cooling ducts either part in the end surfaces of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or are formed as concave portions <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> in the sidewalls <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. However, other designs of the cooling ducts are also feasible within the scope of the inventions, whereby in that context it should be mentioned that it is fully conceivable that the tool lacks cooling ducts for certain applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in connection with preferred embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additions, deletions, modifications, and substitutions not specifically described may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
