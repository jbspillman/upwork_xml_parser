<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the delivery of relatively small amounts of materials, particularly, dental materials. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of a delivery tube for the delivery of such materials to precise locations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The delivery of dental materials such as adhesives, pit and fissure sealants and the like, requires specialized practices and equipment. Such materials are often affected by light, temperature or the like, and hence, are often stored in small bottles made of dark glass. While this method of storage is useful, it also requires some technique to remove the material from the bottles and to deliver the material to is intended target, namely, the dentition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Because of the small amounts of the materials required, it is difficult to provide a delivery system that not only provides enough material, but which does not result in wasting too much of the material. For example, with dental adhesives, several layers of the material are often required. Some dental practitioners use a brush dipped into the adhesive bottle to remove some of the material and then to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; it onto the target. This may work, but it is sometimes difficult to get enough material onto the brush. Further, repeated dipping into the bottle requires multiple brushes so as to avoid cross contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Some delivery systems are known which include a mechanical dispensing syringe. While these devices also work, they are rather expensive, and when compared to a simple brush, they are difficult and time consuming to operate. Further still, unless they are packaged in pre-filled, one-time use (unit dose) manner, they are also subject to cross contamination between patients. Unit dose syringes, because of their relatively complicated design, also greatly increase costs involved with the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A need exists therefore, for a delivery system for a flowable or liquid material, such as a dental adhesive or sealant, which is as easy to operate as a simple brush, and yet avoids the mechanical complications and time consuming requirements of syringe dispensers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is therefore, an object of the invention to provide a delivery system for a flowable or liquid material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide such a system particularly adaptable for the delivery of dental materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to provide a delivery system as above which is simple to operate and which is relatively inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention, which will become apparent from the following description, are carried out by the invention as now described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In general, a delivery system for a liquid includes a plastic or glass tube having a central passage longitudinally theretrough, preferably, axially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a resilient squeeze pump is positioned at some point along the longitudinal length of the tube, which can be employed to create suction at one end of the tube to thereby draw liquid into the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a still further embodiment, the tube is clear and is made from a flexible plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an additional embodiment, a secondary relief orifice is provided to vent the central passage to the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A dental material delivery kit includes a reservoir or container of a liquid dental material to be delivered. The kit also includes a tube as above, which can be employed to transfer a desired quantity of the material to a target site and to dispense the material at that site. Further, the tube is configured to hold about as much material as required for a given dental procedure, thereby eliminating the need to remove the material from its reservoir or container more than once.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A delivery system according to the present invention is shown by way of example by the number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the attached drawings. Delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used to transport and deliver any liquid or flowable material. For example, delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is particularly suited for removing an amount of a dental material, such as an adhesive or sealant, from a reservoir or bottle (not shown) and to deliver a desired amount of the material to a target site, such as a tooth (not shown). Although delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be employed with any material, these include for example, PRIME &amp; BOND&reg; adhesive and DELTON&reg; pit and fissure sealants available from DENTSPLY International Inc. of York, Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> therethrough. Preferably, central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is longitudinally and axially positioned within tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, although this is not required. Further, multiple passageways <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (not shown) are also within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also preferably extends from a dispensing end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to an opposite, venting end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> therefore, extends from an inlet orifice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> proximate to dispensing end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to a venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) proximate to venting end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. By &ldquo;venting&rdquo; it is meant that the orifice opens to the atmosphere. Hence, central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> opens to the atmosphere through venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from any material such as plastic or glass. However, it is preferred to fabricate tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from a clear, flexible plastic material, such as that used to fabricate the SaniTip&reg; air/water syringe tip, also available from DENTSPLY International Inc. Tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may also be of any length or size, and may include a central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of any dimension, depending upon the needs of the end use. Further, when tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fabricated from a flexible material, the shape of tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be changed by flexing, thereby allowing improved access to confined areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In use, tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is grasped in the hand of a user, such that the user can manipulate tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and at the same time, selectively place a finger (not shown) over venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to thereby selectively close venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Without closing off venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted dispensing end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> first, into a reservoir of the material to be dispensed (not shown) until a desired quantity of the material flows through dispensing orifice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and into central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Material may flow into central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by capillary action or the like. The determination of the amount of material is facilitated when tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is clear, allowing the operator to visually inspect central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Gradient marks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be placed upon tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to further facilitate the determination of the amount of material thereby taken up into central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Before removing tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the material reservoir, venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is closed off, preferably by the aforementioned use of the operator&apos;s finger, or by any other means. When tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is then withdrawn from the material reservoir, atmospheric pressure will cause the material to remain within central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, regardless of the orientation of tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can then be moved to the target site and an amount of the material allowed to flow from central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through dispensing orifice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by momentarily and/or partially uncovering venting end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, causing pressure within central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to again equal atmospheric. Material within central passageway may then flow under the influence of gravity or the like. To further facilitate the application of the material thereby dispensed from tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a brush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be provided proximate to dispensing end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Brush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be used to direct and control the material flowing from dispensing orifice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> deformable, rubber-like or resilient squeeze pump <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided at some point along the longitudinal length of tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, preferably between dispensing end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and venting end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In use, an operator can squeeze or deform pump <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing its internal volume. When released, and the volume returns to the pre-deformed size, suction is induced through central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby inducing material to flow into central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through dispensing orifice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When pump <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is again squeezed, thereby again reducing its internal volume, material in central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is forced out of central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through dispensing orifice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and is thereby dispensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> secondary venting orifice <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be provided in addition to or in the alternative to venting orifice <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, at any other location, but which also vents central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the atmosphere. In the embodiment of the secondary venting orifice <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, secondary venting orifice is placed in the sidewall of tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at a location proximate to dispensing end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A dental material delivery kit includes a reservoir or container (not shown) of a liquid dental material to be delivered. The kit also includes a delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as above, which can be employed to transfer a desired quantity of the material to a target site and to dispense the material at that site. Further, delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to hold about as much material as required for a given dental procedure, thereby eliminating the need to remove the material from its reservoir or container more than once. That is, enough material can be drawn into central passageway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to facilitate several applications of the material to a target site, thereby eliminating the need to remove additional material from the original reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A still further embodiment of the invention employs a squeeze bulb <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to draw into and dispense material from tube <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It should now be apparent that the present invention provides a delivery system for a liquid or flowable material, such as a dental material, and otherwise meets the objectives of the invention as set forth. All variations of the invention have not been described or depicted, but are within the scope of the invention as will be readily appreciated by one of skill in the art. Similarly, the drawings provided are exemplary only and do not show all variations of the invention that are possible and that are within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
