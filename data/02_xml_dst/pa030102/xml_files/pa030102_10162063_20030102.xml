<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A control section controls a switch to a charge period so as to charge a voltage-increasing capacitor at a start up. Then, the control section controls the switch to a voltage-increasing period so as to increase a voltage by a voltage-increasing capacitor and charges the output capacitor. The switching section alternately switches the charge period and the voltage-increasing period so that the charged voltage of the output capacitor, i.e., the output voltage is always stabilized within a range of the output voltage in a steady state. Here, a soft start circuit controls the switching section to carry out the switching operation so that the charged voltage always becomes not more than the output voltage in the steady state at the start-up. </paragraph>

The stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is structured so as to include an integrated portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an input capacitor C<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an output capacitor C<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provided outside the integrated portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The integrated portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a reference voltage source <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Further, the integrated portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with an output terminal T<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> outputting an output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, an input terminal T<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to which an input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is inputted from a power source such as a battery, a feedback terminal T<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, a GND terminal T<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a capacitor connection terminal T<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to which an electrode C&minus; having a lower potential of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected, and a capacitor connection terminal T<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to which an electrode C&plus; having a higher potential of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a switched capacitor section is structured by the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> controls switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the switched capacitor section. When the control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> controls the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to be ON and the switches S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to be OFF, and the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is applied to the input terminal T<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via the input capacitor C<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is charged. Next, when the control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> controls the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to be OFF and the switches S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to be ON, the respective potentials of the electrodes of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> increase by the potential of the input terminal T<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The voltage increased by such an operation is outputted as the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>via the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is detected by the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at a point connecting the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is inputted to a non-reversal input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> compares the voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> with a reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> generated by the reference power source <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and inputted to a reversal input terminal. When the voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> outputs a signal to the control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> so as to stop the switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a comparator having a hysteresis function, and when the switching operation is stopped and the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>decreases, that is, the voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> decreases, the comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> outputs a signal to the control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> so as to resume the switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. By repeating the foregoing operation, the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> stabilizes the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows a time chart on the operation of stabilizing the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. At time t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are ON and the switches S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are OFF, and the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is started to be applied, the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes charged, and the potential of the electrode C&plus; of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>. Next, at time t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are OFF and the switches S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are ON, and the potential of the electrode C&plus; of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes 2V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, a charge to the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is started, and the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>comes to be increased. At time t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the respective switches are in the conditions identical to those at the time t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, and the potential of the electrode C&plus; of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>again. At time t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the respective switches are in the conditions identical to those at the time t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and the potential of the electrode C&plus; of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes 2V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, and the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> becomes charged. In a period from the time t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to the time t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, since an output current flows from the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a load, a discharge from the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is carried out, and the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is increased by repeating such a charge and a discharge to and from the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in a predetermined duty. When the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>reaches a predetermined threshold level COM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, when the voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at the point connecting the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> outputs a signal for stopping the switching operation to the control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Suppose that this occurs at time t<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are ON and the switches S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are OFF at the time t<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, and the condition is maintained. After the time t<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>continues to be decreased until it declines to a predetermined threshold level COM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where the comparator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> outputs a signal for starting the switching operation to the control section <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Suppose that this occurs at time t<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, the switches S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are OFF and the switches S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are ON at the time t<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, and the switching operation is started. In such a manner, the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> shifts from start-up state to steady state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in the foregoing conventional stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, when the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>increases very steeply, there is a possibility that the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>might overshoot and some load connected to the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> might fail to function properly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a switched-capacitor-type stabilized power unit which can prevent an overshoot of an output voltage at start-up, in a structure having an output capacitor which outputs a charged voltage obtained through a plurality of charges by switching operation utilizing a voltage-increasing potential of a voltage-increasing capacitor at the start-up, as the output voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To achieve the foregoing object, a stabilized power unit of the present invention is a switched-capacitor-type stabilized power unit structured so as to include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> an voltage-increasing capacitor which is charged based on an input voltage and whose voltage is increased after being charged; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> switching section for carrying out switching operation to alternately switch a charge period and a voltage-increasing period of the voltage-increasing capacitor; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> an output capacitor which outputs a charged voltage obtained by being charged utilizing a voltage-increasing potential of the voltage-increasing capacitor in the voltage-increasing period, as an output voltage, and stabilizes the charged voltage within a range of the output voltage in steady state through a plurality of the voltage-increasing periods after a start-up is started, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> wherein the stabilized power unit includes soft start means for controlling the switching section to carry out the switching operation so that the charged voltage always becomes not more than the output voltage in the steady state, at the start-up from when the start-up is started until when the charged voltage is stabilized within the range of the output voltage in the steady state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the foregoing invention, at the start-up, the soft start means controls the switching section to carry out the switching operation so that the charged voltage of the output capacitor always becomes not more than the output voltage in the steady state. With this structure, the charged voltage of the output capacitor becomes stabilized within the range of the output voltage in the steady state, without having an overshoot until the completion of the start-up. Consequently, it becomes possible to provide a switched-capacitor-type stabilized power unit which can prevent an overshoot of the output voltage at the start-up, in the structure having the output capacitor which outputs the charged voltage obtained through a plurality of charges by the switching operation utilizing a voltage-increasing potential of the voltage-increasing capacitor, as an output voltage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a capacitor which is charged in accordance with the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, and whose voltage is increased after the charge. The input capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a capacitor which is charged by a power source provided outside the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and applies the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>to the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a capacitor outputting the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>obtained by a charge utilizing a voltage-increasing potential in the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, specifically, the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>obtained by the charge in accordance with a potential difference between the voltage-increasing potential at the electrode C&plus; and a GND potential in a structure in which the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel with a circuit including the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the input capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are connected in series, via the output terminal T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, while the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is being charged, the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>continues to be applied to the input capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constitute a voltage-dividing circuit for the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, and the divided voltage of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>at the connecting point between the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, that is, the detected value, is inputted to the feedback terminal T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the integrated portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, on a path between the output terminal T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for connecting or cutting off the path are provided in series, with the switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided on the side of the output terminal T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Besides, on a path between the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a GND line inside the integrated portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, switches S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for connecting or cutting off the path are provided in series, with the switch S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided on the side of the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, a connecting point between the switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the capacitor connection terminal T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a connecting point between the switch S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the switch S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to the capacitor connection terminal T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. A switched capacitor section is constituted by the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, a control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided for controlling ON state (connected state) and OFF state (cut-off state) of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputs a signal a which makes the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> ON or OFF simultaneously, and outputs a signal b which makes the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ON or OFF simultaneously. With this arrangement, the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> carry out switching operation for switching the ON state and the OFF state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The switching operation alternately switches a charge period in which the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are ON and the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are OFF, and the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged by the application of the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, and a voltage-increasing period in which the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are OFF and the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are ON, and a voltage is increased in the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a charge from the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is carried out. In the charge period, the voltage of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is determined by the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>and the length of the charge period. In the voltage-increasing period, the potential of the electrode C&minus; of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases from a GND potential to a potential of the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the potential of the electrode C&plus; increases by the potential increase at the electrode C&minus;, and thus the voltage is increased. In the voltage-increasing period in steady state, the potential of the electrode C&plus; becomes 2V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>. Consequently, the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is charged in accordance with the application of the voltage 2V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>. The output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs a charged voltage obtained by being charged by the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, a comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided so as to input a signal c for determining timing to start or stop the switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A non-reversal input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the feedback terminal T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a reversal input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to a DC voltage source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided so as to generate and input a reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a hysteresis function, and compares the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inputted from the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the non-reversal input terminal via the feedback terminal T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inputted to the reversal input terminal. When the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the signal c which gives an instruction to stop the switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> decreases by a predetermined value than the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the signal c which gives an instruction to start the switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The foregoing predetermined value may be constant during the operation of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or may vary at the respective points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Before the start-up of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are all OFF under the control of the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the start-up is started, the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> controls so that the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> become ON and the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> become OFF, and the switching operation is started from the charge period. Then, by the switching operation of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> after the start of the start-up, the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comes to be stabilized within a range of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state after a plurality of the voltage-increasing periods, regardless of whether the switching operation is stopped by the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or not. The switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the DC voltage source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constitute a switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serves as switching means for carrying out the switching operation alternately switching the charge period and the voltage-increasing period of the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The integrated portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is further provided with a soft start circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The soft start circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> serves as soft start means for controlling the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to carry out the switching operation so that, at the start-up from when the start-up is started until when the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is stabilized within the range of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state, the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> always becomes not more than the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Up to this point, the structure of the integrated portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, the following description will explain the operation of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the foregoing structure. First, when the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is inputted to the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the input capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the start-up is started, the signal a outputted from the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> makes the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> ON, and the signal b outputted from the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> makes the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> OFF. With this arrangement, the charge period is started, and the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes charged. Next, the signal a outputted from the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> makes the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> OFF, and the signal b outputted from the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> makes the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ON, which switches the charge period to the voltage-increasing period in which the voltage is increased in the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes charged, and the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is applied to the load. Afterwards, by alternately switching the charge period and the voltage-increasing period, the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, that is, the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, becomes stabilized at the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state. Here, under the control by the soft start circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> carries out the switching operation at the start-up so that the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> always becomes not more than the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state, so as to realize soft start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Besides, after the start-up is started, the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is detected by the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the connecting point between the voltage-dividing resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inputted as the detected value to the non-reversal input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the feedback terminal T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> compares the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the DC voltage source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the start-up is started, the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lower than the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a predetermined value, and the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the signal c which gives an instruction to start the switching operation to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and thus the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> carries out the switching operation. As the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>increases, the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases and reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the signal c which gives an instruction to stop the switching operation to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and thus the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> stops the switching operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After the switching operation is stopped, the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>decreases due to power supply to the load, and when the feedback voltage V<highlight><subscript>fb</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes lower than the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a predetermined value, the comparator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the signal c which gives an instruction to start the switching operation to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> carries out the switching operation again. By repeating the foregoing process, the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comes to be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present embodiment, since the soft start circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided, the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes stabilized within the range of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state, without having an overshoot until the completion of the start-up. Consequently, the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can prevent an overshoot of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>at the start-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, the following examples will explain specific structures of the soft start circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in detail. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in which a duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided as the soft start circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Along with this, the integrated portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as an integrated portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated by using the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>inputted from the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a source voltage. Further, the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the DC voltage source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is inputted to the duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs a control signal d to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, using the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> controls the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to carry out the switching operation so that there is a constant cycle between the start of a charge period and the start of the next charge period. When starting up the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> makes the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> gradually increase a duty in the charge period in the foregoing cycle, by the foregoing control signal d. Here, the duty is gradually increased to a predetermined value, that is, so that the charge period is gradually prolonged to a predetermined value, so as to prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start-up. Since the rush current is prevented from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is gradually charged in the voltage-increasing period. This structure can easily prevent an overshoot of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>at the start-up. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Upon start of the start-up of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the constant current source I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates a constant current from the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>inputted from the terminal T<highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, and flows the constant current to the point p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged by the flowing in of the constant current, and a charge amount is increased with time. When the charged voltage of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reaches Zener voltage of the Zener diode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not charged any more, and the constant current flows via the Zener diode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The Zener voltage is set higher than the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. With this structure, a voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the point p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a GND increases with time by the inclination of I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, where I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the constant current and C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a capacity of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and is inputted to one of the non-reversal input terminals of the PWM comparator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>.

In this manner, the constant current source I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Zener diode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>constitute charge amount changing means for increasing the charge amount of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with time at the start-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Besides, as shown in a time chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the oscillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>generates a triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>having a predetermined frequency, and the PWM comparator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>outputs the control signal d which gives an instruction to set a period in which the lower voltage of the two voltages, the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is higher than the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>as the charge period, and a period in which the lower voltage is lower than the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>as the voltage-increasing period, to the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lower than the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the period in which the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is higher than the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>becomes longer with the increase of the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the charge period in which the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are ON and the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are OFF is gradually prolonged, and the foregoing duty is gradually increased. In other words, soft start can be realized. After the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes lower than the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the period in which the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is higher than the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>is constant, therefore the charge period and the voltage-increasing period become constant. Consequently, by setting the point where the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the point where the start-up is completed, the charge period becomes constant after the completion of the start-up, and the charge period (duty) in steady state can be obtained. In this manner, the PWM comparator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>determines the charge period and the voltage-increasing period at the start-up and in steady state, in accordance with the charge amount of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Consequently, according to the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provided with the duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> structured as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines the charge period at the star-up in accordance with the charge amount of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increased with time by the charge amount changing means, and thus the duty adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can easily prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start up. In addition, it is also possible to provide charge amount changing means for decreasing the charge amount of a capacitor with time at the start-up, instead of the constant current source I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Zener diode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and to determine the charge period in accordance with the charge amount of the capacitor whose charge amount is decreased with time by discharge. When using a PWM comparator, it is possible to set a period in which a voltage height relationship is opposite to the foregoing case, for example, in which the voltage of the capacitor is higher than the reference voltage and lower than the triangular wave voltage (it is satisfactory even when the voltage of the capacitor does not change linearly with respect to time), as the charge period at the start-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Besides, in the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the less the increasing inclination of the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is, the more slowly the duty increases, which can provide slower soft start. Since the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is increased by I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&times;t, where t denotes time since the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is started to be charged by the constant current, the charge period can be adjusted by adjusting the capacity of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Such a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a desired type may be externally attached to the integrated portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and thus it becomes possible to freely set how to change the charge period at the start-up. </paragraph>

Upon start of the start-up of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>starts counting the number of the triangular waves generated by the oscillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and when the number of oscillations reaches a predetermined value, the clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>outputs a signal e giving an instruction which of the switches S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, . . . , Sn should be ON (in connected state), to the switch circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>.

Here, at the start-up of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>outputs the signal g so as to make the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to carry out oscillation at the highest oscillation frequency during when the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is lower than the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and so as to make the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to carry out oscillation at the second highest oscillation frequency when the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> increases and reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The comparator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>compares the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inputted to the non-reversal input terminal with the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>inputted to the reversal input terminal, and outputs the control signal f in accordance with the voltage height relationship between the two voltages.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, as the oscillation frequency of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>becomes lower in such a manner that, after the start of the start-up, the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is being charged, and when the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> reaches the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the frequency of the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>becomes lower, the period in which the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is higher than the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>is gradually prolonged, and thus the charge period is gradually prolonged. After the completion of the start-up, the oscillation frequency of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>becomes constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> structured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> includes the above-mentioned oscillation means, and determines the charge period at the start-up based on the oscillation frequency. Since the charge period at the start-up is determined based on the oscillation frequency of the oscillation means which carries out oscillation with varying with time from a high frequency to a low frequency, it becomes possible to easily prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the oscillation frequency of the oscillation means at the start-up is changed based on the charge amount of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> whose charge amount is increased with time by the charge amount changing means, it becomes possible to prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start-up more easily. Incidentally, as in Example 1, it is possible to provide charge amount changing means for decreasing the charge amount of a capacitor with time at the start-up, instead of the constant current source I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the Zener diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Besides, in the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the less the increasing inclination of the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is, the longer the interval of the timing that the oscillation frequency of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>switches from a high frequency to a low frequency is, which can provide slower soft start. Since the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is increased by I<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&times;t, where t denotes time since the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is started to be charged by the constant current, the charge period can be adjusted by adjusting the capacity of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a desired type may be externally attached to the integrated portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and thus it becomes possible to freely set how to change the charge period at the start-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, the charge period is gradually prolonged with time by the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> so as to prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start-up, and the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> controls the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the start-up to carry out the switching operation such that the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is always not more than the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows another structure of the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a circuit which is provided with the terminal T<highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> from which the control signal f is outputted, and a terminal T<highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> to which a reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a DC voltage source (not shown) provided together with the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is inputted, but which does not have a terminal to which the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is inputted, and includes an oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, and a clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>has one non-reversal input terminal and one reversal input terminal: the non-reversal input terminal is connected to the terminal T<highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, and the reversal input terminal is connected to an output terminal of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. An input terminal of the clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is connected to an output terminal of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and an output terminal of the clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is connected to an oscillation frequency control terminal of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. An output terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is connected to the terminal T<highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The comparator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>compares the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> inputted to the non-reversal input terminal with the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc </subscript></highlight>of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>inputted to the reversal input terminal, and outputs the control signal f in accordance with the voltage height relationship between the reference voltage V<highlight><subscript>ref</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the triangular wave voltage V<highlight><subscript>osc</subscript></highlight>. The control signal f is structured the same as the one used in the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>counts the number of oscillations of a triangular wave outputted from the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and outputs a signal h for changing the oscillation frequency of the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>from a high frequency to a low frequency, to the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, whenever the count reaches a predetermined threshold. Thus, soft start as shown in the time chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the oscillator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>constitute oscillation means for carrying out oscillation with the oscillation frequency changed from high to low with time at the start-up. Besides, the clock counter circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>serves as counting means for counting the number of oscillations of the oscillation means. Since the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> detects the passage of time by counting the number of oscillations of the oscillation means at the start-up by the counting means, and changes the oscillation frequency of the oscillation means based on the detected passage of time, it becomes possible to prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start-up more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, the charge period is gradually prolonged with time by the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> so as to prevent a rush current from flowing into the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start-up, and the oscillation frequency adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> controls the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the start-up to carry out the switching operation such that the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is always not more than the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>in steady state. </paragraph>

Along with this, the integrated portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> as an integrated portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Besides, each of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a first switch for connecting a path for charging the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the charge period, and for cutting off the path for charging the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the voltage-increasing period, and at least one of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is constituted by a field-effect transistor (hereinafter referred to as a MOSFET). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The gate voltage adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is operated by using the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>inputted from the input terminal T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a source voltage, and controls the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) by adjusting the signal a outputted from the control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for operating the MOSFET, that is, the signal for supplying a gate voltage for the MOSFET, so as to be a signal a&prime;. More specifically, at the start-up, in order to prevent a rush current from flowing in the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the voltage-increasing period, a channel resistance when the MOSFET is conducting, here, in the charge period, is gradually decreased from a higher value by adjusting the gate voltage, so as to gradually increase a final charged voltage charged to the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the respective charge periods having an identical length, with the passage of time since the start of the start-up. Here, suppose that the signal b is not adjusted. In this manner, the gate voltage adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> controls the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to carry out the switching operation so as to exercise channel resistance control for decreasing the channel resistance with time when at least one MOSFET is conducting, for the purpose of preventing a rush current from flowing into the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the start-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Through the control of the gate voltage adjustment circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the switching section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is gradually charged at the start-up. Consequently, this structure can easily prevent an overshoot of the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>at the start-up. Besides, since no rush current flows, the current rating of the MOSFET can be set lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in the foregoing example, at least one of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is defined as a MOSFET, but the present invention is not limited to this. Each of the switches S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a second switch for cutting off a path for charging the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the charge period, and for connecting the path for charging the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the voltage-increasing period, and it is satisfactory that at least one of the first switch and the second switch, or at least one of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment, is a MOSFET. The MOSFET provided as the second switch prevents a current flowing into the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in each voltage-increasing period from becoming a rush current directly. </paragraph>

Therefore, even when predetermined, constant charge period and voltage-increasing period are repeated, the channel resistance of the MOSFET in the charge period decreases with time, and in steady state reached after a sufficient passage of time, the voltage V<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> becomes virtually zero and the channel resistance is minimized. Consequently, in an initial stage of the start-up where the channel resistance is high, the voltage-increasing capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is gradually charged in the charge period and the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also gradually charged, and as the channel resistance decreases, the charge amount in the charge period is increased, and the charged voltage of the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also increased. After the operation of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is stopped, the operation of the constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also stopped, and the accumulated charge in the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is discharged. </paragraph>

Upon start of the start-up of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>generates a constant voltage V<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the input voltage V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>for output. The signal a inputted from the terminal T<highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight> after the start-up of the stabilized power unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is started is originally a switching signal constituted by a pulse corresponding to the switching operation, together with the signal b.
