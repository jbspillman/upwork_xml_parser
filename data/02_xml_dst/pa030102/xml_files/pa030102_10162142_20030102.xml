<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An ice fishing net comprises an elongate handle having a gripping portion for grasping by a user and a net rim assembly attached to the handle. The net rim assembly includes first and second semicircular rim members with the first rim member fixedly mounted relative to the handle and the second rim member rotatably mounted relative to the first rim member and rotatable from a first position to a second position to form a substantially circular rim. A trigger assembly selectively allows the second rim member to rotate from a first position to a second position. Netting material is secured to the first and second rim members to form a net for receiving a fish therein when the second rim member is its second position. A biasing device forces the second rim member from the first position to the second position when released by the trigger assembly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of the invention relates generally to nets used for recreational fishing, and more specifically, to a fishing net configured for use when ice fishing to retrieve fish from a hole that has been bored through a layer of ice that has formed on a lake or other body of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ice fishing is becoming more and more popular among avid fisherman in the United States and Canada where the climate permits such activity during the winter months. Ice fishing has become a popular leisure activity for many men and women, commonly collectively referred to as anglers, who enjoy fishing during the warmer months and desire to fish when the weather turns cold and lakes and reservoirs freeze. Such fishing conditions, however, present their own unique problems and challenges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A typical setup for an ice fishing angler includes a fishing pole to which a reel containing fishing line is attached. The line is fed through several eyelets attached to the length of the pole at spaced intervals. To the free end of the line, an angler will attach a lure or a hook and attach bait to the hook. In order to access the depths of a frozen pond or lake and thus to get the lure or bait to the fish, the angler must drill or have drilled a hole through the layer of ice. The hole must be of sufficient diameter to not only enter the bait or lure into the water but to retrieve any fish that may be caught. As such, typical hole diameters are 6, 8 or 10 inches. Once the hole is drilled through the ice, the angler can lower the bait or lure through the hole and into the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Once a fish is caught, the fish must be retrieved through the hole. Such a feat is often difficult as it is usually necessary to maintain proper tension on the line so that it does not exceed the breaking strength of the line or allow slack in the line which may allow the fish to free itself from the hook (especially when barbless hooks are used). In addition, once the fish leaves the water, the weight of the fish alone may exceed the breaking strength of the line. As such, anglers typically employ a retrieving device, such as a hand held net, to help retrieve the fish once it has been brought to within reaching distance of the angler. With respect to ice fishing, such nets must be configured to fit within the ice fishing hole. The hole itself is typically a cylindrically shaped bore extending one or more feet through the ice, depending on the thickness of the ice. As such, typical fishing nets which have sizes larger than the ice fishing hole are not useful as their size prevents them from being inserted into the hole. Furthermore, smaller nets that may be insertable into the ice fishing hole are not configured to fill the entire diameter of the hole to prevent a fish from falling between the wall of the ice fishing hole and the frame of the fishing net. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When ice fishing, an angler typically employs the use of a gas powered auger which is capable of boring a hole into the ice. As such, the hole will have a diameter corresponding to the diameter of the auger used. As discussed, such augers come standard in sizes ranging from about six inches in diameter to ten inches in diameter. Because the fishing hole often has a standard diameter and most anglers utilize a single auger having a particular size, it is possible to configure an ice fishing net for fitting within a particular diameter ice hole. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,872, an apparatus for retrieving fish caught while ice fishing is disclosed in which a support member is mounted to a base member that is supported by the upper surface of an ice layer. The support member is extended and retracted through the ice hole and is operative to support a fish during such motion. An extension and retrieval mechanism, such as a slide rod interconnecting the base and support member whereby a fish caught on a fishing line may be maneuvered to the ice hole, and onto the support member and supported during upward movement through the ice hole. The support member may be pivoted out of alignment with the ice hole so as not to obstruct the lower opening thereto, and biased against the ice layer lower opening thereto, and biased against the ice layer lower surface in a ready position. An adjustable limit stop accommodates ice layers of varied thicknesses. The base member is preferably a circular collar, and the support member a pan element with drain holes. A major problem with the foregoing apparatus for retrieving fish while ice fishing is that the pan must be inserted below the ice layer and thus must include a sufficiently long handle to extend a required amount into the ice hole. Furthermore, the device can only be used in one hole as the device is mounted to the ice layer. Additionally, when used in lakes where the depth of the ice may be several feet, the size of the device may become cumbersome to maneuver and operate. Moreover, the ability of the fisherman to both hold tension in the fishing line while retrieving the fish and to maneuver the device is likely to be quite difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A similar device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,722,940 in which a stationary tube is attached along a side of the hole in the ice supports a rod having a handle at its upper end and a horizontal gate plate at its lower end. The rod is pivotable by the handle so as to swing the gate into a closed position at the bottom end of the hole, and the plate is then movable upwardly so to bring the fish to the top end of the hole in the ice. As with the aforementioned patent, the device of the U.S. Pat. No. 3,722,940 patent requires the device to be secured to the ice hole and extend to the bottom of the layer of ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Several other ice nets and ice skimmers have been developed that do not require the device to be lowered below the layer of ice. In the alternative, devices such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,289,850, 3,856,787 and 5,140,767 teach the use of a plate or scoop that can be actuated to a closed position once the device is lowered into the ice hole. U.S. Pat. No. 3,289,850 discloses an ice skimmer in which the skimmer is pivotally connect to a handle. Because it is often desirable to remove ice that forms in the ice hole, ice skimmers are used to keep the ice hole clear for easier fish removal. The skimmer shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,289,850 is lowered into the ice hole with the skimmer lying against the handle. Once the skimmer is lowered and the handle is pulled upwardly out of the ice hole, it is intended that the skimmer will open to fill the hole to remove ice in the ice hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A similar device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,787 in which an ice skimmer includes a mechanically actuated skimmer. The skimmer of U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,787 employs the use of an handle which can be actuated to manipulate the skimmer. Thus, once lowered into the ice hole in a vertical position, the skimmer can be rotated to a horizontal position and then lifted to remove the ice from the ice hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The ice net of U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,767 operates similarly to the skimmer of U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,787 in that an actuatable handle is utilized to close the ice net once a fish is positioned above a scoop in the ice hole. In the open position (i.e., when the scoop is in a vertical position), the scoop will necessary obstruct a substantial portion of the ice hole. That is, for a scoop having a diameter close to the diameter of the ice hole, the scoop will necessarily be positioned away from the side wall of the ice hole thus reducing the effective diameter of the hole as the ice net is lowered pass the fish. As the fish is typically moving to try to free itself, the lower end of the ice scoop can actually impinge upon the fish at the point of the hook and dislodge the hook from the fish thus freeing the fish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide an ice fishing net that does not have to be inserted into an ice hole completely through the layer of ice to be operable. It would also be advantageous to provide an ice fishing net that provides little obstruction in the ice hole when inserted therein so that the net can pass by a fish in an ice hole held on a line by an angler without dislodging the fish from the line. It would still be a further advantage to provide an ice fishing net that is operable with one hand so that the angler can hold a fishing pole with one hand and maneuver and operate the fishing net with the other hand. These and other advantages will become apparent from a reading of the following description of the preferred embodiments of an ice fishing net in accordance with the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an ice fishing net that is self actuating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide an ice fishing net that is self supporting in a standing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an ice fishing net that can service multiple holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an ice fishing net that can enter the hole while the fish is in the hole, bypass the fish and prevent the fish from exiting the bottom of the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide an ice fishing net that does not require the angler to put his or her hands in the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these and other objects herein discussed, as well as those that will be understood to one of skill in the art upon review of the present invention, an ice fishing net in accordance with the principles of the present invention comprises an elongate handle having a distal end and a proximal end and a net assembly connected to the handle proximate the distal end. The net assembly has a first rim portion fixedly mounted relative to the handle, a second rim portion pivotally mounted relative to the first rim portion, and a net supported by the first and second rim portions. The second rim portion is biased to rotate from a first position to a second position. A trigger assembly is connected to the handle and linked to the second rim portion for holding the first rim portion in the first position and for selectively releasing the first rim portion to allow it to rotate from the first position to the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The handle preferably comprises an elongate tube. The trigger assembly preferably comprises a release lever coupled to an elongate rod within the elongate tube. The rod has a proximal end coupled to the release lever for rotation of the rod and a distal end having a release arm for grasping the second rim portion when the second rim portion is in the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the elongate handle is comprised of a tube and has a first portion having a first longitudinal axis and a second portion having a second longitudinal axis. The first longitudinal axis and the second longitudinal axis have an angle between them such that a bend is formed in the handle for easier single handed use by an angler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The trigger assembly preferably includes a biasing member coupled to a slidable member within the handle for biasing the slidable member toward the proximal end of the handle. A release pin is inserted through a hole in the handle and is capable of holding the slidable member away from the proximal end of the handle. Releasing the pin, releases the slidable member to allow the slidable member to slide toward the proximal end of the handle as it is pulled by the biasing member. A cable, wire or other such member is coupled between the second rim portion and the slidable member so that movement of the slidable member toward the proximal end of the handle rotates the second rim portion to the second position. </paragraph>

That is, the release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be pulled toward the gripping handle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to release the net portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The release mechanism, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is housed within the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and comprises the release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is pivotally connected relative to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) as will be described in more detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The net portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is comprised of a netting material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is mounted to first and second rim portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The netting material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be attached to the rim portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as with an elongate segment of webbing material interwoven through the netting material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and secured to the rim as with rivets or other types of fasteners known in the art. For the rim portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the netting material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be threaded directly onto the rim portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the top edge of the netting material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> engages the rim portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The first rim portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted relative to the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the second rim portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted relative to the first rim portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second rim portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is illustrated in an open position, that is, in a position in which the net is open to receive a fish therein. When in the open position, the first and second rim members, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively, form a hoop preferably having a diameter near the diameter of the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is being fished. Of course, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the diameter of the hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be greater than the diameter of the hoop formed by the first and second rim members, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> respectively, and still be effective in retrieving a fish from an ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Having the hoop diameter close to the diameter of the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, however, reduces the possibility that a fish could fit between the hoop formed by the first and second rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the wall of the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> To provide additional support for the first rim member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a support frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is attached to and between the first rim member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is comprised of first and second upright frame members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively, and semicircular frame member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is spaced above the first rim member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and attached to the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The support frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> helps to prevent the first and second rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from pivoting relative to the distal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when a fish is contained in the net <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> illustrate top and side views of the rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> relative to an ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is rotatable between a first position (indicated in solid lines) and a second position (indicated in dashed lines). When the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in a first position, the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be rotated so as to retain the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the first position by resting against a first rim retaining member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which depends from the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and extends inwardly therefrom at a first side <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> thereof. In the first position, the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is biased away from the rim member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as with a biasing member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The biasing member may comprise a coil spring secured relative to the point of rotation of the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As such, the biasing member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a first arm <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which abuts against the frame member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a second arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which abuts against the first side <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to swing the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from its first position to its second position. As such, when the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is rotated from a first position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> to a second position (i.e., rotated inwardly) so that the retaining member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> no longer engages the rim retaining member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will swing from the first position to the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the rim <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in the first position, the rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are substantially concentric and have substantially similar diameters. As such, with the net <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> attached (se <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) the net will only lie in half of the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the net will hang against one half of the side wall of the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in the second position, the rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> form a circular rim member that substantially fills the ice hole. With the net <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> attached, it would be quite difficult for a fish to fit between the rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as with hollow cylindrical post members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with circular bores <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, respectively, for fitting over and pivotally attaching relative to the post members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The coil spring <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is positioned within the cylindrical post <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and is retained therein with the arm members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which extend out from the cylindrical post <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In order to form a free standing fisting net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a rear standing member or leg <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached to the rim <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> near its longitudinal center. The leg <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached so as to have a length substantially equal to the distance between the second side <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the distal end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As such, the distal ends of the frame members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) and the leg <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> form three legs or a tripod for supporting the net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a free standing position. Thus, when the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is loaded, i.e., held in its first position, the net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be stood next to the ice hole for quick access by an angler when the net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> swings to its second position, an abutment member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is rigidly attached to the frame member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> prevents the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from swinging past a horizontal position. That is, because the biasing device <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> encourages the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to rotate away from the rim member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from a first position to a second position and because it is desirable that when the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in its second position the effective diameter of the first and second rim members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> be maximized, the abutment member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> prevents the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from over rotating. In addition, when the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates to the second position, the force of the biasing device <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> would have to be sufficiently strong enough to not only support the weight of the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in its second position but a fish contained in the net. Accordingly, a rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from rotating back toward the first position after the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has rotated to the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is comprised of an elongate plate that is formed from a flexible material such as a sheet of spring steel. The rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is attache to the rim member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) proximate its proximal end <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> as with bore <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and a fastener as is known in the art for attaching such components. The rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is formed with two bends <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> proximate its distal end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to form a ramp portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and an abutment portion <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. When the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates to its second position, the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will first engage the ramp portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> causing the rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to bend in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> allowing the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to slide up the ramp portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> until it passes the bend <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. At that point, the rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will return to its pre-bent position. When a weight is applied to the rim <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as when a fish is present in the net, the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will rest upon the abutment portion <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to hold the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in its second position. To return the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to its first position, the rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be manually bent in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to allow the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be rotated passed the abutment portion <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> illustrate the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is configured to retain the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in a first or &ldquo;loaded&rdquo; position. The rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends from proximate the handle assembly to the net assembly through the handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). The rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is held relative to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with bracket member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> secured to the wall <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> stabilizes the proximal end of the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is secured relative to the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to substantially prevent vertical movement of the rod while allowing rotation of the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> relative to the bracket. Such an attachment may be accomplished with threaded fasteners <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> threaded onto threads formed in the proximal end <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that other means of fastening the bracket to the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while allowing rotation of the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> relative thereto may also be employed. Proximate the distal end <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a bend <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed in the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to form the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A collar <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is attached proximate the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and is positioned within the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the when the net is assembled. The collar <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> helps to longitudinally align the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> proximate the distal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> causes rotation of the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from a first position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> where the release arm is able to hold the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in its first position to a second position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> where the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allows the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to swing to its second position. </paragraph>

The release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A first bracket member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is attached to the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and includes a first bore <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> there through for attached to a second bracket member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> secured to the wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A pin or threaded fastener <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> secures the first bracket member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the second bracket member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> while allowing free rotation of the first bracket member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> relative to the second bracket member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the release lever has a first portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with an S-like configuration. This allows the proximal portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which is configured for grasping by the angler to lie beneath the handle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that the proximal portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be pulled toward the handle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The distal portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from the first portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for attachment of the bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as well as attachment of the to a rod pivoting member <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As better illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the rod pivoting member <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a rectangular or elongate configuration and includes a first bore <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for being secured relative to the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a second bore <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> for receiving the distal end <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the distal portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Because the rod pivoting member <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted relative to the rod and pivotally attached proximate to the distal end <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, rotating the release lever toward the handle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will cause the distal end <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the release lever to move away from the handle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Such movement of the distal end <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will thus cause the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to rotate resulting in rotation of the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at the distal end of the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to allow the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to swing from a first position to a second position as discussed herein. A biasing member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is coupled between the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to bias the release lever and thus the rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a position where the release arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can engage with the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to hold it in a first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To get the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into a ready position (i.e., a first position) when the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is already in its released or second position, the rim engaging member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is flexed away from the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be rotated to its first position. The release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is then pulled toward the handle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to position the rim retaining member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for engagement with the arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Releasing the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will cause the arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to rotate to a position of engagement with the retaining member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and position the leg <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> beneath the handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When a fish is caught by the angler and the angler can reel the fish into the ice hole, the angler can insert the net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with one hand into the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and hold on to the fishing pole with the other hand. Because the net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a loaded state forms a crescent shaped net structure (i.e., the net and supporting structure lies against the wall of the ice hole along one side thereof) the net can be inserted into the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> passed the fish without interfering with the fish or the fishing line. Once the net <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the rim <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is below the fish, pulling the release lever or trigger will cause the second rim member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to quickly rotate to a second position and open the net <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for receiving the fish therein. The ice fishing net <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can then be lifted from the ice hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with the fish safely secured therein. </paragraph>
