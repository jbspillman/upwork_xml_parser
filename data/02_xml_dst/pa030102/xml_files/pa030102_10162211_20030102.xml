<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a GaN-based semiconductor element, such as a GaN-based blue-violet semiconductor laser element, a GaN-based light emitting diode element capable of emitting light in the ultraviolet to red regions, or a GaN-based high frequency electronic device, and to a GaN-based compound semiconductor epitaxially-grown wafer used for forming such a semiconductor element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A nitride semiconductor containing nitrogen (N) as a group V element has a relatively large band gap and is thus considered a promising material of a short-wavelength light emitting element. Particularly, a gallium nitride (GaN)-based compound semiconductor represented by the general formula Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>N (where 0&lE;x, y, z&lE;1, x&plus;y&plus;z&equals;1) has been actively researched, and a blue light emitting diode (LED) element and a green light emitting diode element have already been put into practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Moreover, there is a strong demand for a blue-violet semiconductor laser element having an oscillation wavelength near 400 nm as a light source for a next-generation high-density optical disk such as an HD-DVD (High Definition Digital Versatile Disk), and semiconductor laser elements using a gallium nitride-based semiconductor material has been actively researched and developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an enlarged perspective view illustrating a portion of an epitaxially-grown wafer (hereinafter referred to simply as &ldquo;epi-wafer&rdquo;) used in a conventional gallium nitride-based compound semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the orientation of the principal surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride (GaN) has an off-angle of 0.2&deg; in the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction with respect to the (0001) plane. An element layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> made of an epitaxially-grown gallium nitride-based semiconductor is formed on the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The surface morphology of the element layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is influenced by steps (not shown) on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and has a plurality of steps appearing in the same direction (&equals;&lt;1-100&gt; direction). Thus, a plurality of steps are formed in the direction in which the off-angle is provided to the orientation of the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Note that in the present specification, the negative symbol &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; attached to an index of an orientation or crystal zone axis is used herein for the sake of convenience to represent the inversion of the index that follows the negative symbol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a case where a semiconductor laser element is produced by using such an epi-wafer, it is produced so that the laser resonance direction in a cavity of a waveguide and the step direction (&equals;&lt;1-100&gt; direction) are substantially perpendicular to each other. If the resonance direction of the cavity (stripe direction) is aligned with the step direction of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (off-angle direction), the end surfaces of the cavity opposing each other are shifted from each other in height due to the steps, thereby increasing the internal loss (waveguide loss). This increases the threshold current of the laser element, whereby the reliability is also lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-156348 describes a GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer in which an element layer is formed, wherein the element layer has steps in which the width of a flat portion (terrace portion) between adjacent steps is on the order of 100 to 1000 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the publication, the resonance direction is set to be parallel to the step direction so as to allow for cleavage along the (1-100) M plane of GaN. Therefore, the width of the terrace portion needs to be at least large enough to be cut out as a chip, i.e., to be larger than the length of one side of the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, with the GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer of the publication, the off-angle needs to be very small, i.e., about 0.3&deg; to 0.5&deg;, so as to form a terrace portion that is large enough to obtain a laser chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since the off-angle cannot be larger than 1&deg;, for example, the surface morphology of the epi-wafer may deteriorate, and the half-width of the X-ray rocking curve, which is an index of the orientation of a crystal, may increase, thereby failing to obtain an element layer having a high crystallinity. Therefore, a semiconductor device produced by using the conventional GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer will have insufficient characteristics. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention, which has been made to solve the problems in the prior art, has an object to obtain a high crystallinity in an epitaxial layer (element layer) of a GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer having an off-angle. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor element of the present invention, the element layer has a surface morphology of a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the predetermined direction, in which the off-angle is provided, whereby the width between stripes will not be narrowed even if the off-angle of the substrate is set to be as large as 1&deg; or more. Therefore, the element layer has a desirable surface morphology, and an element layer having a good crystallinity can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor element of the present invention, it is preferred that the predetermined direction is a crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor element of the present invention, it is preferred that the off-angle is equal to or greater than 1&deg; and less than or equal to 10&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the semiconductor element of the present invention is a laser element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In such a case, it is preferred that the laser element includes a cavity formed to be substantially parallel to the predetermined direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In such a case, it is preferred that: the off-angle is equal to or greater than 1&deg; and less than or equal to 10&deg;; and end surfaces of the cavity are formed by cleavage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an enlarged perspective view illustrating a portion of a GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer according to the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment includes a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride (GaN) which, in terms of crystal system, belongs to the hexagonal system and whose principal surface is inclined by an off-angle of 5&deg; in the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction with respect to the (0001) plane, and an element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for forming a semiconductor element, which is made of a GaN-based compound semiconductor belonging to the hexagonal system, and which is epitaxially grown by using a metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) method, or the like, on the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The surface morphology of the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction, and the interval between the stripes is about 10 &mgr;m to 20 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Note that although the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not limited to a liquid phase growth, a vapor phase growth or a solid phase growth, it is herein formed by, for example, a high-temperature high-pressure method, an MOVPE method, a hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) method, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A measurement of the X-ray rocking curve of the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has confirmed that the half-width thereof is about <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> seconds or less. In a conventional epi-wafer, the off-angle of the principal surface is smaller than 1&deg;, as described above, and the half-width of the X-ray rocking curve is about 200 seconds to 300 seconds. Thus, it can be seen that the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment has a significantly improved crystallinity as compared with the conventional epi-wafer having an off-angle smaller than 1&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It has been confirmed that if the off-angle of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride is set to be about on the order of 1 degree, e.g., to be equal to or greater than 1&deg; and less than or equal to 10&deg;, the surface morphology of the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> epitaxially grown on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the &lt;1-100&gt; direction, which is the off-angle direction, whereby the crystallinity of the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is significantly improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Note that while an MOVPE method is used as an epitaxial growth method for forming the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this. The present invention can of course be realized by using other epitaxial growth methods, e.g., a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method, or an HVPE method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a portion of a GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer according to the second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of a GaN-based compound semiconductor of the second embodiment is an epitaxial layer having a semiconductor laser structure capable of emitting violet light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a structure in which an n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN, an n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of n-type aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), an n-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN, a multiple quantum well (MQW) active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> including well layers made of indium nitride (InGaN) and barrier layers made of GaN that are layered together, a p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN, a p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> made of p-type GaN, a p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN, and a p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> made of p-type GaN, are layered in this order, by epitaxial growth, on the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride (GaN) whose principal surface is inclined by an off-angle of about <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction with respect to the (0001) plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> confine carriers injected into the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and recombined light caused by the carriers, and the n-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> improve the efficiency of confining the carriers and the recombined light. Moreover, the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> functions as a barrier layer for preventing electrons injected from the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from leaking to the p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, instead of being injected into the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The resonance direction (longitudinal direction) of the cavity is set to be a direction perpendicular to the M plane, which is a crystal face of gallium nitride, i.e., the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction, so that the cleaved end surface of the cavity provided in the semiconductor laser structure is the M plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Herein, since the off-angle direction of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is also in the &lt;1-100&gt; direction, the surface morphology of the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> epitaxially grown on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the off-angle direction (&lt;1-100&gt; direction), as described above, whereby the longitudinal direction, so called &ldquo;stripe direction&rdquo;, of the cavity coincides with the direction in which the stripe pattern extends. Therefore, since the width of a portion between adjacent stripes (terrace portion) is 10 &mgr;m to 20 &mgr;m, and the cavity width is normally about 2 &mgr;m to 3 &mgr;m, it is possible to reliably form a cavity in the terrace portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Note that although the off-angle of the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set to be about 2&deg; in the second embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this as long as it is equal to or greater than 1&deg; and less than or equal to 10&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, each well layer is made of InGaN and each barrier layer is made of GaN. Alternatively, each well layer may be made of GaN, and each barrier layer may be made of AlGaN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Moreover, each of the n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may alternatively be a superlattice cladding layer including an AlGaN layer and a GaN layer that are layered together, instead of being an AlGaN single layer. Herein, in a case where a superlattice cladding layer is used, doping of an impurity such as silicon (Si), which is an n-type dopant, or magnesium (Mg), which is a p-type dopant, can be performed for at least one of the AlGaN layer and the GaN layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of a GaN-based compound semiconductor of the third embodiment is an epitaxial layer having a light emitting diode structure capable of emitting blue light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a structure in which an n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN, an n-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> including an n-type InGaN layer and an n-type GaN layer that are layered together, a multiple quantum well (MQW) active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> including well layers made of InGaN and barrier layers made of GaN that are layered together, a p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN, a p-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> including a p-type AlGaN layer and a p-type GaN layer that are layered together, and a p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> made of p-type GaN, are layered in this order, by epitaxial growth, on the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride (GaN) whose principal surface is inclined by an off-angle of about 2&deg; in the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction with respect to the (0001) plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Also in the third embodiment, the surface morphology of the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the off-angle direction (&lt;1-100&gt; direction), and the half-width of the X-ray rocking curve is reduced to about 80 seconds, thereby considerably improving the crystallinity as compared with that in the prior art. As a result, it has been confirmed that the light-emitting efficiency of a GaN-based blue light emitting diode element produced by using an epi-wafer of the third embodiment is significantly increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Note that although the off-angle in the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set to be about 2&deg; also in the third embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this as long as it is equal to or greater than 1&deg; and less than or equal to 10&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, each well layer is made of InGaN and each barrier layer is made of GaN. Alternatively, each well layer may be made of GaN, and each barrier layer may be made of AlGaN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a superlattice structure including an n-type InGaN layer and an n-type GaN layer that are layered together. Alternatively, it may have a superlattice structure including an n-type AlGaN layer and an n-type GaN layer, or a single-layer structure made of n-type GaN or n-type AlGaN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> has a superlattice structure including a p-type AlGaN layer and a p-type GaN layer that are layered together. Alternatively, it may have a single-layer structure made of p-type GaN or p-type AlGaN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Note that as in the second embodiment, impurity doping of an n-type dopant or a p-type dopant can be performed for at least one of the well layer or the barrier layer in the superlattice structure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The first example of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a perspective view illustrating the first example of the present invention, i.e., a violet semiconductor laser element produced by using a GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer according to the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The first example employs, as a crystal growth method for the element layer, an MOVPE method performed under a growth pressure of 300 Torr (1 Torr&equals;133.322 Pa), which is a depressurized condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A material gas made of trimethylaluminum (TMAl: (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Al), trimethylgallium (TMGa: (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Ga) or trimethylindium (TMIn: (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>In) is used as a group III source. Moreover, an ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) gas is used as a group V source. Monosilane (SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), for example, is used as an n-type impurity material, and cyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg: (C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg), for example, is used as a p-type impurity material. A hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) gas and a nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) gas are used as carrier gases for these material gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride (GaN) whose principal surface is inclined by an off-angle of about 2&deg; in the &lt;1-100&gt; direction with respect to the (0001) plane is used as a substrate for the element layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> First, an example of a growth process of the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed into a reaction chamber of an MOVPE apparatus, and then the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is heated to about 1050&deg; C., which is the growth temperature for the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Herein, when the substrate temperature reaches about 400&deg; C., the supply of an NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas is started so that the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will not be degenerated by heat. After passage of a few minutes since when the substrate temperature reaches about 1050&deg; C., the supply of TMGa and an SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas is started so as to grow the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN having a thickness of about 3 &mgr;m on the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the supply of TMAl is started so as to grow the n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of n-type AlGaN having a thickness of about 0.7 &mgr;m on the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Then, the supply of TMAl is stopped so as to grow the n-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN having a thickness of about 10 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Then, after the growth temperature is decreased to about 800&deg; C., the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is grown on the n-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Specifically, TMGa, TMIn and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a well layer made of InGaN having a thickness of about 3 nm, and TMGa and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a barrier layer made of GaN having a thickness of about 7.5 nm. These well layers and barrier layers are layered alternately on one another so as to obtain the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> including three pairs of these layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Then, after the growth temperature is increased to 1000&deg; C., TMAl, TMGa, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg are supplied so as to grow the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN having a thickness of about 2 nm on the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Then, the supply of TMAl is stopped, and the p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> made of p-type GaN having a thickness of about 10 nm is grown on the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Then, the supply of TMAl is resumed so as to grow the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN having a thickness of about 0.5 &mgr;m on the p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Then, the supply of TMAl is stopped so as to grow the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> made of p-type GaN having a thickness of about 0.2 &mgr;m on the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Then, after the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is grown, the supply of the material gas of TMGa, Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is stopped, and the intermediate product is cooled to room temperature while continuing to supply the carrier gas of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, after which the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is taken out of the reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The surface morphology of the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first example thus formed shows a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the off-angle direction of the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, i.e., the crystal zone axis &lt;1-100&gt; direction, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the half-width of the X-ray rocking curve obtained from the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is about 80 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Next, an example of a method for manufacturing the violet semiconductor laser element illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> First, a mask forming film (not shown) made of silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is deposited across the entire surface of the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by using a sputtering method or a CVD method, and then the mask forming film is patterned into a ridge stripe shape by using a photolithography method, thereby forming a mask film for a dry etching process from the mask forming film. Then, the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are etched by a reactive ion etching method using the formed mask film to a degree such that the p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is exposed, thereby transferring the ridge stripe shape of the mask film onto the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Then, after the mask film is removed, a protection insulative film <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> made of silicon oxide is deposited on the upper surface and the side surface of the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which have been etched, and on the exposed portion of the p-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, after which an opening through which the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is exposed is selectively formed in the protection insulative film <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> by using a photolithography method and a dry etching method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Then, a resist pattern having an opening in the region where the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is exposed is formed by using a photolithography method. Then, nickel (Ni) and gold (Au) are vapor-deposited in this order by using a vapor deposition method, or the like, after which a p-side electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> including Ni and Au layered together and being in an ohmic contact with the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed by using a lift-off method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Then, the surface (reverse surface) of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> opposite to the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is polished until the thickness thereof is about 100 &mgr;m. Then, titanium (Ti) and aluminum (Al) are vapor-deposited in this order on the reverse surface by using a vapor deposition method, or the like, thereby forming an n-side electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> including Ti and Al layered together and being in an ohmic contact with the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Then, the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is cleaved along the M plane so as to form a bar-shaped semiconductor layered structure that includes a plurality of cavities with the end surfaces of each cavity being exposed. Then, the reflection end surface (rear surface) of the cleavage surfaces is coated with a high reflection film made of a dielectric film whose reflectance is about 80%, and the emission end surface (front surface) opposing the reflection end surface is coated with a low reflection film made of a dielectric film whose reflectance is about 20%. Then, the bar-shaped semiconductor layered structure is divided into chips so that each chip includes at least one cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A GaN-based violet semiconductor laser element thus produced had an oscillation wavelength of 405 nm, and an evaluation on the laser light output characteristics and the current characteristics showed desirable characteristics, including a threshold current of about 45 mA and a threshold voltage of about 4.5 V. Thus, the operating current and the operating voltage when the optical output is 30 mW can be reduced, and thus the power to be input is reduced, thereby improving the reliability and realizing a prolongation of the operating lifetime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Note that while the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes well layers made of InGaN and barrier layers made of GaN, it may alternatively include well layers made of GaN or AlGaN and barrier layers made of n-type AlGaN, in which case it is possible to obtain laser light having an oscillation wavelength in the ultraviolet region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while an n-type impurity is not doped into either one of the well layer and the active layer of the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the first example, an n-type conductivity may be exhibited in some cases due to diffusion from the n-type light guide layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> during the growth process. Note however that an impurity may be actively doped into at least one of the well layers and the active layers during the growth of the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The second example of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The second example shows an example of a method for manufacturing a blue light emitting diode element produced by using a GaN-based compound semiconductor epi-wafer according to the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Again, an MOVPE method performed under a growth pressure of 300 Torr, which is a depressurized condition, is used as a crystal growth method for the element layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A material gas made of trimethylaluminum (TMAl), trimethylgallium (TMGa) or trimethylindium (TMIn) is used as a group III source, as in the first example. Moreover, an ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) gas is used as a group V source. Monosilane (SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), for example, is used as an n-type impurity material, and cyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg), for example, is used as a p-type impurity material. Moreover, a hydrogen gas and a nitrogen gas are used as carrier gases for these material gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of gallium nitride (GaN) whose principal surface is inclined by an off-angle of about 5&deg; in the &lt;1-100&gt; direction with respect to the (0001) plane is used as a substrate on which the element layer is grown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> First, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed into a reaction chamber of an MOVPE apparatus, and then the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is heated to about 1050&deg; C., which is the growth temperature for the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Herein, when the substrate temperature reaches about 400&deg; C., the supply of an NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas is started so that the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will not be degenerated by heat. After passage of a few minutes since when the substrate temperature reaches about 1050&deg; C., the supply of TMGa and an SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas is started so as to grow the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN having a thickness of about 3 &mgr;m on the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Then, the n-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> made of n-type GaN/undoped InGaN is grown on the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Specifically, TMGa, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a barrier layer made of n-type GaN having a thickness of about 2.5 nm, and TMGa, TMIn and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a well layer made of undoped InGaN having a thickness of about 2.5 nm. These barrier layers and well layers are further layered alternately on one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Then, the growth temperature is decreased to about 800&deg; C., and then the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is grown on the n-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Specifically, TMGa, TMIn and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a well layer made of InGaN having a thickness of about 3 nm, and TMGa, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a barrier layer made of n-type GaN having a thickness of about 7.5 nm. These well layers and barrier layers are layered alternately on one another so as to obtain the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> including five pairs of these layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Then, after the growth temperature is increased to 1000&deg; C., TMAl, TMGa, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg are supplied so as to grow the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN having a thickness of about 2 nm on the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, the p-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> made of p-type AlGaN/undoped GaN is grown on the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Specifically, TMGa, TMAl, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg are supplied so as to grow a barrier layer made of p-type AlGaN having a thickness of about 2.5 nm, and TMGa and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are supplied so as to grow a well layer made of GaN having a thickness of about 2.5 nm. These barrier layers and well layers are further layered alternately on one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Then, TMGa, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Cp<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Mg are supplied so as to grow the p-type contact layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> made of p-type GaN having a thickness of about 0.2 &mgr;m on the p-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Then, although not shown, a p-side electrode is formed on the p-type contact layer, and an n-side electrode is formed on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> opposite to the element layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, after which the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is divided into chips of an intended size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The surface morphology of the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the second example thus formed shows a stripe pattern extending substantially in parallel to the off-angle direction of the principal surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, i.e., the &lt;1-100&gt; direction, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the half-width of the X-ray rocking curve obtained from the epi-wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is about 80 seconds, indicating a good crystallinity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Note that in the n-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, only the GaN layer, which is a barrier layer, is doped with an impurity, and also in the p-type superlattice cladding layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, only the AlGaN layer, which is a barrier layer, is doped with an impurity. However, the present invention is not limited to this, as long as at least one of the barrier layer and the well layer is doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, only the GaN layer, which is a barrier layer, is doped with an impurity. However, the present invention is not limited to this, as long as at least one of the barrier layer and the well layer is doped, or the barrier layer and the well layer may be both undoped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Note that the superlattice layers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the MQW active layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are not substantially doped with an impurity during the crystal growth process, as described above. However, due to diffusion of an impurity during or after the crystal growth process from a semiconductor layer that is adjacent to these undoped layers and that is doped with an impurity, the impurity may be contained in the undoped layers. Therefore, in the present specification, an undoped layer is not limited to a semiconductor layer that is not substantially doped with an impurity during the crystal growth process, but may include a semiconductor layer that contains an impurity from an adjacent semiconductor layer as a result of diffusion. </paragraph>
