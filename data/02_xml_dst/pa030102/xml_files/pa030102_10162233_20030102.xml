<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally directed to liquid propane powered forklift trucks and, more specifically, to a fuel tank cradle device for forklift trucks, which enables a fuel tank to be lowered to as near the ground as possible, thereby assuring easy and safe change of the fuel tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is generally known in the art, conventional forklift trucks include a vehicle frame, a mast attached to the front end of the vehicle frame, a fork carriage adapted for elevational movement along the mast to raise and lower loads and a counterweight located at the rear end of the vehicle frame for retaining balance of the forklift truck as heavyweight loads are lifted up and lowered down. Mounted substantially at the center of the vehicle frame is an engine which will be kept covered with a hood or bonnet. A driver&apos;s seat is fixedly secured to the hood and surrounded by an overhead guard which defines a cabin of the trucks. In case of a liquid propane powered forklift truck, it would be necessary to replaceably mount a fuel tank, e.g., liquid propane tank, over the counterweight in a manner that the fuel tank lies on its side and is tied up with a bander or clamp. At the time when the fuel tank runs dry, the bander is untied to permit replacement of the fuel tank with a full one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There occur frequently such instances where the hood is opened for the operator to gain access to an engine room provided under the hood. The fuel tank held above the counterweight will at this time hinder the backward swing of the seat and thus heavily restrict the opening angle of the hood. In other words, the hood cannot be fully opened without removing the fuel tank prior to the backward opening of the hood. To assure that the hood be opened to its full opening angle, therefore, it is required to remove the fuel tank beforehand into a position wherein no physical interference may take place between the seat and the fuel tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As a solution to this problem, use has been made of a fold-back type fuel tank mount that enables a fuel tank to be moved rearwardly from its home position in advance of a hood being opened. The fold-back type fuel tank mount includes a base plate attached to a counterweight of the forklift truck, a swingable cradle lying above the base plate and having a bander with which the fuel tank may be tied up, a hinge for coupling the swingable cradle to the base plate and a latch adapted to retain the swingable cradle against any unwanted swinging movement with respect to the base plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In operation, pulling backward the fuel tank with the latch released will cause the swingable cradle to turn rearwardly about a horizontal hinge axis so that the fuel tank is removed out of the home position to permit full opening of the hood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Due mainly to the heavyweight nature of the fuel tank, the fold-back type fuel tank mount stated above tends to pose a drawback in that, in the process of swinging the cradle together with the fuel tank, a significant magnitude of mechanical shock may occur with the result that parts or components are subjected to deformation and even breakage. An attempt has been made to avoid such drawback in U.S. Pat. No. 5,634,665, which discloses a sliding type fuel tank mount including a fixed plate attached to the counterweight of a forklift truck and a movable plate supporting the fuel tank thereon and adapted for backward sliding movement with respect to the fixed plate to leave a room for accommodation of a seat-carrying hood when the latter is to be opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With the prior art fuel tank mounts as referred to hereinabove, as the fuel tank runs dry, it is usually the responsibility of the operator to replace the empty tank with a full one. This requires six steps: (i) Disconnect a feed hose leading from the tank to an engine; (ii) Unclamp the empty tank from its cradle; (iii) Lift and remove the empty tank; (iv) Lift a new tank and place it is the cradle; (v) Clamp the new tank in place; and (vi) Connect the feed hose to the new tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The tank replacing procedure entails a difficult and potentially dangerous task. The main difficulty with this procedure lies in steps (iii) and (iv) wherein the operator must lift the fuel tank from the ground to a height of 120 cm or more. Empty liquid propane tanks normally weight between 8.5 and 22 kg, full tanks weighing about 17.5 to 41 kg. With the fuel tank held at chest level or higher, the operator has to extend the tank over the counterweight to drop it into the cradle, in which process the risk of injury to the operator is significant. Some operators consider heaving the tank onto the truck to be a &ldquo;macho&rdquo; part of the job. But with more women drivers being hired and the tightening of union rules and government safety regulations, there is a need for an improved fuel tank mount that eases the task of loading and unloading fuel tanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In consideration of such a problem, U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,892 discloses a fuel tank mount for forklift trucks with a swing arm swingable about a tilted pivot axis, which enables a fuel tank to be replaced with ease. The fuel tank mount includes a swing arm replaceable carrying the fuel tank, which is pivotally mounted to a tilted pivot pin for rotation between a home position wherein the tank is held above and laterally across the counterweight and a tank changing position wherein the tank lies alongside the counterweight. In the fuel tank mount of the construction referred to just above, the fuel tank is replaced with a new one in a state where the swing arm is located at the tank changing position, and the swing arm is rotated to its original position, the home position, so that the new fuel tank can be held above the counterweight. In this way, the fuel tank mount enables a fuel tank to be more easily replaced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Fuel tank cradle devices for forklift trucks according to preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a fuel tank cradle device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, disposed behind a vehicle frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fixed to the top surface of the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> swingably assembled with the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a plurality of assembling slots <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in which assembling bolts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are fitted. The assembling bolts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are driven through the assembling slots <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fixedly assembled with the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the forklift truck. Further, the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a bearing tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> protruding upwards from one lateral portion of the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which has a hinge hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed through the bearing tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adapted to support a fuel tank T while the fuel tank is laid on its side on the cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> pivotally assembled with the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A hinge bolt <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> assembled with the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotatably fitted in the hinge hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bearing tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this way, the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> assembled with the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the hinge bolt <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is swingable about the hinge bolt <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As a result, the cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is freely swingable with respect to the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that is to say, the cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may swing between a home position. A above the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a rotated position B outside of the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serves to support the fuel tank T through direct contact with the fuel tank T, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is assembled with the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a hinge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, so that the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be pivotally moved about the hinge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> between an unfolded position C where the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in line with the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a downwardly folded position D where the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> makes a right angle with respect to the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. When the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> hingedly assembled with the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is swung to the outside of the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then pivotally moved about the hinge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the downwardly folded position D, the fuel tank T can be vertically loaded on the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a supporting portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> bent and extending at an angle from an end of the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to support the bottom of the vertically standing fuel tank T in the state where the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located at the downwardly folded position D. Further, the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a pair of clamp assemblies <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> replaceably fastening the fuel tank T. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each clamp assembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes an upper clamp <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a semicircular shape, a lower clamp <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also having a semicircular configuration and hingedly assembled with the upper clamp <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and a clamp latch <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>fixing the free ends of the upper clamp <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lower clamp <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the fuel tank cradle device includes a damping means for controlling the folding speed of the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with respect to the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A gas-filled damper <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided which has one end rotatably fixed to the lower surface of the first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the other end rotatably fixed to the lower surface of the second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>.

Since the construction of the fuel tank cradle device according to the present embodiment is similar to that according to the previous embodiment, only the different elements will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the fuel tank cradle device according to the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the cradle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a first body <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> foldably connected to the first body <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and a third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extendably assembled with the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be extended out from the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As stated, earlier, the first body <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is swingably assemble with the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of a hinge bolt <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be pivoted about a hinge <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> between the unfolded position C and the downwardly folded position D. In this case, the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes two tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> extending parallel to each other, and brackets <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for connecting the tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is adapted to support the fuel tank T while making direct contact with the fuel tank T. The third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has a supporting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that can support the lower surface of the fuel tank T and is assembled with the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can linearly move in the longitudinal direction of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes two rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> fitted in the tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can linearly move inwards or outwards of the tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, so that the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be extended out from or inserted into the ends of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction. Since the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are fitted in the tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can linearly move inwards or outwards of the tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be extended out from or telescopically inserted into the ends of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the fuel tank T standing upright can be lowered to a location adjacent to the ground, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. For this reason, the rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> must have a sufficient length to allow the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to be lowered from the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to a location adjacent to the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the fuel tank cradle device according to the present embodiment, unlike the previous embodiment, the cradle latch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the locking means for locking the cradle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided at the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and the locking pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is so arranged as to be aligned with the cradle latch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Further, the pair of clamp assemblies <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> replaceably fastening the fuel tank T are provided at the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, one for each body. This construction ensures that one clamp assembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can fasten the fuel tank T to the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> even when the fuel tank T is lowered adjacent to the ground through the extension of the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> from the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the fuel tank cradle device according to the present embodiment includes a damping means for controlling the speed of the linear movement of the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with respect to the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The damping means includes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> respectively formed at the tubular members <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which are movably disposed in the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, pistons <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> formed at ends of the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and dividing an interior of each of the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to first and second chambers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, connector tubes <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> connecting the first and the second chambers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> of each of the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> with each other, and oil <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> filled in the first and the second chambers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, when the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> linearly moves with respect to the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also perform linear movement along the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. At this time, the oil <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> filled in the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> prevents the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> having the pistons <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> from moving rapidly, but allows the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to slowly move along the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, as the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> move along the cylinders <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, the volume of the second chamber <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> located in front of the movement is gradually reduced while the volume of the first chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> located behind the movement gradually increases, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. In this case, the oil <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> in the second chamber <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is fed through the connector tube <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to the first chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of increasing capacity, so that the rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can go on moving in its proceeding direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In other words, the moving speed of the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with respect to the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is controlled by the damping means having the construction described above. Therefore, the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which supports the heavy fuel tank T standing upright as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, is prevented from rapidly extending out from the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Further, in the fuel tank cradle device according to the present invention, two pistons <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are formed at each of the rods <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in a spaced-apart relationship with each other so as to form as many overlapping sections between the cylinder <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> as possible, thereby improving the structural integrity between the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> when the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is extended from the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the fuel tank cradle device of the construction described above, the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> capable of being extended away from the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is further provided, so that the loaded fuel tank T can be lowered to as near the ground as possible as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. Therefore, the fuel tank cradle device according to the present embodiment remarkably reduces the difficulty and danger in loading or unloading the heavyweight fuel tank T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> show a dual-type fuel tank cradle device according to a further embodiment of the present invention. The dual-type fuel tank cradle device includes two fuel tank cradle devices (hereinafter, referred to a first and second fuel tank cradle devices), which have the same construction and are disposed on opposite lateral side portions of the upper surface of the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the dual-type fuel tank cradle device, the first and second fuel tank cradle devices enable a spare fuel tank T to be additionally loaded on a forklift truck, thereby assuring continuous fuel supply even when the fuel in one fuel tank is exhausted. It is preferred that the cradles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the first and second fuel tank cradle devices can be rotated backward of the counterweight <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the fuel tanks T can be easily replaced even in a narrow road or space. Instead of the first and second fuel tank cradle devices shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, each of which has the cradle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> including the first body <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the second body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the third body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it may be possible to sue first and second fuel tank cradle devices, each of which has a cradle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> including a first body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a second body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, similarly to the fuel tank cradle device according to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the fuel tank cradle device according to the present invention as described above, a fuel tank can be replaced with minimal force in an easy and convenient manner, since the fuel tank can be located at an optimal position for the replacement of the fuel tank by way of rotating a cradle outward of the counterweight and then folding the cradle downwardly. The cradle capable of being extended further in the longitudinal direction enables the fuel tank to be lowered to as near the ground as possible, thereby largely reducing the danger which would otherwise be encountered in lifting the heavy fuel tank. Further, in the case of the dual-type fuel tank cradle device including two fuel tank, cradle devices, a spare fuel tank, which can be additionally loaded on a forklift truck, enables continuous fuel supply to the forklift truck even when the fuel in one fuel tank is exhausted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
