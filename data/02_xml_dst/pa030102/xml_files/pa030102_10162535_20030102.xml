<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a low-water flush toilet and in particular to a toilet providing multiple pulse jets of flush water moving in opposite directions on ledges provided on the toilet bowl near its upper end. The flush water applied to the inner surface of the bowl is carefully controlled to produce consistent and repeatable flushing operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Water shortages on RV&apos;s and boats lead to the use of low-water flush toilets. In some situations, in boats and RV&apos;s, conservation of water is essential. The new flush system of this invention is created by providing dual nozzles at the back of the toilet bowl for providing alternating pulses of water from each nozzle, directed so that the water will move along ledges which extends on the sides of the bowl to the front of the bowl, the movement of each pulse of flush water providing for uniformed wetting of one half of the bowl surface below the ledge. The nozzle are directed in opposite directions so that when viewed from above, one jet of flush water will be moving counter-clockwise (from the back of the bowl to the front of the bowl) and the other jet of flush water will be moving in a clockwise direction (from the back of the bowl to the front of the bowl). As a result, total wetting of the bowl will be achieved because each volume of pulsed water can be controlled so as to totally wet half of the bowl, in contrast to previous pulsed flush toilets in which the pulsed water must wet the entire bowl in one pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> During flushing, a slide valve at the bottom of the bowl will be opened to allow the pulsed water in the bowl to move the entire content of the bowl into a holding tank below the outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The slide valve is connected through a clutch to an actuator and this prevents damage to the slide valve in the event of a blockage at the outlet. In such case, the actuator would simply &ldquo;free wheel&rdquo; without moving the slide valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a slip tube or spacer allows variable height positioning of the bowl to meet the demands of the RV and boat industry. The slip tube provided in this toilet to allow the same toilet to be offered to customers in variable heights without adding unnecessary costs because the remaining mechanics of the toilet remain the same. A slip tube spacer is provided to allow the slide valve to be positioned a further distance from the holding tank in a higher (taller) version of the toilet. The slip tube or spacer also ensures a &ldquo;no leak&rdquo; path for water from the bowl to the floor to accommodate small variances in dimensions in bowls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a toilet that consistently cleans the bowl&apos;s surface using a minimum quantity of water. Further, the electronic controls enable easy flushing of the toilet by the user, having only to depress a control button. A second button when depressed adds water to the bowl to enable the user to leave the toilet with the desired amount of water in the bowl. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The flush toilet of this invention is shown at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> and designated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of china to provide a feeling of being home when using the toilet. The usual cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and seat <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> rest on the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when not in use. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has an upper end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a lower discharge outlet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The inner surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed with left and right hand ledges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> each of which extends from the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the front <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As used throughout the specification and claims the term &ldquo;ledge&rdquo; is used to refer to a portion of the bowl surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having a slope or an incline that is closer to horizontal than the slope of the surrounding bowl surface both below and above the ledge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted on the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a position adjacent the end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of ledge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A second nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is similarly mounted on the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a position adjacent the end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of ledge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjacent the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Water comes out of each of the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as primarily horizontally directed jets. In a preferred embodiment, the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> each include orifices, an inboard orifice and an outboard orifice, connected by a slot. The outboard orifices are larger in diameter than the inboard orifices such that water is primarily ducted along the ledges toward the front of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the ledges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are contoured so that they are wide at their ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> where the pulsed jet of flush water first hits the ledge and are slimmer at the ends <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This contour ensures that all of the bowl surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is uniformly wetted to achieve continuous cleaning of the surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when the toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is flushed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A drain pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is mounted on the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to avoid water in the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> overflowing out of the toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An arcuate cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted in the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the rear <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to cover the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the drain <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is spaced ahead of the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to avoid flush water splashing on a user of the toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Flush water from the nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) will follow a path which is counter-clockwise and the flush water from nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will follow a clockwise path as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It is to be noted that the flush water will fall onto the bowl surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> below the ledges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> but neither ledge will have water flowing very far from the end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the ledge. The electronic controls, not yet explained, and the water system limit the pressure of the pulses so that they lose their momentum without proceeding much beyond the ends of the ledges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A rearward extension <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> supports the water systems and the controls that provide the necessary amenities for the toilet. A pad <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the extension <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in a location where it can be readily reached by a user sitting on the toilet. Push buttons <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to a circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which controls a dual solenoid water valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that when the flush button <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is depressed the dual solenoid water valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides water alternatively to the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this manner water from each nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is under enough pressure that it will travel on the ledge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the rear end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the front end of the ledge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with water running off the ledge and down the bowl surface toward the outlet at all times as the water travels lengthwise along the ledge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Under the control of the circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, water through the nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is then discontinued when it is timed out. Just before nozzle 30 times out, the circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> causes water to be supplied through the nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which provides the same performance on the ledge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The controller is programmed to stop alternating the supply of water to the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> after a certain time. When the nozzles are &ldquo;on&rdquo;, the jets are at desired pressure capable of wetting the bowl uniformly with water without danger of having water run up and out of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The appropriate design and construction of the circuit board will be apparent to one skilled in the art depending on the specific design criteria of the toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with which it is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A motor driven slide blade <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 9</cross-reference>) is movable between a closed position and an open position in which the contents of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can drop through the outlet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and into a suitable holding tank (not shown). A motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> drives a plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which meshes with a driven plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which in turn drives a screw <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that is engaged and operable to move the slide gate valve <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> between open and closed positions. In the event of a blockage at the outlet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is engaged by the slide valve <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the clutch formed by plates <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will begin to slip relative to one another causing plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to move axially away from and out of meshed engagement with plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, against the biasing the spring <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, stopping rotation of the screw <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the mechanical clutch system described above, the invention could alternately employ an electric clutch. Such a clutch, in one embodiment, current being drawn by the motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is monitored. Upon sensing an increase or spike in drawn current, indicating blocked movement by the blade <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> would be shut down or reversed. The system would then periodically operate the motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to determine if the blockage has be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, it will be seen that one of the advantages of this invention is the adaptability of the invention to china toilets which are difficult to maintain tolerances. The china bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a fired clay body having low porosity that resembles glass. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the toilet bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a base <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a cavity <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> which extends upwardly in the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is adapted to be mounted on the floor and is retained on the floor by mounting bolts <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> carries a fixture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which includes a tubular section <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which is aligned with the bowl opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an upwardly extending annular rim <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. A seal member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> made of rubber or the like is mounted on the rim <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and sealingly abuts a tubular member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> mounted to the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> below the side blade <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and through which the water from the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is directed downwardly into a floor mounted pipe <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that extends into the holding tank (not shown). In the toilet shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the distance between the bowl opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the fixture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is minimal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> toilet is shown in which the distance between the slide blade <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is at a maximum. This maximum distance is achieved by a cavity <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, which is much longer than the cavity <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is of a maximum height. In this cavity <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, a slip tube <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is provided to accommodate the increased height of the cavity <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The upper end of the slip tube <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is provided with a seal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is identical to the seal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and which telescopingly receives tubular section <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The lower end of slip tube <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to be the same as tubular section <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and is telescopingly received in tubular section <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, sealingly engaged by seal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As such, the slip tube <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> allows the exact same parts to be used with a low height toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as with a &ldquo;taller&rdquo; height toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while providing a leak proof path for water from the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the floor mounted pipe <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Like parts in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> are identified by similar numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The use of the seals <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the toilets shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> enable the manufacture of leak proof passages in the bowls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> even though the bowls are not of a consistent size because of the inherent characteristics of china clay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the use of the toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to institute full flush activation, the user depresses the button <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the pad <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is connected by wiring <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the circuit board assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which includes a microprocessor which signals to the dual solenoid water valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which operates to alternately open and close the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and that sequence continues until the control board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> times out. During the providing of water from the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the circuit board assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> also activates the motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to cause the slide blade <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to open, removing all contents from the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After a set amount of time, the circuit board assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> also causes the motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to close the slide blade <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In case it is desired to clean the flush system, the button <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be repeatedly depressed to flush the system to the satisfaction of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To add water to the bowl either before or following the full flushing of the toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a second button <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be depressed thereby signaling the circuit board assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to open both of the nozzles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the same time so as to add more flush water to the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a very short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In light of the above, it is seen that this toilet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a china bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that can operate to uniformly wet the inside of the bowl <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during a flushing operation. A modern electronically controlled flush water system provides for alternate flushing water on the contoured ledges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the inside of the bowl. Similarly, the clutch drive for the slide valve <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> ensures a long life for the valve <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
