<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an absorbent product, such as a diaper, an incontinence pad or the like, comprising a liquid-permeable surface material, a liquid-impermeable backing material and an absorption body enclosed therebetween. The product also has a front portion, a rear portion and a crotch portion located between the front and rear portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional absorbent products of this type usually have an attachment system for securing the absorbent product around a wearer. The attachment system may consist of, for example, a first and a second part which interact, for example an attachment flap (tab), and a receiving part (landing zone) for the tab. The tab can be provided with glue or a similar adhesive which is attached to the landing zone which then often consists of a strip of plastic material, for example polypropylene. Alternatively, the tab is designed with a first part and the landing zone with a second part of a touch and close (hook and loop) attachment system. Usually, the tab is provided with the male part or hook part of such a system, and the landing zone with the female part or loop part of the system. The landing zone is normally attached to the front portion of the absorbent product in an area along the front end edge of the product so that it extends in the transverse direction of the product along a considerable part of the width of the product in the waist area. In this way, the tab can interact with the landing zone along the entire length of the landing zone in order that as good an adjustment as possible of the product to the wearer is obtained. Examples of this type of conventional hook and loop attachment system are found in EP 0 276 970 B1, EP 0 324 578 B1 and EP 0 491 347. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One problem with this type of receiving strip of the touch and close type is that they are expensive to manufacture. It is not unusual for the cost of the receiving strip to account for up to 10% of the total material cost of the product. Furthermore, as it is attached to the product, the landing zone causes the area where the strip is connected to the product to be stiffer in relation to surrounding areas, which can lead to the product chafing against the body of the wearer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to remedy the above-mentioned problems and to construct an absorbent product with a receiving strip which has a relatively low cost as far as material and manufacture are concerned and which at the same time makes the product fit stably on the wearer and also feels soft and pleasant against the body of the wearer of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that it consists of a diaper, an incontinence pad or the like, which comprises a liquid-permeable surface layer, a liquid-impermeable backing material and an absorption body enclosed between the surface layer and the backing material. The product has a front portion, a rear portion and a crotch portion located between the front and rear portions, and also an attachment system for securing the absorbent product on a wearer, the attachment system comprising at least one tab for detachable interaction with a landing zone arranged on the front or rear portion of the product. The landing zone is designed as a strip with two long sides and two short sides which join the two long sides together, and also comprises a central inactive area arranged centrally in the transverse direction on the landing zone, and two active areas arranged one on each side of the central inactive area so that the active areas extend in the transverse direction from the central inactive area to the short sides of the landing zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> By means of the present invention, an absorbent product of the type referred to in the introduction has been produced, which product essentially eliminates the problems mentioned previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention comprises a diaper or an incontinence pad comprising a liquid-permeable surface layer, a liquid-impermeable backing material and an absorption body enclosed therebetween. The diaper is intended to surround the lower part of the trunk of the wearer like a pair of absorbent pants. It has a front portion intended to face forwards on the wearer during use, a rear portion intended to face backwards on the wearer during use, and a narrower crotch portion located between the front and rear portions, which is intended to be arranged in the crotch of the wearer between the legs of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The front or rear portion of the absorbent product is provided with at least one attachment flap or tab for securing the absorbent product around the wearer. The tab is intended to interconnect the rear and front portions of the absorbent product by virtue of an attachment element arranged on the tab being attached to a receiving part or landing zone for the attachment element arranged on the front or rear portion of the product. The product is preferably provided with two tabs arranged on the rear side panels of the product, one tab on each rear side panel, and a landing zone on the front portion of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The landing zone is suitably designed as a strip with two short sides and two long sides. The long sides extend parallel or essentially parallel to the front end edge of the diaper along a relatively large part of the front end edge, and the short sides join the two long sides together. The landing zone consists of a material which is adapted to interact with the attachment element. The landing zone preferably consists of the female part (loop part) of a touch and close tape, and the attachment element of the male part (hook part) of the touch and close tape. The female and male parts of the touch and close tape are usually in the form of a support means and, arranged on the support means, a material which constitutes either eyes or loops or, respectively, hooks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When an absorbent product is correctly adapted to the wearer, that is to say, when the wearer is wearing a product of the correct size, it should be designed in such a manner that it fits stably around the body of the wearer. In order that the product is secured stably, the attachment elements of the tabs should attach to the landing zone so that the attachment system interacts in the most suitable manner with the other parts of the product, which means that the attachment elements are to attach to those parts of the landing zone lying out towards the short sides of the landing zone. Use is therefore not made of the central part of the landing zone for attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The landing zone according to an embodiment of the invention therefore comprises a support means which is designed as a strip which corresponds to the extent of the landing zone. On the support means, attachment means, preferably in the form of loop elements, are arranged on those parts of the support means which are located in the areas around the short sides, so that an inactive area of only support material is formed between two active areas which are provided with attachment means. In this way, the landing zone can be divided into two active areas and an intermediate central inactive area. As the attachment means are not arranged on the whole landing zone, it is cheaper and simpler to manufacture, at the same time as the central inactive part is flexible and relatively soft. Another advantage of a landing zone of this type is that any patterns, colours or printing on the support means are more clearly visible if it is free of attachment means.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The absorbent product shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a diaper or an incontinence pad <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprising a liquid-permeable surface layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a liquid-impermeable backing material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an absorption body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> enclosed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The liquid-permeable surface layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably consists of a material which has properties such as dryness and softness during use of the absorbent product, as this layer makes contact with the body of the wearer. It is desirable that the layer has a soft and textile-like surface which remains dry even if wetted repeatedly. The surface layer can consist of, for example, a non-woven material with a soft and smooth surface such as, for example, a spunbond made of polypropylene fibers, a meltblown material or a bonded carded fibre material. In order to keep the surface next to the skin of the wearer dry, a hydrophobic nonwoven material can be used, which is perforated so that openings are formed in the material which are larger than the cavities between the fibers in the material. In this way, liquid can be conducted through the openings made in the surface layer down to the underlying absorption body. Other examples of material for the surface layer are, for example, perforated plastic films such as, for example, perforated polyethylene film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The liquid-impermeable backing material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can consist of a thin film of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) or another suitable material, a hydrophobed non-woven layer or a laminate of a thin film and a non-woven material. This type of laminate is often used to obtain a soft, textile-like exterior on the backing layer. In order to achieve a more airy and pleasant product, it is also possible to make use of breathable backing layers which prevent liquid escaping from the absorbent product but allow moisture to be ventilated out. These breathable backing layers can consist of single material layers or of laminates of, for example, blown or moulded polyethylene films which are laminated with, for example, a non-woven layer made of spunbond or spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (SMS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The surface layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the backing material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have a slightly greater extent in the plane than the absorption body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and extend outside the edges of the latter. The layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are interconnected in the projecting portions, for example by gluing or welding using heat or ultrasound. They can also be connected to the absorption body by, for example, glue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The absorption body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be of any conventional type. The absorption body is usually made up of one or more layers of cellulose fibers, for example cellulose fluff pulp. Other materials which can be used are, for example, absorbent non-woven materials, foamed materials, synthetic fibre materials or peat. In addition to cellulose fibers or other absorbent materials, the absorption body can also contain superabsorbent material, what are known as SAPs (superabsorbent polymers), that is to say material in the form of fibers, particles, granules, film or the like, which has the capacity to absorb liquid corresponding to several times the weight of the superabsorbent material itself. The superabsorbent material binds the liquid and forms a liquid-containing gel. The absorption body can also comprise binders and shape-stabilizing components or the like. Additional absorption layers which improve the absorption properties can also be used, such as various types of liquid-spreading material layers or inserts, what are known as wadding. The absorption body can be treated chemically or physically in order to modify the absorption properties. It is possible, for example, to provide an absorption layer with compressions in order to control the liquid flow in the absorption body. It is also possible to enclose the absorbent layer or the absorbent layers in a covering made of, for example, tissue material. The absorption body usually has an elongate shape in the longitudinal direction and can be, for example, essentially rectangular, T-shaped or hourglass-shaped. In a T-shaped absorption body, the transverse part is intended to face the front portion of the absorbent product during use so that it lies in the area around the abdomen of the wearer during use. An hourglass-shaped absorption body is wider in the front and rear portions than in the crotch portion in order to afford effective liquid take-up at the same time as the design makes it easier for the product to shape itself and close tightly around the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The diaper is intended to surround the lower part of the trunk of the wearer like a pair of absorbent pants. It has a front portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> intended to face forwards on the wearer during use, a rear portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> intended to face backwards on the wearer during use, and a narrower crotch portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> located between the front and rear portions, which is intended to be arranged in the crotch of the wearer between the legs of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The diaper is suitably symmetrical with regard to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> running in the longitudinal direction of the diaper. The transverse direction of the diaper is the direction which extends across the product and is parallel or on the whole parallel to a transverse axis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which forms a right angle to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Those parts on both sides of the crotch portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the transverse direction which extend outside the absorption body are preferably provided with one or more elastic means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which run essentially in the longitudinal direction of the diaper. The elastic means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> function as leg elastic and serve the purpose of preventing liquid and motions leaking out through the longitudinal side edges of the diaper and in this way form outer liquid barriers. The elastic means can consist of one or more elastic threads or strips which are applied in the stretched state between the backing layer and the surface layer. Alternatively, the elastic can be arranged between the layers in the unstretched state and the two layers instead are then stretched during application. It is also possible to arrange the elastic on the outside of the backing layer or on the inside of the surface layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To provide further protection against liquid or motions leaking out, the absorbent product can also be provided, on the side facing the wearer, with inner liquid barriers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which are attached close to the longitudinal edges inside the outer liquid barriers. The inner liquid barriers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are preferably made from an essentially liquid-impermeable material such as, for example, a hydrophobic nonwoven or a plastic film and are designed as a longitudinal web with a first edge <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is connected to the absorbent product and a second, free edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is intended to make contact with the wearer during use of the absorbent product. The second edge is provided with one or more elastic elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, preferably an elastic thread, which, in the contracted state, gathers the free edge so that an upright barrier is formed. The inner barrier can be designed as a strip made of a single layer where the free edge is folded down in order to enclose the elastic element so as to prevent direct contact of the elastic thread with the wearer. Alternatively, the barrier can be made from two layers joined together with the elastic thread attached at the edge of the free end between the two layers. In this case, the inner layer of the barrier can consist of an extension of the surface layer, and the outer layer of an essentially liquid-impermeable material, or the inner and outer layers of the barrier can consist of one and the same material strip which is folded around the elastic thread. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The rear and/or front portions of the product can also be provided with waist elastic <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which consists of elastic means arranged along the front and/or rear end edges in order to enable the product to enclose the waist of the wearer in a soft and flexible manner. The elastic means are suitably attached between the backing material and the surface layer by glue or by welding, for example ultrasonic welding. The elastic means can consist of one or more elastic threads which are applied in the stretched state between the layers and in this way form the waist elastic. Alternatively, the elastic can be arranged between the layers in the unstretched state and the two layers instead are then stretched during application. Another common variant of elastic which is suitable is elastic foamed material consisting of a thin strip of, for example, polyurethane foam which can be arranged between the two layers in the same way as the elastic threads. It is of course also possible to position the elastic means for the waist elastic on the outside of the backing layer or on the inside of the surface layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Those parts of the rear portion of the diaper which, in the transverse direction on both sides of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, extend outside the absorption body constitute the rear side panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the diaper. In the same way, the absorbent product can be provided with front side panels <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The front or rear side panels of the absorbent product are provided with an attachment system for securing the absorbent product around a wearer. The attachment system consists of at least one attachment flap or tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a receiving part or landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is intended to interconnect the rear and front portions of the absorbent product by virtue of an attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> arranged on the tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being attached to the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is arranged on the front or rear portion of the product. The product is preferably provided with two tabs arranged on the rear side panels, one tab on each rear side panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the front portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the product on the side facing away from the wearer during use of the diaper, that is to say on the outside of the backing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The tabs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are connected to the rear side panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the areas which lie at the side edge of the side panels, which runs in the longitudinal direction. The connection can be brought about by, for example, glue, tape, heat-sealing or welding at separate points, along lines or over continuous surface areas. The tabs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be attached to the backing material or surface layer of the absorbent product, between the backing material and the surface layer, or be designed so that the tabs are attached so that one part of the tab lies on the outside of the backing material and another part of the tab lies on the inside of the product, that is to say on that side of the surface layer which faces the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> preferably consists of a male part of a touch and close (hook and loop) tape. The attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is attached to the tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by, for example, glue, tape, by thermal connection or by another suitable attachment means, on that part of the tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which faces away from the rear side panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the product and on that side of the tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which faces the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during use of the diaper. That part of the tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is arranged outside the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the lateral direction constitutes a gripping tab <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which serves the purpose of making it easier to apply and remove the attachment element to and from the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is suitably designed as an oblong strip which extends essentially parallel to the front end edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the diaper, that is to say in the transverse direction of the diaper, and consists of a material which is adapted to interact with the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The extent of the landing zone in the transverse direction of the diaper can vary depending on style and size and can therefore extend along the entire front end edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the diaper or along a part thereof. The landing zone suitably extends along a relatively large part of the front end edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that it runs out over the front side panels in order that as good an adjustment as possible of the diaper to the wearer can be obtained. The extent of the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the diaper can also vary depending on how it is to be adapted to the diaper, but is suitably adapted to the extent of the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the same direction. The landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably consists of the female part (loop part) of a touch and close tape, and the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the male part (hook part) of the touch and close tape. It would also be possible to use the hook and loop parts the other way round, but the loop part is more suitable as the landing zone because it does not have the same problem as a hook part which easily catches on clothing and other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The female and male parts of the touch and close tape are usually in the form of a support means and, arranged on the support means, a material which constitutes either loops or eyes or, respectively, hooks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention will be described in greater detail below. The landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> consists of a continuous support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is designed as a strip, which corresponds to the extent of the landing zone, with two long sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and two short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which join the two long sides together. The long sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are parallel or essentially parallel to the front end edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the diaper and therefore extend in the transverse direction of the diaper, and the short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are suitably straight and arranged at right angles to the long sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. It is also possible for the short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to be rounded or to have another shape which is suitable for the diaper to which the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached. On the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, attachment means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, preferably in the form of loop elements, are arranged on only those parts of the support means which, in the transverse direction, are located in the areas around the short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so that a central inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> consisting of only the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed between active areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which extend in the transverse direction from the central inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the landing zone and consist of the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the attachment means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>). In the longitudinal direction of the diaper, both the central inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the two active areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> extend along the entire extent of the landing zone. The active areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can therefore interact with the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the attachment means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has such an extent that it completely covers the active areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order that the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is secured as well as possible along the entire extent of the active areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The manufacture itself of the landing zone is not described in greater detail in the application because any suitable method of manufacturing touch and close parts with support means and attachment means can be used for the present invention. Suitable materials for the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the attachment means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, polyamide or another thermoplastic, as well as even biodegradable materials such as, for example, polylactide, polycaprolactone or other polyhydroxyalkanoates and materials, for example polymer materials, manufactured from renewable raw materials such as, for example, maize starch or cellulose. Examples of methods of manufacturing male parts or female parts for attachment elements are described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,298 A, US 5,611,791 A, US 5,032,122 and US 5,318,741 A, and biodegradable materials in US 5,939,467 A and WO 00/01339 A1. It is a common feature of the attachment elements described and the methods of manufacturing them that the touch and close strip itself is made up of a substrate or support part and that material in the form of hooks or loops is arranged on the substrate. By not arranging hooks or loops on parts of the support means in the manufacturing process, it is possible to manufacture a landing zone according to an embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment, the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is, as described previously, designed with a centrally positioned inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and two active areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are arranged one on each side of the central inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this case, the active areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are in turn divided into active part areas <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and the landing zone is inactive between the active areas owing to either one or a number of inactive part areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). According to this embodiment, the central inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the inactive part areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> consist of the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the same way as described previously, and the active part areas of support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and attachment means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. By virtue of the fact that a smaller part of the surface of the landing zone is provided with attachment means, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing cost further. As the active part areas <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extend from the short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in towards the central inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, good attachment of the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is obtained. It is possible within the scope of the invention to vary the design of the active part areas; they do not have to be designed as oblong or circular areas as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The different areas can have any shapes which are suitable for achieving secure retention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to another suitable embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>), the landing zone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be designed as a laminate of a non-woven material or a plastic film and continuous fibers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, what is known as tow. The fibers can be straight, crimped or curled. In this case, the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> consists of the non-woven layer or the plastic film and the attachment means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the continuous fibers. The fibers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are fastened to the non-woven layer so that eyes or loops are formed, in which the attachment element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can engage. The continuous fibers can be produced separately before they are used in the process for manufacturing the landing zone. The fibers are often supplied in long fibre bundles or packs with a number of fibers arranged side by side. Before the fibers are fastened to the nonwoven layer, they should first be separated so that they are arranged lying in a plane essentially parallel side by side so that they can be attached to the non-woven layer in a suitable manner. This can be effected in the manufacturing process by, for example, the fibre bundle being stretched and spread out to form a layer of essentially uniform thickness. Another method may be to introduce a number of fibers arranged side by side in a plane into the manufacturing process. The continuous fibers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are then fastened together with the support means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in fastening areas <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, suitably along lines, at points or in spots, but the fibers are otherwise not fastened to one another. Fastening is brought about by, for example, ultrasonic welding or other thermal bonding with simultaneous compression. Other possible ways of fastening the fibers to the support means may be by means of binders or mechanical fibre entangling. By virtue of fastening the fibers only to the areas next to the short sides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the support means during manufacture, a landing zone according to the invention is obtained. Suitable materials for the fibers in the tow may be polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyester, polyvinyl acetate, cellulose acetate, regenerated cellulose fibers or bicomponent fibers. Examples of handling tow in manufacturing processes are given in, for example, European Patent Application EP 0 937 792 A1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> One or both of the components forming the laminate may also be made from a biodegradable material such as, for example, polylactide, polycaprolactone or other polyhydroxyalkanoates. A landing zone made entirely of a biodegradable material is in this way suitable for use in an absorbent product which can be composted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The invention is not to be considered as being limited to the embodiments above as these are intended only to explain the invention. The scope of the invention also includes combining characteristics from different embodiments with one another. It is also possible to use this type of landing zone on what are known as belt products. A belt product means a diaper or incontinence pad with an integral belt or belt segments for securing the diaper or incontinence pad on the wearer. The belts may also be detachable from the diaper or the incontinence pad. </paragraph>
