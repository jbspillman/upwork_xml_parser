<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor and, in particular but not exclusively, to a method of and an apparatus for manufacturing tantalum solid electrolytic chip capacitors for use in various electronic appliances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, with a tendency to reduce the weight and size, with a tendency to enhance the performance, and with the development of a packaging technique, the number of electronic appliances that are former into chips is rapidly increasing. Also, in the field of solid electrolytic capacitors, with a tendency to reduce the size and increase the capacity, the number of the solid electrolytic capacitors that are formed into chips is increasing. However, a further reduction in size and a further increase in capacity are demanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> depicts a conventional tantalum solid electrolytic chip capacitor, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> depict an essential portion of a tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor made by a conventional manufacturing method after assemblage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In these figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> denotes a capacitor element, which is a sintered porous body formed of powder of tantalum metal, one of valve action metals. An anode lead <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of a tantalum wire is partially embedded in and extends outwardly from the porous body. A dielectric oxide layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed on a portion of the anode lead <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and over the entire surface of the porous body by anodizing. An electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> such as manganese dioxide or the like is formed on the surface of the dielectric oxide layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a cathode layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is further formed on the electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The cathode layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a carbon layer and a silver paste layer laminated one upon another by dipping. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> denotes a Teflon-made insulating plate mounted on the anode lead <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to prevent an electrolyte from reaching and adhering to the anode lead <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> during formation of the electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> denotes an anode terminal, which is connected to the anode lead <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by welding and is bent after formation of a sheathing resin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (explained later). Reference numeral <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> denotes a cathode terminal electrically connected to the cathode layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a thermosetting conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> made of epoxy resin, which is cured by a hot-air circulating dryer. The cathode terminal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is bent after the molding of the sheathing resin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The sheathing resin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is covered over the entire capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the conventional tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor of the above-described construction, the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> used to connect the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the cathode layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is cured by the hot-air circulating dryer during batch processing wherein the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is allowed to stand for 90 minutes in an atmosphere of 180&plusmn;5&deg; C. Accordingly, such much time as about 6 hours is required from the start of assembling to the end of curing of the adhesive, including the time required for increasing the temperature of a product from when the product is introduced into the hot-air circulating dryer to when it reaches 180&plusmn;5&deg; C., the curing time of 90 minutes, and the annealing or slow cooling time up to when the product is taken out to the room temperature. According to this manufacturing method, the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is first discharged on the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then placed on the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is temporarily fixed by connecting the anode lead <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the anode terminal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the curing is carried out using the hot-air circulating dryer. Thus, the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is merely placed on the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which in turn comes to have a thickness of about 100 &mgr;m to about 500 &mgr;m, resulting in an increase in apparent resistance of the conductive adhesive itself. Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, it is likely that air is drawn into an interface between the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to create air bubble portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The presence of the air bubble portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> increases the connection resistance, deteriorating the electric characterietics (tan &dgr;/1 KHz or ESR/100 KHz) required for a capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, because the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is merely coated on the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the bonding area between the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the capacitor element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is-small and, hence, the bonding strength is low, resulting in insufficient reliability. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed to overcome the above-described disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an objective of the present invention to provide a method of and an apparatus for stably manufacturing tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors that are superior in electric characteristics (tan &dgr;/1 KHz or ESR/100 KHz). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another objective of the present invention is to provide the method and apparatus of the above-described type that are superior in productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accomplishing the above and other objective, the method according to the present invention comprises: preparing a length of metallic lead frame having a plurality of anode terminals and a plurality of cathode terminals; coating the plurality of cathode terminals with a thermosetting conductive adhesive; placing cathode layers of a plurality of capacitor elements on the conductive adhesive; placing anode leads <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> extending outwardly from the plurality of capacitor elements on the plurality of anode terminals respectively; joining the anode leads to the plurality of anode terminals respectively, by welding; applying a pressure to the plurality of capacitor elements so that a portion of the conductive adhesive is squeezed out of one surface of each of the plurality of capacitor elements to a neighboring side surface thereof joining the plurality of cathode terminals to the plurality of capacitor elements, respectively, by heat-curing the conductive adhesive; and covering the plurality of capacitor elements with a sheathing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described method, the pressure applied to the capacitor elements moves a portion of the conductive adhesive to the neighboring side surface of each capacitor element, thereby causing the conductive adhesive layer to have a reduced thickness. As a result, the resistance of the conductive adhesive in the thickness direction reduces considerably, and the adhesion properties between the surface of the cathode layer of the capacitor element and the surface of the cathode terminal are improved. Unlike the conventional method, any air bubbles are not produced and, hence, the electric characteristics (tan &dgr;/1 KHz or ESR/100 KHz) are improved. Moreover, the use of an adhesive that cures within a short time enables successive curing within the manufacturing apparatus, compared with the conventional batch processing by the use of a hot-air circulating dryer, thus enhancing the productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the pressure applied to the plurality of capacitor elements ranges from 2 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 9.5 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in terms of leakage current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, an epoxy-based adhesive is used for the conductive adhesive, and the conductive adhesive has a thickness smaller than 100 &mgr;m after the application of the pressure. The use of the epoxy-based adhesive enables curing within a very short time and enhances the productivity, and the reduced thickness of the conductive adhesive reduces the resistance of the conductive adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the apparatus according to the present invention includes a lower mold having an upper surface, on which a length of metallic lead frame having a plurality of anode terminals and a plurality of cathode terminals is to be placed, an upper mold mounted on the lower mold and having a lower surface spaced from the upper surface of the lower mold, and a heater mounted in the lower mold. The plurality of anode terminals are joined to respective anode leads extending outwardly from a plurality of capacitor elements, and the plurality of cathode terminals are coated with a thermosetting conductive adhesive, on which cathode layers of the plurality of capacitor elements are placed. When a pressure is applied to the plurality of capacitor elements by moving the upper mold toward the lower mold, a portion of the conductive adhesive is squeezed out of one surface of each of the plurality of capacitor elements to a neighboring side surface thereof, thus causing the conductive adhesive to have substantially a uniform thickness. Thereafter, the plurality of cathode terminals and the associated cathode layers of the plurality of capacitor elements are joined together by heat-curing the conductive adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the above-described construction facilitates the manufacture of the tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors and improves the quality thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The upper mold moves up and down relative to the lower mold. Alternatively, the upper mold is hingedly connected to the lower mold so as to pivot about a fulcrum. Such movement of the upper mold simplifies the construction of the apparatus and enhances the reliability of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, a water-repellent and heat-resistant sheet is attached to the upper surface of the lower mold. This sheet acts to prevent the cathode terminals from being bonded to the lower mold, even if the conductive adhesive is expelled from the cathode terminals, thus avoiding a reduction in productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Again advantageously, a heat-resistant elastic material is attached to the lower surface of the upper mold. The elastic material allows the capacitor elements to be appropriately pressed without directly applying the pressure thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a heater be mounted in the upper mold. The heater in the upper mold acts to prevent heat from radiating from the upper mold and to reduce the time required to reach the temperature at which the adhesive is cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is also preferred that a thermal insulating panel be disposed adjacent to the lower mold so as to confront a side surface thereof. The thermal insulating panel acts to prevent heat radiation from a heat source and to stabilize the temperature of the lower mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, a load regulating mechanism is provided for regulating a load to press the upper mold against the lower mold. The load regulating mechanism acts to optimize the load or pressure applied to the capacitor elements without damaging them.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a top force or upper mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a bottom force or lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> spaced from the upper mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an elastic material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> attached to the lower surface of the upper mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a water-repellent and heat resistant sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> such, for example, as a Teflon sheet attached to the upper surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, heaters <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted in the upper mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively, and a load regulating mechanism <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed on respective sides of the apparatus for regulating a load or pressure with which the upper mold is pressed against the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A heat-resistant silicone rubber having a rubber hardness of 5 to 15 under JIS K6249 is preferably used for the elastic material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The amount of displacement of the elastic material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is regulated or controlled in the range of 0.8 to 1.0 mm by the load regulating mechanism <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that an optimum load of 50 to 25 grams apiece may be applied to a plurality of capacitor elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> placed on the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The load regulating mechanism <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> employs air, oil, springs or the like to output a desired load or force. The heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be mounted in only the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors are manufactured in the following manner using the apparatus of the above-described construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A length of plated metallic lead frame having a plurality of anode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the same number of cathode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the anode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is first coated with the thermosetting conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at regular intervals (at locations where the cathode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided). Cathode layers (not shown) of a plurality of capacitor elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are then placed one after another on respective spots of the conductive adhesive. At the same time, an anode lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> extending outwardly from each capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed on the respective anode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and joined thereto by welding. Subsequently, under the condition in which the capacitor elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are pressed from above via the upper mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the cathode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the associated cathode layers of the capacitor elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are joined together by heat-curing the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at a temperature of 180&plusmn;5&deg; C. for 30 to 60 seconds. At this moment, because the Teflon sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is applied to the surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that is held in contact with the cathode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the bonding of the cathode terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that may be caused by the squeeze-out of the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that thermal insulating panels be disposed adjacent to the lower mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to confront the side surfaces thereof. It is further preferred that the thermal insulating panels be disposed adjacent to both the upper and lower mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to confront the side surfaces thereof. Such thermal insulating panels act to restrain the radiation of heat, making it possible to enhance the efficiency of heat-curing the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> depict a tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor made by the above-described method. In these figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a capacitor element, reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes an anode lead, reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes an insulating plate, reference numerals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>denote an anode terminal and a cathode terminal, respectively, reference numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> denotes a conductive adhesive, reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> denotes a dielectric oxide layer, reference numeral <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> denotes a solid electrolyte layer such as manganese dioxide, reference numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> denotes a cathode layer, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> denotes a sheathing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor of the above-described construction, while the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is held in pressure contact with the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the curing of the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is carried out. As a result, the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes uniformly thin such as to have a thickness (t) of, for example, 80 &mgr;m, and a portion thereof is squeezed out of one surface of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the neighboring side surface thereof, thus increasing the bonding area between the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In addition, the application of pressure expels air from between the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to thereby remove the air bubble portions such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> from the bonding area, making it possible to enhance the degree to which the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to each other. It is preferred that the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a thickness smaller than 100 &mgr;m after the application of the pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a change in leakage current characteristics caused by the application of pressure to the capacitor element, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts a change in bonding strength between the capacitor element and the cathode terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the leakage current can be reduced and made substantially constant by setting the pressure applied to the capacitor element in the range of 2 to 9.5 kglcm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If the pressure is lower than 2 kg lcm2, it is not possible to sufficiently squeeze the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the side surface of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or sufficiently prevent generation of the air bubble portions. As a result, slightly large leakage currents sometimes occur and, hence, the pressure setting lower than 2 kglcm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is not preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the application of a pressure over 9.5 kg lcm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>causes residual stress in the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thus deteriorating the leakage current characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, if the pressure applied to the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lower than 9.5 kglcm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the bonding strength between the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cathode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is substantially stable. However, if the pressure exceeds 9.5 kglcm2, the cathode layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed on the capacitor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is partially damaged or broken, thus considerably reducing the bonding strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph for comparing the equivalent series resistance (ESR 5 measured at 100 kHz) of the tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors manufactured in this embodiment with that of the conventional ones. The capacitance of samples was 10v100 &mgr;F and had a size 7343 (EIAJ code). A total of 200 samples were measured for each capacitor. As is clear from this graph, the average ESR value of 200 conventional capacitors is 120 m&OHgr;, while that of 200 capacitors according to the present invention is improved to 70 m&OHgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Also, in the tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors according to the present invention, the use of the conductive adhesive added with an increased amount of accelerator completed the curing within a very short time. By way of example, in manufacturing 100,000 capacitors of a size 7343 (EIAJ code), the batch processing in the conventional manufacturing method requires about 6 hours for the curing of the conductive adhesive, whereas the apparatus according to the present invention, when combined with the conventional assembly machine, can perform continuous production, making it possible to enhance the productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> depict an apparatus for manufacturing tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors according to a second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention is constructed ouch that the upper mold moves up and down relative to the lower mold, while the apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention is constructed such that an upper mold <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is hingedly connected to a lower mold <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to pivot about a fulcrum <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A load regulating mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is disposed at distal ends of the upper and lower molds <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> remote from the fulcrum <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Because the construction other than the above is the same, explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts the manner in which a length of lead frame <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having the anode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the cathode terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>integrally formed with each other extended between the upper and lower molds <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of capacitor elements placed thereon at regular intervals are bonded thereto simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The operation and effects of the apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention are substantially the same as those of the apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the above, according to the present invention, the capacitor elements are first placed on the conductive adhesive coated on the cathode terminals, and the conductive adhesive is heat-cured under the condition in which the capacitor elements are held under pressure. Accordingly, the conductive adhesive held in contact with one surface of each capacitor element is partially moved to a neighboring surface thereof, thus enlarging the bonding area and increasing the bonding strength. Furthermore, the thickness of the conductive adhesive layer is made uniformly thin, and generation of air bubbles inside the capacitors is prevented, making it possible to provide reliable tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors having a stable performance. Also, the use of a quick-drying conductive adhesive enhances the workability, and a combination of such adhesive with the apparatus according to the present invention simplifies the assembling processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention have been fully described by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted here that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications otherwise depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. and scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. </paragraph>
