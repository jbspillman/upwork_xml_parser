<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a kit and a method for making decorative articles, and more particularly, to a kit including a support and a plurality of colored elements to adhere to the support to form a decorative pattern. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known in the prior art to make decorative articles through the use of templates. U.S. Pat. No. 4,355,722 to Lemmeyer discloses a yarn coloring picture set and a method of coloring. In this patent, a picture receiving board is provided having an adhesive layer coated thereon. Sections of yarn are applied to the adhesive layer using a yarn pencil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,570,435 to Morrison discloses a method of making decorative articles employing yarn utilizing a base having a piercable elastic surface and a penetratable yieldable interior. Free ends of a yarn strand are pushed into the base in accordance with the picture thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 2,435,068 to Bellamy discloses a method of knitting design wherein the design of the knitted article is determined by knitting in succession units that may contain yarns of various characteristics such as color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is also known to provide a kit for craft use. U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,313 to Brundige discloses a needleworking kit that includes a graph marked in colors to indicate where stitches are to be made on the grid of a canvas. The kit also includes instructions, one or more needles of the type required for needlepoint design and a supply of yarns in colors called for by the design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of carpet, U.S. Pat. No. 3,285,797 to Harrison et al discloses a novel carpet construction wherein individual pile tufts extend through a backing fabric. The pile tufts are attached to the backing fabric using an adhesive and, optionally, a fusion treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned prior art has significant drawbacks in conjunction with kits and methods for making decorative articles. For example, the patents to Brundige, Morrison and Lemmeyer require the use of tools such as needles or other elongated implements for completing the decorative article. These tools require dexterity by a user and the ability to align the tool with a given pattern or form. Moreover, prior art patterns or templates also require complicated attachment features such as the perforated bases disclosed in the Morrison and Lemmeyer patents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A kit and method for making decorative articles, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,770 to Smith, teaches several improvements in this art. The kit includes a fabric grid, a multicolored template, yarn segments and an adhesive wherein the yarn segments are adhesively applied to the fabric grid according to the multicolored template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A continuing need exists, however, to provide a kit and a method for making decorative articles that is simple to assemble yet effective in producing a finished product and which avoids complicated tools and/or patterns to facilitate attachment of yarn-like material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the inventive kit a support is provided having a grid array. The support can comprise a variety of materials as known in the art of arts and crafts and any equivalent thereof. In an embodiment of the present invention, the support comprises a stiff material so that the support can be easily mounted on a wall or framed. For example the support can comprise at least one layer of foam having thereon at least on layer of paper, as in conventional foam board. Other examples of support materials include cardboard, cardstock, wood and the like. The support can have a length and a width of each of from about 6 inches to about 60 inches, e.g. from about 6 inches to about 36 inches and a thickness of about &frac18; to about 1 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The grid array can be printed on the support, mounted on the support, embossing or provided by other known methods. The grid array can cover the entire surface of the support or a portion thereof. In an embodiment of the present invention, a grid array containing a plurality segments where each segment contains a symbol or number therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>., grid array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, can be arranged in square segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The square segments can be identified by symbols <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contained therein. These symbols assist in visualizing the design contemplated in the finished decorative article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Still with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the grid array segments are sized to correspond to the tiles to put placed thereon and have an area of approximately &frac13; in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to about &frac12; in<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The tile dimension is only limited by the resolution desired in the finished article. In one aspect of the present invention, the tile area can be as low as &frac18; in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and as high as about &frac12; in<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In completing the decorative article a plurality of differently colored tiles can be placed on the plurality of segments of the grid array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The tiles can comprise any suitable material, as for example, paper, fabric, plastic, chip board, vinyl or any combination thereof and have a self adhesive backing, as such adhesive backings are known in the art.
