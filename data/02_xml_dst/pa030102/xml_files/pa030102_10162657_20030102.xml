<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a laminate made of fibrous layers for use in absorbent articles, such as sanitary towels, nappies or the like. The laminate includes an outer layer made of non-woven fabric, which is in contact with the wearer during use of the article, and an inner layer. The two layers may be interconnected in a first bonding pattern consisting of separate bonding points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Surface material for absorbent articles, such as sanitary towels, nappies or the like, means the layer which is located closest to the wearer and is in contact with the body of the wearer during use of the article. A surface material has many functional requirements, some of which are conflicting. The surface material is to feel soft and flexible to the wearer but must also be strong so as to withstand wear. It also should allow bodily fluid to rapidly pass through to the underlying absorbent body. The surface material also should prevent liquid which has been absorbed into the absorbent body from back-wetting the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventional surface materials in sanitary towels and nappies are non-woven fabrics, which are commercially available in a great many variants. Depending on the selection of fibers to be included in the non-woven material and the addition of any surface-active agents, such as wetting agents, the surface material is either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Also, the liquid permeability can be controlled by varying the degree of hydrophilicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,333,979 describes a surface material made of non-woven fabric, which is formed from thermoplastic fibers bonded in a pattern, and is embossed so as to provide the surface material with increased thickness, softness, bulk and strength. The non-woven material consists of what is known as spunbond with separate melt-bonding points lying closely together in a pattern of separate embossings. The material in question is stated to be a very effective surface material in disposable absorbent products, such as nappies, sanitary towels and the like. The production process entails a material web being bonded by passing it through a roller nip between a heated roller pair, one of the rollers consisting of a pattern roller for forming said melt-bonding points. The production process also comprises permanent embossing of said embossing pattern in a roller nip formed by two heated, mutually matching embossing rollers. U.S. Pat. No. 4,333,979 therefore describes a material web consisting of a single layer which, as mentioned above, is double-embossed, on the one hand for bonding the web and on the other hand for creating thickness and bulk. The material has very good strength properties, but at the expense of softness and flexibility, which are worse owing to the double embossing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Perforated non-woven fabric, that is to say fabric in which holes have been made so as to increase the liquid flow capacity, has also been available for a long time. An example of a perforated non-woven fabric is described in EP 235 309. The perforated non-woven material according to said publication consists of what is known as spunlace material with a high content of hydrophobic fibers. In a spunlace process, holes are formed in the material by means of water jets, which are sprayed against the material at high pressure. According to the publication, the spunlace material constitutes one of two layers forming the surface material and is intended to constitute the layer which is located closest to the wearer during use of the article. The aim is that the liquid be conducted through the holes and into the underlying layer. The spunlace material has a higher content of hydrophobic fibers than the underlying layer in the laminate. The fibers in the upper spunlace layer consist of 70% hydrophobic fibers and 30% hydrophilic fibers, while the underlying material layer consists of equal parts of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fibers. The underlying layer therefore has the capacity to drain liquid from the upper layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One problem with the material described in EP 235 309, however, is that holes which are formed by water jets are irregular in terms of both size and shape and have fibers which protrude from the edges of the holes and into the holes. These protruding fibers reduce the areas of the holes and capillary action draws the liquid into the material between the holes. The protruding fibre ends and the irregular shape and size of the holes considerably increase the risk of liquid remaining in the surface layer after wetting. Because even a small quantity of liquid on the surface material is sufficient to create a wet or soiled feeling for the wearer, this constitutes a major disadvantage of the material described in EP 235 309. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A similar material is described in EP 272 683 which also describes a surface material made of perforated non-woven fabric. In the disclosed fabric there are relatively loose fibers that are formed by perforating the non-woven material close to the holes that are intended to function as ducts for transporting liquid down to an underlying non-woven layer of what is known as the meltblown type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As long as the fibers in the perforated layer are arranged in such a manner that they conduct liquid down to an underlying layer, the surface material functions properly. However, it is a well-known fact that a non-woven material consists of irregularly shaped fibers, which are difficult to arrange in any particular direction. This means that fibers which are intended to transport liquid down to an underlying ply will also spread liquid over the surface of the non-woven material. Therefore, some of the liquid will remain in the surface material after wetting, and the article with the surface material in question will feel wet and unpleasant against the body of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another problem with the surface material, as described above is the difficulty of obtaining a well-defined hole size. From EP 409 535, for example, it is well-known that the size of the holes in the perforated material is critical for obtaining optimum liquid-permeability. In the case of a non-woven material, which has some areas with a dense fibrous structure and other areas with a less dense structure, it is difficult to achieve a uniform hole size throughout the material. This is due to the fact that holes in denser fibrous areas are smaller because they are surrounded by more fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, perforated non-woven materials in such previously known surface materials have a relatively low tensile strength because the hole-manufacturing process weakens the material. As strength is important to minimize the risk of the material breaking during manufacture or use, the low tensile strength is of course a major problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In EP 214 608, the holes are made in the non-woven material by means of hot needles, which heat the material to a temperature just below the melting point of the material. The holes made in the material therefore have a condensed portion of the fibrous material around each hole. The problems of varying hole size and weakening of the material are thus eliminated to a certain extent. On the other hand, the problem of liquid being able to spread in the surface material and remain in the fibrous structure persists. The denser structure around the holes is also intended to draw liquid down into underlying layers, but there is an obvious risk of liquid remaining in the dense hydrophilic fibrous structure around the holes. There is also a risk of liquid spreading in the capillaries of the non-woven material and as the non-woven layer is in direct contact with the wearer, this represents a major disadvantage. Another problem is that, because portions around the holes are melted, the surface material is stiff and uncomfortable for the wearer compared with material without condensed and partly melted portions around the holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In WO 9740793, it has been proposed, in conjunction with the hole-punching, to seal the area around each hole so as to reduce liquid spread in the lateral direction, each hole being surrounded by an essentially liquidtight edge. In this case, however, the problem remains that the material may feel relatively stiff and uncomfortable to the wearer in comparison to a similar material without these seals around the holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition to the use of non-woven fabrics, good results have been obtained in recent years using perforated films, that is to say plastic films with a large number of small holes which are designed to allow liquid through in one direction and prevent or reduce flow in the opposite direction. Good results in terms of low back-wetting have been achieved using such materials. An early example of such a film material is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,135. A later example of perforated plastic film is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,049. One disadvantage of perforated plastic films is that they have a plastic feel, which troubles many wearers who want softer material with a fibrous and textile feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It has been difficult to provide all the desired properties of a surface material in a single layer, and it is therefore now common to have surface materials in the form of laminates consisting of two or more layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve more rapid admission of liquid into the absorbent core of an absorbent product, and to create an insulating layer between the skin of the wearer and the absorbent core so as to prevent or at least reduce back-wetting, the surface material is now commonly combined with an underlying fibrous layer. An example of such a material combination is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,322. Another example is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,603, where a surface layer is supplemented by an underlying transport layer, said transport layer having a pore size which is smaller than the pore size in the surface layer. The latter publication states that such a material combination results in a higher liquid penetration rate and considerably lower back-wetting than a surface layer made only of, for example, spunbond. The surface layer in the absorbent article according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,603 can be perforated for better liquid penetration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the case of material combinations consisting of two or more layers closest to the wearer, it is important that the layers make good contact with one another so that insulating gaps do not occur between the outer and inner layers, because such a gap would constitute an impediment to liquid passing from one layer to the other. It is therefore necessary to bond the two layers together to form a laminate. This can be effected using bonding agent or by thermal bonding, for example ultrasonic bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The bonding together is often carried out at separate places in a bonding pattern, on the one hand in order not to constitute an impediment to liquid flow, and on the other hand in order that the laminate is not too stiff. Compared with a laminate without a bonding pattern, however, the laminate is relatively stiff and feels hard and uncomfortable to a wearer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is clear from the above that there is still a real need to improve laminates for use as surface layers on absorbent articles, such as sanitary towels, nappies or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The invention relates, but is not limited, to laminates of the type mentioned in the introduction that are soft and comfortable for the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The laminate according to one embodiment of the invention contains holes that are made at least through the outer layer in a hole pattern of separate holes, the hole pattern having more holes per unit area than the number of bonding points per unit area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One of the purposes of having the number of holes exceeding the bonding points between the outer and inner layers is to soften the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the invention, each of said holes is formed by arranging at least one slit through at least the outer layer and by pressing down an area thereby forming the respective hole opening from the outside of the layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this particular embodiment, the fact that the material penetration for the holes consists of slits, fibers in at least the outer layer are cut through at each slit, resulting in this layer being more open, soft and flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the present invention, each hole is formed by arranging two parallel slits delimiting the hole opening through at least the outer layer and by pressing down the rectangular area between the slits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, the outer layer consists of non-woven fabric with bonding points arranged in a second bonding pattern, where the second bonding pattern has fewer bonding points per unit area than the number of holes per unit area in said hole pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, the inner layer consists of a non-woven containing at least polyester fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further suitable embodiments emerge from the claims which follow.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a sanitary towel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a liquid-permeable laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a liquid tight layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the form of a polyethylene film, and an absorbent body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> arranged between the laminate and the liquid tight layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of an outer layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> made of non-woven fabric, which is in contact with the wearer during use of the sanitary towel, and an inner layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> made of a fibrous material. The two layers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> making up the laminate are interconnected in a first bonding pattern consisting of separate bonding points <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This connection of the two layers making up the laminate will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The expression bonding points is to be interpreted in such a way that the bonding points can have any shape and extent. For example, they can be in, but are not limited to, the form of a rhombus or a line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The outer layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> extends a little way outside the inner layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the laminate, around the entire periphery of the sanitary towel, and is outside the absorbent body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the liquid tight plastic layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> along an edge portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates diagrammatically the production of a laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> according to an embodiment of the invention. The outer layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the laminate is fed, together with the inner fibrous layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, to an ultrasound unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which can be of, but is not limited to, a conventional type and is not shown in greater detail. In the ultrasound unit, the two layers are bonded together in said bonding pattern consisting of separate bonding points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The bonded-together laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then fed to a perforating unit in the form of two rollers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which are intended to cut separated longitudinal incisions in the laminate for forming holes. As can be seen from an enlarged portion, the roller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has parallel knives <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which run all the way around and can be arranged on the periphery of the roller by milling. The counter-roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has peripheral teeth <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which engage in the material and, with their upper portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, press the laminate against the knives <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An example of a perforating arrangement of this type is described in greater detail in GB Patent No. 2 296 467. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows diagrammatically a piece of the laminate to illustrate how holes in the laminate are formed after it has been perforated by the perforating rollers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The hole, or rather the opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in the laminate is delimited by two parallel incisions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> cut by means of the knives <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After the incisions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have been cut, a hammock-like portion is formed by pressing down the material between the slits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of the teeth <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a hole which has been modified in relation to the hole according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and in which there is only one slit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an adjacent area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the laminate has been pressed by means of teeth of a different shape to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The holes themselves, in the laminate according to the embodiments shown, are shaped like segments of a circle and have been designated by reference number <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The outer layer in the laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, according to an embodiment of the invention, can consist of, but is not limited to, a spunbond non-woven. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a portion of an outer layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the laminate according to an embodiment of the invention. According to this embodiment, the outer layer consists of a spunbond made of polypropylene fibers which are thermally bonded in a regular pattern of separate squares, which have been designated by reference number <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also shows the separated slits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> described above. These are shown here in order to illustrate how in one embodiment of the invention slits are cut in the individual fibers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the spunbond material. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which is diagrammatic, only two of the slits have been drawn. Owing to the arrangement of the slits, the material is very open and also soft and flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The thermal bonding can be brought about by, but is not limited to, means of ultrasound. The pattern does not of course have to consist of a regular pattern of separate points, and other patterns and shapes are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which shows diagrammatically a portion of one embodiment of the whole laminate with inner and outer layers, the intention is again to illustrate how the slits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the laminate open it up for forming flow holes but also for softening the material. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the same reference numbers as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> have been used, reference number <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> indicating thermal bonding points in the bonding pattern of the outer spunbond layer. The slits through the material have been designated by reference number <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the spunbond fibers by reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, the inner layer consists of a carded synthetic wadding, comprising a mixture of PET fibers, PET/copolymer PET bonding fibers and PET/PP fibers. The wadding can be thermally bonded by means of hot air, what is known as through-air bonding. Alternative methods of bonding the wadding are by, but not limited to, needling, thermobonding, bonding using water jets, or bonding agents, such as latex. In these preferred embodiments the two layers are interconnected by means of a first bonding pattern, which consists of separate bonding points. These have been indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In the illustrative embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, bonding points of square shape have been selected, but other shapes are of course possible, for example rhombic or elongate bonding areas. These bonding points, which have according to one illustrative embodiment been brought about by means of ultrasound, are suitably larger in area than the thermal bonding points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the slits cut through fibers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and divide both the bonding points of the spunbond layer and the ultrasonically produced bonds <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which bond together the two layers making up the laminate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The size of the bonds <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the number of bonds per unit area in the respective bonding patterns for the outer layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> made of spunbond or other non-woven fabric and for the laminate can be varied as required by the intended properties with regard to durability and softness. The size of the slits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the number of slits per unit area can also be varied to control the openness in the laminate and also to control the desired softness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, bonding points of square shape have been selected, but other shapes are of course possible, for example, but not limited to, rhombic or elongate bonding areas. When relatively large bonding points are used, such as the square ones shown, it may be suitable, in conjunction with the ultrasonic bonding, to knurl the square bonding points to form smaller separate parts. This is effected by, for example, dividing each bonding point up into four smaller squares which are separated from one another by elongate areas, the outer plane of which does not coincide with said smaller squares. By knurling, it is possible to avoid large smooth areas being formed at the bonding points. Such large smooth areas could otherwise result in drops of liquid, such as menstrual fluid, adhering to these large areas and not being drawn into the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a method of manufacturing a laminate, which has been modified slightly in relation to that according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The perforating unit in the form of perforating rollers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> above, has in this case been arranged for perforation of only the spunbond material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Lamination of the outer perforated layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the inner fibrous layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is performed subsequently in the ultrasound unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The laminate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is therefore not as open as a laminate which has through-perforations, as described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> above. The open structure of the outer layer in the laminate, which open structure has been brought about by the perforations, the slits, through the spunbond layer results in this embodiment as well in a very soft surface material compared with previously known surface materials for use on absorbent articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The laminate according to the invention, is not limited to the illustrative embodiments described above, but a number of modifications are possible within the scope of the patent claims below. For example, the number of holes per unit area can be greater than the number of thermal bonding points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> per unit area in the spunbond layer, which produces a very soft and open material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As described above, the outer layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can consist of spunbond. Alternatively, the outer layer can consist of, but is not limited to, carded non-woven fabric. Spunbond and carded non-woven fabric can be bonded by hot air, that is to say what is known as through-air bonding, by needling, by thermobonding such as ultrasonic bonding, or means of water jets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In an illustrative embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each hole is formed by means of two adjacent parallel slits and by virtue of the material between the slits being pressed down so that hole openings which are essentially at right angles to the plane of the surface material are formed. This results in a very open surface material while obtaining softness by means of the slits. The holes in the outer layer can be made in another way. For example, the holes can consist of slits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a plane outer layer, that is to say the outer layer is not pressed down in the areas between adjacent slits. The holes can also have any other shape. The essential feature in this particular embodiment is that the fibers in the surface material are cut through so as to soften it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although only preferred embodiments are specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention. </paragraph>
