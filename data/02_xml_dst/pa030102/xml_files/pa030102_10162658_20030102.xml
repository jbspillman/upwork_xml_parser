<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a resorbable bone plate used for adherence to soft tissue. It comprises an upper surface, a curved lower surface for contacting a bone, a plurality of conical through holes connecting the upper surface with the lower surface for receiving bone screws, a central longitudinal axis and consists of a resorbable material. The curved lower surface has a radius of curvature R which is smaller than 10 mm. The ratio F/d of the total area F of the upper surface including the surface area of the through holes to the thickness d of the plate is in the range of 190 to 270 mm. The central part of the longitudinal plate has a generally constant width B and the width of the free ends of the longitudinal plate narrows to a value b&lt;0.3 B. The resorbable bone plate overcomes the problems of adherence of soft-tissue. Its shape and function is optimized given the limitations of the properties of these materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Bone plates made of titanium have shown that this material has such a bio-compatibility that soft-tissue is adhering thereto which can be in certain situations an undesirable property for bone plates. On the other hand bone plates made of bioresorbable materials usually have insufficient mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention as claimed aims at overcoming the problems of adherence of soft-tissue and to optimize shape and function of a resorbable plate given the limitations of the properties of these materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a resorbable bone plate used for adherence to soft tissue. It comprises an upper surface, a curved lower surface for contacting a bone, a plurality of conical through holes connecting the upper surface with the lower surface for receiving bone screws, a central longitudinal axis and consists of a resorbable material. The curved lower surface has a radius of curvature R which is smaller than 10 mm. The ratio F/d of the total area F of the upper surface including the surface area of the through holes to the thickness d of the plate is in the range of 190 to 270 mm. The central part of the longitudinal plate has a generally constant width B and the width of the free ends of the longitudinal plate narrows to a value b&lt;0.3 B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Resorbable materials to be used for the device according to the invention can be resorbable polymers like highly purified polyhydroxyacids, polysaccharides, polyamines, polyaminoacids, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyamidoesters, polydioxanone, polyesteramides, copolyoxalates, polycarbonates or poly(glutamic-co-leucine). Preferably polylactides are used or their combinations with polyhydroxybutyrates or polyhydroxyvalerates and/or resorbable glasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other useful polyhydroxyacids comprise polycaprolactone, poly(L-lactide), poly(DL-lactide), polyglycolide, poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide), poly(DL-lactide-co-caprolactone). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Preferably the lower surface of the bone plate has a radius of curvature R which is smaller than 9 mm. The axis of the hollow cylinder corresponding to the curved plate is running parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the plate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably the ratio F/f of the total area F of the upper surface (including the surface area of the through holes) to the true surface f of the upper surface (excluding the surface area of the through holes) is in the range of 1.10-1.25. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The width of the free ends of the longitudinal plate is narrowing to value b being preferably smaller than 0.15 B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The upper surface of the bone plate has preferably a roughness of 0.5 &mgr;m to 5.0 &mgr;m, typically of 0.6 &mgr;m to 2.5 &mgr;m in order to avoid the adherence of soft tissue after implantation. In any case it is preferred that the upper surface is smoother than the lower surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably the bone plate is provided with a torsion around its central longitudinal axis which allows application to the required bone profile. The degree of torsion of the bone plate is preferably between &plusmn;1&deg; to &plusmn;20&deg; over the total length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The length <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the central part of the longitudinal plate corresponds preferably to 73-82% of the total length L of the plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve better angular stability selected or all of the conical through holes may be provided with a thread. However, it is also possible to use through holes with a smooth inner surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The through holes have preferably a cone angle of 15&deg; to 25&deg;, typically of 18&deg; to 22&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The bone plate is provided preferably with n&gE;4 holes (more preferably with n &gE;6 holes), whereby the two most centrally located holes have preferably a distance which is at least 150%, preferably 180% of the distance x between the other through holes. When the central part of the plate is reinforced by omitting the most central hole (or holes) maximum rigidity of the cross section is obtained which is important for the bridging of bone defects.</paragraph>
