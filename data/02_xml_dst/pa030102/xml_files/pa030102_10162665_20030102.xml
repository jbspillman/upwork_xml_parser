<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an azimuth propeller device. More specifically, the present invention relates to an azimuth propeller device which may be attached to the bottom of a ship to drive and steer the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a conventional ship is provided with a propeller and a rudder separately provided with the propeller, which are attached to the stem of the ship so that the driving force for the ship is exerted by the propeller, and operations, such as turning of the ship, are performed by the rudder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, however, the propeller used for driving the ship and the rudder used for operating the ship are integrated, and an azimuth propeller device, simply called an azimuth propeller, which is attached to the ship to be rotatable in the vertical direction of the ship, has been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The structure of a conventional azimuth propeller device will be briefly described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>A and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing an attachment of an azimuth propeller device at the stern portion of a ship. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the right hand side view of the azimuth propeller device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a cross-sectional view of the azimuth propeller device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> taken along the line F-F. In the figures, the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates an azimuth pod, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> indicates a shaft, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> indicates a current plate member, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> indicates a propeller member, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> indicates an azimuth propeller device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figures, the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotatably attached to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which exerts the driving force for the ship, may be attached to the front or back of the azimuth device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accommodates a propeller drive mechanism (not shown in the figures) in the inside thereof. The current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is integrally fixed to the upper portion of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and has a streamline cross sectional shape. The current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached to the lower portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which extends in the vertical direction, and the upper portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is coupled with a driving mechanism (not shown in the figures), which is disposed in the hull so that the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are integrally rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By using the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the above described structure, it becomes possible to drive the ship using the driving force generated by rotating the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and to obtain steering function by rotating the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with respect to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to change the travelling course of the ship. Note that a motor used for outputting the driving force for the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be disposed in the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or in the hull of the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the conventional azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above, however, it is necessary, in order to maintain the direction of the ship, i.e., a course of the ship in a straight line, to frequently change the angle of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> within a relatively small angle range so that the direction of the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be varied to finely adjust the direction of the ship. Moreover, when making a turn, it is necessary to rotate the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a large angle to change the direction of the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In addition, when making an emergency stop, it is required to counterrotate the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to stop the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For these reasons, it is necessary to frequently actuate a large driving mechanism in order to rotate the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is large and heavy. Accordingly, a further improvement in the conventional azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been awaited from the viewpoints of reducing energy consumption, improving durability, and decreasing manufacturing cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention takes into consideration the above-mentioned circumstances, and has as an object to provide an azimuth propeller device which is capable of maintaining the course of a ship without rotating the entire azimuth propeller device, and the steering force thereof is further improved when making a ship turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides an azimuth propeller device including: a current plate member; an azimuth pod fixed to a lower portion of the current plate member, the azimuth pod being provided with a propeller member; and an auxiliary steering member provided with the current plate member, wherein the current plate member and the azimuth pod are provided so as to be rotatable together along a vertical axis with respect to the bottom of a ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the auxiliary steering member is a rear flap member rotatably attached to a trailing edge portion of the current plate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the auxiliary steering member is a front flap member rotatably attached to a front edge portion of the current plate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the auxiliary steering member is a front flap member rotatably attached to a front edge portion of the current plate member, and a rear flap member rotatably attached to a trailing edge portion of the current plate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an azimuth propeller device including: a current plate member; an azimuth pod fixed to the lower portion of the current plate member, the azimuth pod being provided with a propeller member; a vertical stabilizer disposed at a lower portion of the azimuth pod; and a trailing edge flap member rotatably attached to a rear edge portion of the vertical stabilizer, wherein the current plate member and the azimuth pod are provided so as to be rotatable together along a vertical axis with respect to the bottom of a ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the auxiliary steering member is a pair of open-close flap members attached to a side wall portion of the current plate member, the pair of open-close flap members being disposed so as to open and close independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the pair of open-close flap members are fully opened to make an emergency stop of a ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the auxiliary steering member set forth above is combined with another auxiliary steering member described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides the above azimuth propeller device further including: a pair of open-close members attached to a side wall portion of the vertical stabilizer, the pair of open-close flap members being disposed so as to open and close independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the azimuth propeller device described above, since an auxiliary steering member is provided with the current plate member of the azimuth propeller device, it becomes possible to maintain the direction of a ship by the operation of the auxiliary steering member, without the necessity of operating the whole azimuth propeller device, and hence, the straightness of the travel of the ship can be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, since the steering force of the azimuth propeller device can be improved by operating the auxiliary steering member, a desired turning of the ship can be made by decreasing the steering angle of the azimuth propeller device as compared with the case where only the azimuth propeller device is used to make a ship turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, power required for the operation of the azimuth propeller device according to the present invention can be decreased as compared with a conventional azimuth propeller device, the entire body of which is operated to make, for instance, a ship turn. Therefore, remarkable effects, such as reduction in cost and improvement in durability, can be obtained according to the azimuth propeller device of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, the azimuth propeller device further includes at least one radiation member provided with an outer periphery of the azimuth pod, wherein the propeller member is a POD propeller member provided with the azimuth pod, and a motor which drives the POD propeller member is provided inside the azimuth pod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the radiation member is a fin extending in the front and back direction of the azimuth pod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, the fin is twisted in the rotation direction of the POD propeller member from the front to back of the fin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the above azimuth propeller device, since at least one radiation member is provided with the outer periphery of the azimuth pod, it becomes possible to effectively release the heat, which is generated by the rotation of the motor inside the azimuth pod, into the surrounding water via the radiation member. That is, it becomes possible to effectively carry out a water-cooling operation using water of the ocean, a river, a lake, etc., in which the ship is traveling, and hence the air cooling operation can be eliminated or decreased to a minimum level. Accordingly, it has a remarkable effect on the reduction in the size and cost of the azimuth propeller device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also, since at least one of the fins extending in the front and back direction of the azimuth pod is adopted as a radiation member, it becomes possible to secure a large heat transfer area to improve the radiation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the fin is twisted in the rotation direction of the POD propeller member from the front to back of the fm, water flow adjusting effect can be obtained in addition to the above-mentioned radiation effect. Accordingly, the present invention can also contribute to the improvement in the driving force.</paragraph>

That is, the timing, the direction, and the angle for pivoting the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are controlled to be interlocked with the rotation angle or the driving force of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E having the above-mentioned structure is capable of driving a ship using the driving force generated by rotating the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and obtaining steering function by rotating the whole azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E including the vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with respect to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to change the course of travel of the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Also, when the ship travels in a certain direction, it becomes possible to maintain the direction of the ship by appropriately pivoting the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. That is, the ship provided with the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E can suitably travel in a straight line by the operation of only the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which is significantly smaller in size and weight compared with the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E, without the necessity of rotating the entire azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E within a small angle range by using a huge driving mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the ship makes a turn, if the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is rotated in accordance with the rotation direction of the ship, in addition to the rotation of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E, the steering force for the ship can be further improved as compared with the case where only the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E is employed. That is, according to this embodiment of the present invention provided with the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a desired turning of the ship can be made by using substantially the same steering force although the steering angle of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E required is made smaller as compared with the case where only the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E is employed. Further, when making a turn of relatively small turning angle (i.e., a large turning radius), only the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may need to be operated, and it is not necessary to rotate the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E at all, to obtain a required steering force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Note that when the ship makes a turn, the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is rotated in the same direction as the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E. That is, when the ship makes a right turn with respect to its traveling direction, the trailing edge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>E is rotated in the right hand side direction and the rear end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is also rotated in the right hand side direction with respect to the traveling direction of the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> fixed to the bottom of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has an advantage in that the disturbance in the water flow in the vicinity of the bottom of the ship can be minimized even if the steering operation is carried out by using the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> since the distance between the bottom of the ship and the vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is relatively large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Also, it becomes easy to design the structure for providing the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, since space can be easily secured on and in the vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, a sixth embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates an azimuth pod, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> indicates a shaft, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> indicates a current plate member, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> indicates a propeller member, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates a rear flap member, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F indicates an azimuth propeller device, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L indicate (right and left) open-close flap members. Elements which are the same as those described in the first through fourth embodiments are indicated using the same numerals, and the explanations thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F according to the sixth embodiment is formed by combining the first and fourth embodiments according to the present invention described above, and the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R are provided as auxiliary steering members. As mentioned above, the operation of the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members are controlled to be linked with the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> OF having the above-mentioned structure is capable of driving a ship using the driving force generated by rotating the propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and obtaining steering function by rotating the whole azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F with respect to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to change the course of travel of the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Also, when the ship travels in a certain direction, it becomes possible to maintain the direction of the ship by appropriately pivoting the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R, and a ship provided with the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F can suitably travel in a straight line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the ship makes a turn, if the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R are rotated in accordance with the rotation direction of the ship, in addition to the rotation of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F, the steering force for the ship can be further improved as compared with the case where only the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F is employed. That is, according to this embodiment of the present invention provided with the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R, a desired turning of the ship can be made by using substantially the same steering force although the steering angle of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F required is made smaller as compared with the case where only the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F is used. Further, when making a turn of relatively small turning angle (i.e., a large turning radius), only the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R may need to be operated, and it is not necessary to rotate the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>F at all, to obtain a required steering force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The operations of the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R, when the ship makes a turn, are the same as those described in the first and the fourth embodiment described above, and a further improvement in the straightness of the travel and steering of the ship can be expected by combining the operations of the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Also, when making an emergency stop of the ship, the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R may be rotated 90 degrees in the right hand side and left hand side direction, respectively, with respect to the travelling direction of the ship, thereby forming a plate-shaped resistance member orthogonal to the traveling direction of the ship in order to shorten the traveling distance required for the ship to make an emergency stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, a seventh embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>G according to the seventh embodiment is formed by combining the second and fourth embodiments of the present invention described above. That is, in the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>G, a structure is adopted in which the front flap member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> are combined so that a further improvement in the straightness of the travel and steering of the ship can be expected by combining the operations of the two members <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, when making an emergency stop of the ship, the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R may be rotated 90 degrees in the right hand side and left hand side direction, respectively, with respect to the direction of travel of the ship, thereby forming a plate-shaped resistance member orthogonal to the direction of the travel of the ship in order to shorten the traveling distance required for the ship to make an emergency stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Next, an eighth embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>H according to the eighth embodiment is formed by combining the third and fourth embodiments of the present invention described above. That is, in the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>H, a structure is adopted in which the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the front flap member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> are combined so that a further improvement in the straightness in the travel and steering of the ship can be expected by combining the operations of the members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Also, when making an emergency stop of the ship, the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R may be rotated at 90 degrees in the right hand side and left hand side direction, respectively, with respect to the travelling direction of the ship, and the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the front flap member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be operated in the opposite directions, thereby forming two plate-shaped resistance members orthogonal to the traveling direction of the ship in order to shorten the traveling distance required for the ship to make an emergency stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, a ninth embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>I according to the ninth embodiment is formed by combining the fourth and fifth embodiments of the present invention described above. That is, in the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>I, a structure is adopted in which the vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the trailing edge flap member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> and the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> are combined so that a further improvement in the straightness in the travel and steering of the ship can be expected by combining the operations of the members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Also, when making an emergency stop of the ship, the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R may be rotated 90 degrees in the right hand side and left hand side direction, respectively, with respect to the travelling direction of the ship, thereby forming a plate-shaped resistance member orthogonal to the traveling direction of the ship in order to shorten the traveling distance required for the ship to make an emergency stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the azimuth propeller device of the present invention, since the auxiliary steering member(s) is provided, it becomes possible to obtain excellent straightness in the travel of the ship without the necessity of operating the entire azimuth propeller device, and to improve the steering function of the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Also, by using the open-close flap members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>R and/or the rear flap member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the front flap member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to shorten the traveling distance required for the ship to make an emergency stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Next, a tenth embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>J according to the tenth embodiment is formed by combining the first embodiment of the present invention described above with a (plurality of) radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (i.e., a radiation member). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>J includes the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accommodating a motor for driving the POD propeller (not shown in the figures) in the inside thereof, to which the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that exerts the driving force for the ship by driving water backwards, is attached to the front or back thereof (back in the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, a number of radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are attached to the outer periphery of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to extend therefrom. Each of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a plate-like member extending in the front-to-back direction of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e., the travelling direction by the driving force of the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is preferable to use a member having excellent thermal conductivity for the radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Note that although eighteen of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are radially attached to the outer periphery of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with an equal interval between each other, the present invention is not limited to this particular configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>J having the above-mentioned structure, heat generated from the motor (not shown in the figures) for rotating the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transmitted to each of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the wall of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is released into the surrounding water from the surface of each radiation fin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. That is, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cooled by means of a water-cooling system via the radiation fins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention. For this reason, components required in an air-cooling system of a conventional art, such as a power source for the air-cooling system, a driving source for actuating an impelling means, such as a fan, and a passage for the cooling air, become unnecessary, and hence, not only can the space, energy consumption, and cost be reduced, but also the durability and the reliability of the azimuth propeller device can be improved according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Also, if the entire heating value cannot be covered by the water-cooling system of the embodiment of the present invention, such as for the case where the heating value of the motor is large, it is possible to use the water-cooling system of the present invention together with the conventional air-cooling system. In such a case, since the burden for the air-cooling system can be eased as compared with that in the conventional system, the size of the fan or of the passage for the cooling air can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Next, the eleventh embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>. Note that elements which are the same as those described in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 10B</cross-reference> are indicated by using the same numerals, and the explanations thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>K according to the eleventh embodiment is formed by combining the first embodiment of the present invention described above with a current plate fin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is adopted as a radiation member. The current plate fin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by, in general, twisting the above-mentioned fin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the rotation direction of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the front to the back thereof. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>, the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> rotates in a clockwise direction viewed from the front (in the traveling direction) of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>K as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, and each of the current plate fins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is angled or inclined from the front toward the back. The inclination is due to the twist of the current plate fin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as to upturn the tail portion of the current plate fin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the rotation direction of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with respect to the axis of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. That is, an inclination surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the current plate fin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed along the flow of water which is drawn by the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> If the current plate fins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the above-mentioned structure are adopted, it becomes possible to obtain water flow adjusting function for the water drawn by the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in addition to the above-mentioned water-cooling function. Accordingly, it becomes possible to decrease the loss, and hence, the driving force exerted by the rotating the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Note that the structures of the azimuth propeller device according to the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to those described above, and can be modified within the scope of the present invention. For instance, the structure according to any one of the second to ninth embodiments of the present invention can suitably be combined with the radiation member described in the tenth or eleventh embodiment of the present invention. Also, a member having an excellent thermal conductive property may be intervened between the azimuth pod and the motor so as to further enhance the thermal conduction from the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Having thus described example embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent that various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. For instance, a front flap member may be provided also with the vertical stabilizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements, though not expressly described above, are nonetheless intended and implied to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing discussion is intended to be illustrative only; the invention is limited and defined only by the following claims and equivalents thereto. </paragraph>
