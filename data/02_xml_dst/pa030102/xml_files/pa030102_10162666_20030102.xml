<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an azimuth propeller device. More specifically, the present invention relates to an azimuth propeller device including a motor for driving a POD propeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a conventional ship is provided with a propeller and a rudder separately provided with the propeller, which are attached to the stem of the ship so that the driving force for the ship is exerted by the propeller, and operations, such as turning of the ship, are performed by the rudder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, however, the propeller used for driving the ship and the rudder used for operating the ship are integrated, and an azimuth propeller device, simply called an azimuth propeller, which is attached to the ship to be rotatable in the vertical direction of the ship, has been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The structure of a conventional azimuth propeller device will be briefly described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing an attachment of an azimuth propeller device at the stem portion of a ship. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a partial cross-sectional view of the right hand side of the azimuth propeller device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a cross-sectional view of the azimuth propeller device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> taken along the line A-A. In the figures, the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates an azimuth pod, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> indicates a shaft, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> indicates a current plate member, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> indicates a POD propeller member, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates a propeller shaft, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> indicates a stator, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> indicates a rotor, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> indicates a motor, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> indicates an azimuth propeller device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figures, the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotatably attached to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which exerts the driving force for the ship, may be attached to the front or back of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accommodates a propeller drive mechanism, such as the motor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, in the inside thereof. The current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is integrally fixed to the upper portion of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and has a streamline cross sectional shape. The current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached to the lower portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which extends in the vertical direction, and the upper portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is coupled with a driving mechanism (not shown in the figures), which is disposed in the hull so that the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are integrally rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By using the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the above mentioned structure, it becomes possible to drive the ship using the driving force generated by rotating the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and to obtain steering function by rotating the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with respect to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to change the travelling course of the ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Note that there are two types for the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. One in which the motor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for outputting a driving force for the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed in the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, and the other in which a driving force is received from a driving source (not shown in the figures), such as a motor, disposed in the hull. The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> has a structure in which the rotor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is rotated together with the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with respect to the stator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is fixed to the inside wall of the hollow azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In order to handle the heat generated by driving the motor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an air-cooling system, in which cooling air supplied into the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the hull is circulated, is adopted for the conventional azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For the above-mentioned air-cooling system for the azimuth propeller device, however, since it forcibly circulates the cooling air, a number of components become necessary, such as a source supply of the cooling air, a passage for the cooling air, an impelling means such as a fan for the cooling air, and a driving source for actuating the impelling means. For this reason, it becomes necessary, from the viewpoint of structure, to secure space for installing the passage, the impelling means, etc., in at least one of the azimuth propeller device and the hull. Accordingly, this is disadvantageous in terms of decreasing the size or cost of the azimuth propeller device. In addition, since power is consumed for the cooling system, the running cost is also increased. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention takes into consideration the above-mentioned circumstances, and has as an object to provide an azimuth propeller device which is capable of completely eliminating the necessity of cooling the motor, etc., using the air-cooling system or keeping it down to a minimum level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides an azimuth propeller device including: an azimuth pod; a POD propeller member provided with the azimuth pod; a motor which drives the POD propeller member, the motor being provided inside the azimuth pod; and at least one radiation member provided with an outer periphery of the azimuth pod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the radiation member is a fin extending in the front and back direction of the azimuth pod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, the fin is twisted in the rotation direction of the POD propeller member from the front to back of the fin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the above azimuth propeller device, since at least one radiation member is provided with the outer periphery of the azimuth pod, it becomes possible to effectively release the heat, which is generated by the rotation of the motor inside the azimuth pod, into the surrounding water via the radiation member. That is, it becomes possible to effectively carry out a water-cooling operation using water of the ocean, a river, a lake, etc., in which the ship is traveling, and hence the air cooling operation can be eliminated or decreased to a minimum level. Accordingly, it has a remarkable effect on the reduction in the size and cost of the azimuth propeller device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, since at least one of the fins extending in the front and back direction of the azimuth pod is adopted as a radiation member, it becomes possible to secure a large heat transfer area to improve the radiation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the fin is twisted in the rotation direction of the POD propeller member from the front to back of the fin, water flow adjusting effect can be obtained in addition to the above-mentioned radiation effect. Accordingly, the present invention can also contribute to the improvement in the driving force.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention summarized above and defined by the enumerated claims may be better understood by referring to the following detailed description, which should be read with reference to the accompanying drawings. This detailed description of particular preferred embodiments, set out below to enable one to build and use particular implementations of the invention, is not intended to limit the enumerated claims, but to serve as particular examples thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The azimuth propeller device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. Note that in the following figures, elements which are the same as those described in the prior art are indicated by using the same numerals, and the explanations thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the azimuth propeller device according to the first embodiment of the present embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates an azimuth pod, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> indicates a shaft, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> indicates a current plate member, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> indicates a POD propeller member, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A indicates an azimuth propeller device, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> indicates a (plurality of) radiation fins (i.e., a radiation member). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figures, the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is rotatably attached to the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this specification, the term &ldquo;the rear portion of the ship&apos;s bottom&rdquo; means a portion of the bottom of a ship which is located at the back of a hull with respect to the direction of travel of the ship. Accordingly, the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is located beneath the surface of the water of the ocean, a river, a lake, etc., in which the ship travels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A includes the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accommodating a motor for driving the POD propeller (not shown in the figures) in the inside thereof, to which the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that exerts the driving force for the ship by driving water backwards, is attached to the front or back thereof (back in the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). The current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a streamlined cross sectional shape is integrally fixed to the upper portion of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached to the lower portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which extends in the vertical direction, and the upper portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is coupled with a driving mechanism (not shown in the figures), which is disposed in the hull so that the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the current plate member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be integrally rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a number of radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are attached to the outer periphery of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to extend therefrom. Each of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a plate-like member extending in the front-to-back direction of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e., the travelling direction by the driving force of the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is preferable to use a member having excellent thermal conductivity for the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Note that although eighteen of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are radially attached to the outer periphery of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with an equal interval between each other, the present invention is not limited to this particular configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A having the above-mentioned structure, heat generated from the motor (not shown in the figures) for rotating the POD propeller member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transmitted to each of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the wall of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is released into the surrounding water from the surface of each radiation fin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. That is, the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cooled by means of a water-cooling system via the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. For this reason, components required in the above conventional art, such as a power source for the air-cooling system, a driving source for actuating the impelling means, and a passage for the cooling air, become unnecessary, and hence, not only can the space, energy consumption, and cost be reduced, but also the durability and the reliability of the azimuth propeller device can be improved according to the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also, if the entire heating value cannot be covered by the water-cooling system of the embodiment of the present invention, such as for the case where the heating value of the motor is large, it is possible to use the water-cooling system of the present invention together with the conventional air-cooling system. In such a case, since the burden for the air-cooling system can be eased as compared with that in the conventional system, the size of the fan or of the passage for the cooling air can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, a modified example of the above-mentioned embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. Note that elements which are the same as those described in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> are indicated by using the same numerals, and the explanations thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this modified embodiment, a current plate fin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adopted as a radiation member. The current plate fin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by, in general, twisting the above-mentioned fin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the rotation direction of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the front to the back thereof. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> rotates in a clockwise direction viewed from the front (in the traveling direction) of the azimuth propeller device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, and each of the current plate fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is angled or inclined from the front toward the back. The inclination is due to the twist of the current plate fin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to upturn the tail portion of the current plate fin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the rotation direction of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with respect to the axis of the azimuth pod <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. That is, an inclination surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the current plate fin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed along the flow of water which is drawn by the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> If the current plate fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the above-mentioned structure are adopted, it becomes possible to obtain water flow adjusting function for the water drawn by the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in addition to the above-mentioned water-cooling function. Accordingly, it becomes possible to decrease the loss, and hence, the driving force exerted by the rotating the POD propeller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Note that the structures of the azimuth propeller device according to the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to those described above, and can be modified within the scope of the present invention. For instance, a member having an excellent thermal conductive property may be intervened between the azimuth pod and the motor so as to further enhance the thermal conduction from the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Having thus described example embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent that various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements, though not expressly described above, are nonetheless intended and implied to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing discussion is intended to be illustrative only; the invention is limited and defined only by the following claims and equivalents thereto. </paragraph>
