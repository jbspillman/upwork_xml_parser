<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to transflective electro-optical devices which can interchangeably perform reflective display by using external light and transmissive display via light-source light. The invention also relates to an electronic apparatus provided with such a device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a transflective electro-optical device, such as a transflective liquid crystal display device, reflective display is performed in a bright place by using external light while a light source is turned off. In a dark place, transmissive display is performed by using light emitted from the light source that is turned on. In particular, reflective display is performed by having incident external light reflected off of areas of a transflective film other than slits provided therein, which are used for light transmission, to the exterior of the device via an electro-optical material layer formed of liquid crystals or the like. On the other hand, transmissive display is performed by transmitting light emitted from a light source provided at a back side of a transflective film, and by emitting this transmitted light to the exterior of the device via the electro-optical material layer formed of liquid crystals or the like. This type of transflective electro-optical device has been widely used as a display device of a portable electronic apparatus, such as a mobile phone, since there is a strong demand for electrical power conservation, and in addition, this type of device may be optionally used in a dark place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition, a color reflective electro-optical device, which performs color display by using color filters (hereinafter &ldquo;selective-transmission color filter&rdquo;) formed of resin materials colored by dyes or pigments, has also been developed. However, this type of color filter has been formed so that each pixel selectively transmits light in a predetermined wavelength range and selectively absorbs light outside of that range, and hence, the optical efficiency for this type of color reflective electro-optical device is basically low. Accordingly, when color reflective display is performed by this type of selective-transmission color filter using external light that only has a limited light intensity, the brightness of the display is generally decreased. Accordingly, in order to create a bright color reflective display, a method in which light in a predetermined wavelength range is not selectively transmitted but is selectively reflected has also been developed. For example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 8-304626, 9-146088, and 2000-231097, cholesteric liquid crystal and a color filter (hereinafter &ldquo;selective-reflection color filter&rdquo;) which selectively reflects light in a predetermined wavelength range by using a polymer film or the like have been disclosed. According to the techniques disclosed in these publications, by increasing the optical efficiency of external light, a bright, color reflective display can be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the selective-reflection color filter described above is applied to the transflective electro-optical devices, a bright reflective display can be created. However, when transmissive display is performed, light-source light which is selectively transmitted through the selective-reflection color filter, that is, light with a color complementary with respect to the color of light that is selectively reflected, is transmitted through the selective-reflection color filter as light-source light, and then the light is emitted to the exterior of the device. That is, when transmissive display is performed, a display in colors, that are complementary to those of a reflective display, is created. Accordingly, when a display device is formed so that the color tones are normally displayed in color reflective display, a problem may arise in that the color tones are abnormally displayed in color transmissive display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a result, according to any of the techniques described above, there has been a problem, which is difficult to address or solve, in that a color display having normal color tones and a bright, color reflective display cannot be compatible with each other in a transflective electro-optical device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the problems discussed above, and provides a transflective electro-optical device which can create a color transmissive display having normal color tones and a bright, color reflective display. The invention also provides an electronic apparatus provided with this transflective electro-optical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, a transflective electro-optical device of the present invention includes an electro-optical material provided between a pair of substrates; display electrodes provided on at least one of the pair of substrates at an electro-optical material side; a first color filter provided on one substrate of the pair of substrates at the electro-optical material side, the first color filter having a selective-reflection region in each pixel that selectively reflects light in a predetermined wavelength range and a light-transmission region in each pixel that transmits light outside of the predetermined wavelength range; a light-shielding film provided at an opposite side of the first color filter from the electro-optical material so as to be opposed to the selective-reflection regions; a second color filter provided at the opposite side of the first color filter from the electro-optical material so as to be opposed to the light-transmission regions, the second color filter having a selective-transmission region in each pixel that selectively transmits light in the predetermined wavelength range; and a light-source provided at the opposite side of the second color filter from the electro-optical material. The other one substrate of the pair of substrates that is opposed to the first color filter, with the electro-optical material provided therebetween, is a transparent substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, where reflective display is performed in a bright place, the light-source is placed in an OFF state, that is, a state in which light-source light is not emitted. In this state, after passing through the electro-optical material, external light that is incident on the transparent substrate is reflected off of the selective-reflection regions of the first color filter, and is then emitted from the transparent substrate side. In the step described above, in the first color filter, light in the predetermined wavelength range, such as R (red), G (green), or B (blue), is selectively reflected in each pixel. The first color filter described above is formed of cholesteric liquid crystal, a hologram, a dychroic mirror, or the like, which are commonly known. Accordingly, for example, where a polarizer is provided on the transparent substrate, and where an electro-optical material, such as liquid crystal, is driven by display electrodes provided for the substrate, reflective display exhibiting a plurality of colors, such as RGB colors, can be performed on the transparent substrate side used as a display screen by using external light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, where transmissive display is performed in a dark place, the light-source is placed in an ON state, that is, a state in which light-source light is emitted. In this state, after light-source light that is emitted form the light-source passes through the selective-transmission regions of the second color filter and, almost at the same time, passes through areas at which the light-shielding film is not provided, the light-source light further passes through the light-transmission regions of the first color filter, and is then emitted from the transparent substrate side through an electro-optical material. In the step described above, in the second color filter, light in the predetermined wavelength range, such as R, G, or B, is selectively transmitted in each pixel. The second color filter described above is formed of known color filters in which resin materials are colored by dyes or pigments. Accordingly, for example, where a polarizer is provided on each substrate, and where an electro-optical material, such as liquid crystal, is driven by display electrodes provided for the substrate, transmissive display exhibiting a plurality of colors, such as RGB colors, can be performed on the transparent substrate side used as a display screen by using light-source light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Next, a case is discussed in which color display is also performed by using the first color filter when transmissive display is performed, that is, the case in which the second color filter, the light-shielding film, and the light-transmission regions of the first color filter, described in the present invention, are not provided. Since light-source light selectively transmitted through the first color filter is emitted from the transparent substrate side, where transmissive display is performed, colors in complementary relationships with those of a reflective display are displayed in corresponding pixels, respectively. On the other hand, in the present invention, since the second color filter and the light-shielding film are provided, and in addition, the light transmission regions are formed in the first color filter, where transmissive display is performed, light transmitted through the second color filter is transmitted through the light-transmission regions of the first color filter without being affected, and is then emitted from the transparent substrate side, and hence, colors complementary to those of a reflective display are not displayed in the corresponding pixels, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The display electrodes used in the present invention are provided for one substrate of a pair of substrates, or for both substrates, in accordance with a drive system. For example, where a passive matrix drive is used, electrodes in a stripe pattern are provided for both substrates so as to intersect and face each other. Where a TFD (Thin Film Diode) active matrix drive is used, pixel electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern are provided for one substrate, and electrodes in a stripe pattern are provided for the other substrate so as to be opposed to each other. Where a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) active matrix drive is used, pixel electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern are provided for one substrate, and a counter electrode is provided on the entire surface of the other substrate so as to be opposed to each other. In addition, where a TFT active matrix drive has a lateral electric field drive system, pixel electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern in a matrix are provided for one substrate of the pair of substrate. In addition, there may be various methods to dispose a polarizer in accordance with arrangement of an electro-optical material, such as liquid crystal, and in addition, a retardation film for color correction may also be disposed on a polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the structure according to the present invention described above, the other substrate opposed to the transparent substrate may be a transparent substrate. However, where the structure in which the first color filter, the light-shielding film, the second color filter, and the light-source are provided for the other substrate at the electro-optical material side is used, it is not always necessary that the other substrate be a transparent substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As a result, according to the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, by using the selective-reflection type first color filter, the optical efficiency therein is high in a bright place, and hence, a bright, color reflective display can be created. In a dark place, regardless of the presence of the first color filter, by the second color filter, a color transmissive display can be created in each pixel as with the case in which a color reflective display is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to one mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the first color filter includes a selective-reflection layer provided in the selective-reflection region in each pixel, and the selective-reflection layer is not provided in a part of the light transmission region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to this mode, in the selective-reflection regions of the first color filter, external light is reflected off of the selective-reflection layer formed of, for example, known cholesteric liquid crystal, a hologram, a dychroic mirror, or the like, and hence, a bright, color reflective display can be created. In contrast, since the selective-reflection layer described above is not provided in a part of the light-transmission region, light-source light passes therethrough without being affected, and hence, a bright, transmissive display, which does not exhibit colors complementary to those of a reflective display, can be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this mode, the selective-reflection layer may be provided with an opening or a slit at a position corresponding to the light-transmission region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Where the structure is formed as described above, by regularly or irregularly forming one or more than one openings or slits in each pixel, the light-transmission region can be reliably and relatively easily formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the mode described above, neighboring selective-reflection layers may form spacings therebetween so that the spacings are used as the light-transmission regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Where the structure is formed as described above, by forming selective-reflection layers each having the periphery slightly smaller than the periphery of an opening region (a region where light to be used for a display is reflected or transmitted) of the pixel, the spacings between the selective-reflection layers can be reliably and relatively easily formed as the light-transmission regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the display electrodes include first transparent electrodes in a stripe pattern provided on the first color filter at the electro-optical material side; and second transparent electrodes in a stripe pattern which are provided to be opposed to the first transparent electrodes, with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween, and to intersect the first transparent electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to this mode described above, on the first color filter at the electro-optical material side, the first transparent electrodes in a stripe pattern formed of, for example, an ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) film, are formed. In contrast, the second transparent electrodes in a stripe pattern formed of, for example, an ITO film, are provided so as to be opposed to the first transparent electrodes with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween. That is, in the case described above, the first transparent electrodes are provided for the substrate provided with the light-source, and the second transparent electrodes are provided for the transparent substrate on which external light is incident. Accordingly, a transflective electro-optical device having a passive matrix drive system can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, in accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the display electrodes include first transparent electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern which are provided on the first color filter at the electro-optical material side, and which are each provided in each pixel; and a second transparent electrode provided to be opposed to the first transparent electrodes with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, on the first color filter at the electro-optical material side, the first transparent electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern formed of, for example, an ITO film, that is, the pixel electrodes, are formed. In contrast, the transparent electrode formed of, for example, an ITO film, that is, the counter electrode formed over the entire surface of the substrate or counter electrodes in a stripe pattern, is provided so as to be opposed to the first transparent electrodes with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween. That is, in the case described above, the pixel electrodes are provided for the substrate provided with the light source, and the counter electrode is provided for the transparent substrate on which external light is incident. Accordingly, an active matrix drive system can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the display electrodes include first transparent electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern which are provided to be opposed to the first color filter with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween, and which are each provided in each pixel; and a second transparent electrode provided to be opposed to the first transparent electrodes with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, the first transparent electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern formed of, for example, an ITO film, that is, the pixel electrodes, are provided so as to be opposed to the first color filter with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween. In contrast, the transparent electrode formed of, for example, an ITO film, that is, the counter electrode formed over the entire surface of the substrate or counter electrodes in a stripe pattern, is provided so as to be opposed to the first transparent electrodes with the electro-optical material interposed therebetween. That is, in the case described above, the pixel electrodes are provided for the transparent substrate on which external light is incident, and the counter electrode is provided for the substrate provided with the light-source. Accordingly, an active matrix drive system can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the mode in which the display electrodes include the first transparent electrodes forming an island-shaped pattern, a switching element which is connected to the first transparent electrode may be further provided in each pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the structure described above, by performing switching drive of the first transparent electrodes, that is, the pixel electrodes, using switching elements, such as a TFT or a TFD, an active matrix drive can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the second color filter is provided on the one substrate of the pair of substrates at the electro-optical material side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, by the second color filter and the first color filter provided in that order on said one of the pair of substrates at the electro-optical material side, transmissive display and reflective display can both be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the second color filter is provided at the opposite side of the one substrate of the pair of substrates from the electro-optical material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, by the second color filter provided at the opposite side of the one substrate of the pair of substrates from the electro-optical material and the first color filter provided for the one substrate of the pair of substrates at the electro-optical material side, transmissive display and reflective display can both be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the light-source is provided at the opposite side of the second color filter from the electro-optical material, and includes a light guide plate provided so as to be opposed to the second color filter and a light source which emits light into the light guide plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, where transmissive display is performed in a dark place, light-source light emitted from the light source is guided to the second filter by the light guide plate. The light-source light thus guided is selectively transmitted through the second color filter, is further transmitted through the light-transmission regions of the first color filter without being affected, and is the emitted from the transparent substrate via the electro-optical material. Accordingly, a bright, transmissive display, which does not exhibit colors complementary to those of a reflective display, can be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In addition, in accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the light-source is provided at the opposite side of the second color filter from the electro-optical material, and includes a plurality of point light sources provided so as to be opposed to the associated light transmission regions with the second color filter interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, where transmissive display is performed in a dark place, light-source light is emitted from the light source to the light-transmission regions of the first color filter. The light-source light is selectively transmitted through the second color filter, is further transmitted through the light-transmission regions of the first color filter without being affected, and is then emitted from the transparent substrate via the electro-optical material. Accordingly, since there is substantially no light-source light that is blocked by the light-shielding film, the energy efficiency in the light source is high, and a bright transmissive display can be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the transflective electro-optical device further includes a plurality of microlenses provided at the opposite side of the first color filter from the electro-optical material so as to be opposed to the associated light transmission regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, where transmissive display is performed in a dark place, light-source light emitted from the light source is transmitted through the second color filter and, almost at the same time, is condensed on the light-transmission regions of the first color filter by the microlenses. The light-source light is transmitted through the light-transmission regions of the first color filter without being affected and is then emitted from the transparent substrate via the electro-optical material. Accordingly, since there is only a small amount of light that is blocked by the light-shielding film, the energy efficiency in the light source is high, and a bright transmissive display can be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another mode of the transflective electro-optical device of the present invention, the light-shielding film is provided between the first color filter and the second color filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to the mode described above, by the light-shielding film provided between the first color filter and the second color filter, where transmissive display is performed, light-source light is prevented from being selectively transmitted through the selective-reflection regions of the first color filter, that is, the generation of light-source light which creates a color display complementary to a reflective display can be prevented.

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is placed in a predetermined orientation state by the alignment layers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when an electric field is not applied between the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed of one type of nematic liquid crystals or an STN (Super Twisted Nematic) liquid crystal that is a mixture of several types of nematic liquid crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The sealing material <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is an adhesive formed of, for example, a photocurable resin or a thermosetting resin. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In particular, in this embodiment, a selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> that has a slit or an opening having a predetermined shape provided in each pixel and that selectively reflects light in a predetermined wavelength range, and a selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> that selectively transmits light in a predetermined wavelength range are formed under the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that are provided above the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, between the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a light-shielding film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> provided with slits therein is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> According to an enlarged view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, which is an example of the first color filter, includes in each pixel a selective-reflection layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R that reflects R light and transmits G light and B light; a selective-reflection layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G that reflects G light and transmits R light and B light; and a selective-reflection layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B that reflects B light and transmits R light and G light. These selective-reflection layers <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B are formed of known cholesteric liquid crystal, holograms, dychroic mirrors, or the like. In addition, the selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, which is an example of a second color filter, includes in each pixel a selective-transmission layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>R that transmits R light and absorbs G light and B light; a selective-transmission layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>G that transmits G light and absorbs R light and B light; and a selective-transmission layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>B that transmits B light and absorbs R light and G light. These selective-transmission layers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>B are formed of known resin materials that are colored by dyes or pigments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The selective-reflection layers <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B are provided with slits <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>or opening portions having a predetermined shape. These slits <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>are also continuously formed in the light-shielding film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. In addition, these selective-transmission layers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>B are provided at areas opposed to the slits <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, and the other part of the selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is formed of a planarization film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>f. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Next, various particular examples of slits <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>or opening portions provided in the selective-reflection layers <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), four rectangular slits may be provided at four comers in each pixel; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), five rectangular slits may be provided side by side in the lateral direction in each pixel; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a number of circular openings (for example, openings 2 mm in diameter) may be dispersedly provided in each pixel; and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), one relatively large rectangular slit may be provided in each pixel. These opening portions may be easily formed by a photolithographic step using a resist, a development step, and a stripping step. In addition to the plan shapes of the opening portions shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), a square shape, a polygonal shape, an oval shape, or an irregular shape may also be used, and a slit extending through a plurality of pixels may also be used. In addition, when the selective-reflection layers <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B are patterned, the opening portions may be simultaneously formed, and in the case described above, the number of manufacturing steps is not necessary to increase. In particular, where the slits are as those shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), or (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the width of the slit is preferably set to approximately 3 to 20 mm. When the slits are formed as described above, in both cases in which reflective display and transmissive display are performed, a bright and high contrast display can be created. Instead of forming the slits or the opening portions described above, for example, the selective-reflection layers <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B may be separated from each other as viewed in plan from the direction perpendicular to the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that light is allowed to pass through spacings formed by the neighboring selective-reflection layers <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The selective-transmission layers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>B for individual RGB, which form the selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, are arranged in a delta pattern, a stripe pattern, a mosaic pattern, a triangle pattern, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Even though not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, for example, a light-shielding film that is formed of the same material as that of the light-shielding film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> or is formed of a material different therefrom may be provided parallel to the inside of the sealing material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so as to be used as a frame to define the periphery of an image display area. Alternatively, this type of frame described above may be defined by the edges of a shading case in which a transflective liquid crystal device is received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Next, operation of the transflective liquid crystal device of the first embodiment having the structure as described above will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For example, the transflective liquid crystal device of the first embodiment is a normally black mode driven by a passive matrix drive system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Reflective display will first be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the case mentioned above, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, where external light L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) enters from the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> side (that is, the upper side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), after passing through the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the transparent second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the incident light is reflected from the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> provided above the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and again after passing through the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the light is then emitted from the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> side as reflection light L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which is colored by a predetermined color. In the steps described above, where image signals and scanning signals are supplied to the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at predetermined timing from an external circuit, electric fields are sequentially applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in each row, each column, or each pixel at which the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> intersect each other. Accordingly, by controlling the orientation state of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in each pixel using this voltage application, the amount of light passing through the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is modulated, and hence, gray scale color display can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, transmissive display will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the case mentioned above, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, where light-source light L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) enters from the lower side of the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the polarizer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the incident light is transmitted through the selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the slits <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, and after passing through the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the incident light is then emitted from the polarizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> side as transmission light L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is colored by a predetermined color. In the steps described above, when image signals and scanning signals are supplied to the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at predetermined timing from an external circuit, electric fields are sequentially applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in each row, each column, or each pixel at which the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> intersect each other. Accordingly, by controlling the orientation state of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in each pixel using this voltage application, the light-source light is modulated, and hence, gray scale display can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As a result, according to the first embodiment, where the transmissive display is performed, a color complementary to that of the reflective display is not displayed in each pixel, and where the device structure is formed so that color display having normal color tones can be performed by the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in the case of the reflective display, color display having normal color tones can also be performed by the selective-transmission color filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in the case of the transmissive display. In addition, where reflective display is performed using external light having limited light intensity, since the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is used instead of a conventional selective-transmission color filter, bright reflective display can be performed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, compared to the case of the first embodiment, the transflective electro-optical device of the fifth embodiment preferably has strip-shaped transparent data lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> instead of the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a stripe pattern. In addition, on the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, instead of transparent electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a stripe pattern, transparent pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and TFD drive element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> adjacent thereto are provided.

Accordingly, the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> other than the slits reflects external light so that the external light is emitted from the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> side, and hence, reflective display by the TFD active matrix drive can be performed. In addition, where the fluorescent tube <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is turned on, the light-source light is emitted from the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> side via the selective-transmission filter <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the slits of the selective-reflection color filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and hence, transmission display by the TFD active matrix drive can be performed. In particular, since a voltage is applied to each pixel electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>via the TFD drive element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, crosstalk between the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be reduced, and as a result, higher-quality image display can be performed. </paragraph>
