<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to internal combustion engines and more specifically an internal combustion engine used to power an aircraft. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As is known in the art, a considerable amount of attention has been given to the elimination of engine knock, or spark knock, that is produced during the combustion process in an internal combustion engine. Spark knock refers to the sound and related effects produced in spark ignited internal combustion engines by instantaneous ignition and combustion, i.e., autoignition, of the gaseous fuel-air mixture ahead of the advancing flame front. After spark ignition, the flame front travels outward from the spark plug and, under normal combustion, will progressively burn the entire fuel-air charge. The burned gas liberates heat and expands, leading to increased pressure and temperature in the unburned gas ahead of the flame front. In addition, the cylinder pressure and temperature increase due to the upward, compressive motion of the piston. The result is that the unburned fuel may be raised above its autoignition temperature. However, before autoignition occurs, time must be allowed for the chemical reactions that precede knock. If the flame front passes through the unburned gas before these reactions are completed, normal combustion results. If these reactions occur too quickly or if the flame front velocity is too small, the unburned gas spontaneously ignites and burns instantaneously. This process is also referred to as detonation. The instantaneous combustion results in a very intense pressure wave that is internally reflected within the cylinder at a characteristic frequency related to the velocity of sound within the cylinder and the dimensions of the combustion chamber. The flexing of the cylinder wall and cylinder head produces the audible, high-frequency pinging sound known as spark knock. Besides sound, spark knock leads to structural damage of the combustion chamber and engine and loss of efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A popular way to reduce knock in an automobile internal combustion engine is by increasing the octane rating of the gasoline, where the octane rating is a measure of the fuel&apos;s resistance to knock. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to knocking. Higher octane numbers are due to higher autoignition temperatures or longer end-gas chemical reaction times. Either fuel structure or fuel additives determine octane rating. More compact hydrocarbon molecules have higher octane numbers than do long-chain molecules. For many years, the most popular anti-knock additive was lead. However, because of the elimination of leaded gas for automobile use in the U.S. and because other anti-knock additives are not as effective as lead, manufactures of automobile engines turned to improved combustion chamber design to prevent knock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As is known in the automotive industry, combustion chamber designs that increase temperature, pressure, and chemical residence time of the unburned gas (end gas) increase spark knock. Increased compression ratio, off-center plug location, and slow-burn combustion chambers also lead to increased spark knock. Conversely, a faster-burning chamber, due to higher in-cylinder gas velocity and turbulence, and central plug location increase knock resistance. Faster-burning chambers are helpful in eliminating knock because the last part of the charge is burned by the flame front before it has time to spontaneously ignite, i.e., detonate. Characteristics of faster-burning chambers include the use of high swirl intake ports and a rotational motion (swirl) of the charge due to off-cylinder axis charge admission); the use of two or more spark plugs; and inducement of small-scale turbulence in the cylinder charge achieved by designing the chamber so that part of the piston head comes close to the cylinder head at top dead c enter to thereby &ldquo;squish&rdquo; the charge in this region into the rest of the combustion chamber and toward the spark plug tips. Another way to produce a faster-burning chamber to reduce knock is by fuel enrichment, i.e., increasing the air-fuel mixture ratio. This also helps to cool the engine. However, the penalty associated with fuel enrichment is reduced fuel economy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, the advancements in combustion cylinder design directed at reducing, spark knock described above have not occurred in piston-cylinder engines used in aircraft. One reason for this is that the Federal government has not yet phased out the use of lead as an additive for aviation gasoline. Thus, the use of high octane, leaded gasoline has been the primary method to reduce knock in piston-cylinder aircraft engines. However, because of continuing environmental concerns, the future availability of high octane aviation gasoline is in doubt. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need to provide an internal combustion chamber design for an aircraft engine that significantly reduces knock without the need to burn leaded aviation gasoline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved, internal combustion aircraft engine. The internal combustion aircraft engine comprising a cylinder head having a cylindrical head bore formed therein, a piston, and spark plugs. The cylinder head is fixedly attached to a top end of a cylinder barrel formed with cylindrical walls, the cylinder head bore and the cylindrical walls defining a cylinder. The cylinder head bore has formed therein an outwardly protruding cavity with respect to the top end of the cylinder barrel. The piston has a piston crown, and the piston contained within the cylinder, the piston crown, the cylinder walls, and the cylinder head bore define a combustion chamber. The piston crown has a concavity formed therein, and the piston construction arranged to reciprocate within the cylinder. The concavity of the piston crown and the cavity cooperate at a top dead center position of the piston to form a swirl chamber. The piston crown has formed along a peripheral edge thereof a squish area that corresponds to a second squish area formed in the cylinder head bore, so that when the piston approaches top dead center, the squish area and the second squish area cooperate to cause combustion gases to move radically inward of the combustion chamber and into the swirl chamber. Spark plugs extend through the cylinder head, the tips of which are disposed within the swirl chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other features and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation of the invention and the function and interrelation of the elements of structure will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this disclosure, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While the present invention will hereinafter be described in connection with at least one exemplary embodiment thereof, it should be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to that embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now more particularly to the Figures, an aircraft engine cylinder assembly, generally indicated as <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is illustrated according to the principles of the present invention. It will be appreciated to those skilled in the art that the cylinder assembly described and shown herein is a representation of a single cylinder assembly in a multi-cylinder, internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine may also be a single cylinder engine. Additionally, the engine may be a four-stroke or a two-stroke engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, aircraft cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises, among other components, a cylinder barrel, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a cylinder head, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, connected to one end thereof, and a piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Generally, cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which includes a piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, cooperate during operation of the engine to focus the fuel charge (air/fuel mixture) into a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is defined by the special configuration of cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the form of an annular wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a bore <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which extends therethrough. The bore <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a diameter &ldquo;D.&rdquo; Cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is machined to include a plurality of annular fins <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extending from the outer periphery thereof to transfer heat from the cylinder to the ambient air, as generally known in tie art. Disposed adjacent to annular wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a radially extending flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> therein, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The openings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are configured to receive fasteners (not shown) therethrough so as to mount cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the rest of an aircraft engine (not shown). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made from a thermally-conductive material, such as, for example, steel. However, any suitable material known in the art may be substituted therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further includes a cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a portion of which has threads <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed thereon to receive corresponding threads formed on an outside portion of cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, attachment of the cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is accomplished by screwing cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> onto cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be fixedly attached to each other by being bolted together in a conventional manner at mating surfaces. Mating bores <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively, define one complete cylinder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is machined or cast into a generally hollow configuration having a plurality of annular fins <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> extending from the outer periphery thereof for heat transfer, as generally known in the art. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made from a lightweight, thermally-conductive material, such as, for example, aluminum. However, any suitable material known in the art may be substituted therefor. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for delivering the air-fuel mixture to cylinder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and an exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by which burned exhaust gas exits therefrom. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown, intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a high swirl intake port. Intake and exhaust ports <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are opened and closed via intake and exhaust valves (not shown), respectively, which operate in a known manner and need not be described. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aircraft engine has two valves per cylinder, one intake valve and one exhaust valve for each intake and exhaust port, respectively. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the cylinder may include multiple intake and/or exhaust ports and corresponding valves. It is also contemplated that a camshaft (not shown) may be located in cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> directly over the intake and exhaust ports <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further comprises a specially shaped dome, generally indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which forms an upper combustion wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a continuous, generally bell-shaped configuration such that outwardly spaced convex wall portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> integrally flank a central concave portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on opposite sides thereof. That is, the outwardly spaced convex wall portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are sloped slightly upward and are generally of a convex shape from the perspective of piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). As each wall portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extends radially inward toward the center of the cylinder, an inflection point <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> occurs at a location approximately intermediate of spark plug opening ports <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Each wall portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> up to this inflection point <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is referred to as the squish area (&ldquo;S&rdquo;). From inflection point <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, wall portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> then transitions into a concave shape from the perspective of piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to form concave portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Thus, by way of the above, dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is generally bell-shaped and also corresponds with the shape of piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> together with crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> forms the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, where an air-fuel mixture is burned. The shape of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the squish region S represent an aspect of the present invention, which will be discussed in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, wall portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a convex shape as viewed from the perspective of the piston. However, wall portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which defines squish area &ldquo;S&rdquo;, can also have a slanted, linear shape extending from a fillet radius <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to inflection point <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Also, in an preferred embodiment of the present invention, wall portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is defined by bell-shaped dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, wall portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> could also be substantially flat, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, where a cup-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is provided rather than dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, formed in cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are a pair of spark plug receiving openings, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, disposed on opposite sides of the cylinder head. Spark plug receiving openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extend from the outer periphery of cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form spark plug ports <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), respectively. Openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> receive spark plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) therein so as to provide spark ignition to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The orientation and location of spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and thus the orientation and location of the spark plugs within combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, represents a significant aspect of the present invention that will be discussed in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, spark plug receiving openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are configured and positioned such that when spark plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are disposed therein, the spark plug tips <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are in relatively close proximity to one another. Spark plug receiving openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> enter the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at angles &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>; and &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>respectively. Because spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are disposed in close proximity to one another, the distance between the spark plug tips <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, which is designated as &ldquo;d&rdquo;, within combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is reduced from that of conventional aircraft cylinder engines. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; between spark plug tips is approximately 3.15 inches, or 0.6 times the diameter (&ldquo;D&rdquo;) of the bore <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; may also be within a range of 2.58 to 3.62 inches, or 0.5 to 0.7 times D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Additionally, spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are oriented such that they are not parallel with the viewing plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Rather, spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are angled, or tilted, inward away from a centerline at angles of &thgr;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>, respectively, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. That is, the spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are tilted by angles &thgr;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>respectively, toward exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Tilting the spark plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> toward the exhaust port places spark plug tips <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> closer to exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the exhaust port gases. Since the exhaust port side is hotter than the intake port side, placing the spark plug tips <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> closer to the exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> enhances combustion and increases flame speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A top view of the present embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, and the typical prior art arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are tilted toward the exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Also spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are moved closer to each other, both being moved radially inward of the cylinder, as compared with the prior art cylinder. As a result, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distance from the center of the spark plug ports <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to cylinder wall <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at the exhaust port side is approximately 20% shorter than the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the disclosed embodiment of the present invention, angle &thgr;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>is approximately 19.4&deg;. However, angle &thgr;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>may be within a range of 15&deg; to 25&deg;. Similarly, in the disclosed embodiment of the invention, angle &thgr;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>is approximately 9.9&deg;. However, angle &thgr;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>may be within a range of 5&deg; to 15&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Also, the present embodiment of the invention, angle &Oslash;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>is approximately 30&deg;. However, angle &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>may be within a range of 25&deg; to 35&deg;. Similarly, in the present embodiment of the present invention, angle &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>is approximately 300. However, angle &Oslash;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>may be within a range of 25&deg; to 35&deg;. The angles &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>and &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>are not intended to be limiting. Rather, any angle or configuration is contemplated which positions the tips <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the spark plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> closer to the exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although in the illustrated embodiment spark plug openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are tilted toward the exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may also be tilted toward intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Or, spark plug opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be titled toward intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and spark plug opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be tilted toward exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the numerous surfaces and holes machined, drilled and tapped into both cylinder barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, where various components can be mounted thereto, as well as other details of the illustrated cylinder assembly and the rest of the engine are purely conventional and require no additional explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> formed thereon, the piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a concave portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, which generally defines the lower wall of combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is defined at top dead center by dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and concave portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is integral with the hollow, cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the piston. Piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is configured to correspond with dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to cooperatively focus the combustion gases from the outwardly spaced convex portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (the squish area S) radially inward toward combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The squish area on the piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that corresponds to squish area S on cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a rounded edge <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which is referred to as squish area P. Squish area P integrally extends from annular wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to circumferentially extend around the piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in generally surrounding relation to concave portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Concave portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises three depressed regions, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, corresponding to locations beneath exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and spark plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Depressed region <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a spherical shape and extends transversely across the piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the boundary of which is entirely contained within the area enclosed by squish area P. Regions <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> constitute a pair of generally arcuate valve receiving, spherically-shaped, depressed regions disposed generally beneath the intake and exhaust port locations, and each having a hemispherical beveled wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, respectively, that integrally extends inwardly from the rounded edge <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (squish area P). Depressed region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, is diametrically larger than depressed region <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention shown, centrally located within each of depressed regions <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are circular depressions <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, disposed substantially beneath exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> locations. The diameters of circular depressions <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> generally correspond to the intake and exhaust valve diameters (not shown). Circular depressions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, however, need not be incorporated into the embodiment shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The shape of piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the shape of the cylinder head, and the piston crown&apos;s proximity to the cylinder head at the squish area S cooperate to squeeze the fuel charge radially inwardly into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This squeezing action generates turbulence within chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that facilitates rapid burning of the fuel charge. In the squish area, the rounded edge portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is of the same shape as the corresponding cylinder head wall portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The distance, or clearance, between the rounded edge portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and cylinder head wall portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at top dead center is referred to as the squish band thickness &ldquo;c&rdquo; (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the squish band thickness c is approximately 0.047 &plus;/&minus;0.0 16 inches at top dead center (&ldquo;TDC&rdquo;). Top dead center is the position where the piston has reached the top of its movement within cylinder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the centerline of piston rod <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is substantially parallel to the bore of the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> further includes a pair of shallow recesses <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> disposed in diametrically opposing sides of the opposite end of annular wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Disposed on the exterior of annular wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are a pair of aligned rod receiving holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> extending through the diametrically opposing sides which include the recesses <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> therein. Rod receiving holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are interposed between a pair of D-shaped cavities <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to pivotally mount piston head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to piston rod <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as generally known in the art. A series of parallel grooves <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are disposed in closely spaced relation with respect to one another, the lowermost of which has oil hole <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for dispersing lubricating oil therethrough. Grooves <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are configured to receive rings (not shown), as generally known in the art, to prevent the lubricating oil from entering the combustion side of the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The above combination that includes spark plugs tips in close proximity to each other, piston crown <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> designed to squish the fuel charge radially inward, and centrally located combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, provides for a significantly improved combustion process that substantially reduces or eliminates knock without the need to use high octane fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring to the operation of an engine fitted with a cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, after a fuel charge (i.e., fuel/air mixture) enters high swirl intake port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves toward TDC and compresses the fuel charge as the combustion side of cylinder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> decreases in volume. As the piston <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rapidly moves toward cylinder head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and reaches TDC, the tight squish band thickness c and squish area S forces the fuel charge radially inward at a high velocity, creating high turbulence and concentrating the fuel charge within combustion chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At this, point, or just before TDC, each one of spark plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> generates a spark and ignites the fuel charge. Each plug tip <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> creates a flame front, burning fuel that it passes through. The flame front causes the temperature in the cylinder, and thus the pressure to rise. Additionally, in an embodiment where the spark plug ignites the fuel charge before the piston reaches TDC, the fuel charge is further compressed by the piston motion toward the cylinder head. In either case, the pressure rise in the cylinder at this point is very rapid, but it generally proceeds at a fairly even controlled rate. Because the fuel charge is concentrated within chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with high turbulence and spark plug lips <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are in close proximity, the time that it takes for the flame fronts to travel across the volume of fuel charge is reduced. Additionally, the high turbulence created by the squish area and the intake port assists the combustion process. As a result, the fuel charge is rapidly burned and the unburned fuel charge ahead of the flame front does not have time to autoignite. Because autoignition, and thus spark knock, are significantly reduced or eliminated by providing a cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the described embodiment of the present invention, fuel enrichment and/or high octane fuel is not required to significantly reduce, or eliminate, the occurrence of spark knock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments and elements, but, to the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications, combinations of features, equivalent arrangements, and equivalent elements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
