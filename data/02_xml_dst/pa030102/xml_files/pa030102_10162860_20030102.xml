<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an X-ray diagnostic apparatus of the type having a storage luminescent screen for the latent storage of the respective X-ray image, having an X-ray exposure apparatus for producing an X-ray beam, a readout apparatus system with which, for the reproduction of an image, the storage luminescent screen is excited to luminescence by a scanning with a source of radiation, a detector for the acquisition of the light emitted by the storage luminescent screen, and an image reproduction system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> German OS 38 03 766, discloses an X-ray diagnostic apparatus of this type in which, as a radiation-sensitive converter, a storage luminophore is irradiated with X-rays so that unbonded electrons are produced therein that are stored in potential traps. With a readout system, the entire surface of this storage luminescent screen is scanned pixel-by-pixel by an additional source of radiation, for example a laser, so that the electrons stored in the traps are excited and can fall back into recombination centers, whereby the energy differential is radiated in the form of light quanta. In this way, it is possible to read out the stored X-ray image from the storage luminescent screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For the planiform scanning of the storage luminescent screen, a laser beam of the type known as a flying spot scanner is deflected by two mirrors in the vertical and horizontal directions, so that all pixels located on the storage luminescent screen can be scanned one after the other. The light emitted by the storage luminescent screen is acquired by two light-guiding plates, and is guided to two laterally attached line-shaped CCD light converters. The output signal of the detector is supplied to a conventional video chain for the reproduction of the X-ray image on a monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this context, barium fluoride-bromium chloride compounds activated with europium that are known from German OS 33 47 207 and that can be excited by visible light (photostimulation), can be used as storage luminophores. A He-Ne laser, is usually employed which produces radiation having a wavelength of 633 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> From European Application 859 244, an X-ray diagnostic apparatus is known in which the plates of the storage luminescent screens are read out with CCD lines instead of a flying spot scanner. These lines are very sensitive to the exact maintenance and reproducibility of the distance between the layer to be read out and the line-shaped CCD detector. The larger the numerical aperture of the light collector (for example a fiber-optic plate), the more strongly distance variations are noticeable, as causing a worsening of the modulation transmission function (MTF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In flying spot scanners, the storage luminophore film or foil can be held without difficulty on a flat base by vacuum suction, because the stimulation and reading out are carried out from the same side. In the case of a CCD line readout arrangement, this is generally not possible, due to the limitations imposed by the aperture. If a correspondingly large glass plate were supported only at the edges (which would allow readout and stimulation), the gravitational deformation would be approximately 50 &mgr;m, however, a deflection of this sort leads to an undesirable reduction of the MTF. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an X-ray diagnostic of the type described above that avoids, or at least significantly reduces, bendings &lsqb;or deflections of the plate of the storage luminescent screen, without damaging the imaging layer containing the storage luminophore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The object is inventively achieved in an X-ray diagnostic apparatus wherein, for scanning the storage luminophore, the screen is guided through access or an opening of a supporting structure having a rectangular cross-section, and is held in the scanning region by air bearings attached to the supporting structure on both sides of the opening, and wherein a line-shaped radiation source for stimulation radiation and a line-shaped light detector are mounted at the supporting structure. Due to the use of air bearings having small distance tolerances, no friction arises that could hinder the scanning process and damage the layer surface, so that the storage luminescent screen can be accurately held in the scanning region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the invention, the line-shaped radiation source can be attached to the supporting structure on the one side of the opening, and the line-shaped detector can be attached to the supporting structure on the other side of the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It has proven advantageous for two air bearings to be provided on each of the sides at which the line-shaped radiation source and the line-shaped detector are respectively disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The line-shaped source of radiation can be a photodiode array, and the line-shaped detector can be a CCD light converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to accommodate the weight of the storage luminescent screen with minimal shape deformation, the supporting structure can be realized as a frame that is resistant to bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The air bearings can inventively operate at 5.5 bar excess (i.e., above atmospheric) pressure, with gap widths of 6&plusmn;1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Deflection of the storage luminescent screen is optimally prevented in an embodiment wherein the air bearings are arranged such that they have a distance from the edge of the storage luminescent screen that corresponds to one-fourth of the width of the storage luminescent screen, or so that they divide the width of the scanning region into three regions of equal size.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an X-ray diagnostic apparatus having an X-ray tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supplied by a voltage generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with high voltage and heating voltage for a thermionic cathode, the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> producing a cone-shaped X-ray beam <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that penetrates a patient <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The X-rays, attenuated by the patient <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> corresponding to the patient&apos;s transparency, strike a storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As already described, this incident radiation image produces unbonded electrons in the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that are stored in potential traps of the storage luminophore, so that a latent image is stored in the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For the reproduction (readout) of the latent stored image, the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is excited line-by-line by a scanner <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires the light emitted by the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and converts the light corresponding to the brightness of the scanned pixels into an electrical signal that is supplied to a playback circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which produces, from the individual analog output signals of the detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a video signal for representation on a monitor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The playback circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can include a video chain having converters, image storage means (memories), and processing circuits. Operating elements <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are connected with the remaining components of the X-ray diagnostic apparatus via a system control and communication unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The system control and communication unit controls and synchronizes the voltage generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the relative motion of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the scanner <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the playback circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the monitor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top view of the inventive scanner <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for the plate-shaped storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which for example has a carrier plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of glass. A support structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a rectangular cross-section and having an opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that is visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, encompasses the carrier plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. On the side located underneath the carrier plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a photodiode array <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached as a line-shaped source of stimulation radiation, and above the carrier plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a CCD light converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the support structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a line-shaped light detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Two air bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are attached to the support structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at each side, laterally to the line-shaped photodiode array <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and laterally to the line-shaped CCD light converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The air bearings are arranged such that they have a distance from the edge of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that corresponds approximately to one-fourth of the width of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this way, the four air bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> arranged on the side of the support structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be disposed to define a rectangle whose length corresponds to half the width of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and whose width corresponds, for example, to twice the width of the line-shaped photodiode array <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, or twice the width of the line-shaped CCD light converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the air bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be arranged such that they divide the width of the scanning region into three regions of equal size. More than eight air bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since, during the CCD line readout, stimulation takes place by means of transmitted light, a head is guided over the entire width of the imaging plate of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on both sides of the transparent carrier plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is, for example, made of glass. The line-shaped stimulation light source and the photodiode array <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are guided on the underside of the glass carrier plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the CCD line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is guided on the upper side. The CCD and light source support structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fashioned as a frame that is resistant to bending, in order to enable the weight of the glass carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be held with minimal shape deformation. Transmission of force takes place via the air bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> arranged on both sides. These operate, for example, at 5.5 bar excess pressure, with gap widths of 6&plusmn;1 &mgr;m. The distance tolerances are thereby very small, and no friction arises that could hinder the scanning process and damage the layer surface. Moreover, the trueness of the shape of the layer carrier, and thus the resolution of the detector, are maximally independent of position. This is a property that is of the greatest importance for applications in medical X-ray technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Instead of the above-described scanning with transmitted light, the air bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be used in an arrangement in which stimulation and reading out of the storage luminescent screen <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> take place from the same side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although modifications and changes may be suggested by those skilled in the art, it is the intention of the inventors to embody within the patent warranted hereon all changes and modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of their contribution to the art. </paragraph>
