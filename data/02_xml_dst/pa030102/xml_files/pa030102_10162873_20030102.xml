<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a deposition apparatus of a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a chemical enhancer (CE) treatment chamber and a Cu thin film deposition apparatus of a semiconductor device using the same, in which throughput improves and reduces contamination of the chamber when catalysis treatment and CVD Cu deposition are carried out in one chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the enhanced performance of semiconductor memory devices, increase in speed and reliability of a semiconductor device is becoming a major concern. Especially, the current Cu lining, which is used to increase speed and reliability of the semiconductor devices, uses electroplating as a deposition method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the electroplating method requires a thin film deposition process of a clean and safe Cu seed layer, and so the electroplating method depends highly on the seed layer and may face its limitations in a Tech level of 0.1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, due to a rapid enhancement of semiconductor devices, it is advantageous to use a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process in Cu line structures of advanced generation semiconductor devices, whereby a decrease in contact size and rapid increase in aspect ratio are expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the related art of Cu film deposition equipment has the following disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the case where the Cu thin film is deposited by the MOCVD process, a problem arises in that is not commercially used due to its low deposition speed. Additionally, further problems arise in that adhesion and texture quality are not good, thereby resulting in a major disadvantage in cost when compared to the electroplating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a metallic thin film is deposited by the MOCVD process, chemical additives such as catalysts can be added to increase deposition speed and enhance basic characteristics of the metallic thin film. However, a problem arises in that no CVD equipment cluster is provided, in which in-situ process carried out after barrier deposition and a catalyst enabling plasma treatment is used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In case, a supply line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is additionally formed between the first showerhead <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the second showerhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to send equalized CE to the second showerhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The additional supplying line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of through holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of 0.1 to 3 in diameter formed on a metallic substrate. The through holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in quadratic shapes and at regular intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The CE is a substance containing I, such as CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>I, or C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>I, or elements of the <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>group of the Periodic Table of elements, such as F, Cl, I, or Br. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned CE treatment chamber according to the present invention now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> First, when the wafer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is inserted into the CE treatment chamber of the present invention, the heating device <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> moves so that the wafer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> reaches an edge beta sealing device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, thereby beginning the CE treatment process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In other words, the CE, which is sent through either a liquid vaporizer of a liquid delivery system (LDS) or a bubbler, is supplied to the wafer, sealed in the edge beta sealing device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, by passing through the CE supplying line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the first showerhead <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The CE is then primarily equalized at the showerhead and then passes through through holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the supplying line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to reach the second showerhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> where it is secondarily equalized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Afterwards, the CE equalized, in the second showerhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is set through a nozzle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, having a plurality of holes formed at a constant interval, in order to be equally injected onto the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The edge beta sealing device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> blocks the injected CE, which the flows out through the nozzle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The edge beta sealing device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls the CE so as not to learn toward the edge of the wafer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing CE from being absorbed on unnecessary portions of the wafer. Accordingly, in a later process, excessive Cu deposition or contamination can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the CE treatment is completed, vaporized gas such as He, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or Ar, which is supplied by the gas supplying line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, purifies the first showerhead <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the second showerhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the wafer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the edge beta sealing device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Also, any CE that is incompletely absorbed on the wafer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is removed and sent out through the nozzle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> illustrates a CE treatment chamber according to the present invention before CE treatment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates the CE treatment chamber according to the present invention during CE treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates Cu thin film deposition equipment of a semiconductor device using the CE treatment chamber of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the Cu thin film deposition equipment of the semiconductor device includes a load lock <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, an aligner <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a degas chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a pre-cleaning chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a barrier metal deposition chamber <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a CE treatment chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a CVD Cu deposition chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a plasma treatment chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and a feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In other words, a system for super-filling is needed, which includes a chamber for carrying out CE treatment and plasma treatment for equal Cu deposition during a CECVD Cu deposition process and another chamber removing, through plasma treatment, CE residue produced from the surface of a CECVD Cu thin film after the deposition of the CECVD Cu thin film. The corresponding structure of the equipment and its detailed wafer flow will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, Cu thin film deposition equipment of a semiconductor device includes a load lock <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for carrying out the steps before and after wafer (not shown) processes, an aligner <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for carrying out alignment so that the wafer reaches a desired position, a degas chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for removing residue such as gas produced on a surface of the wafer, a feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> provided with a robot for positioning the wafer in/out of each chamber, a pre-cleaning <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for cleaning the inside and the outside of a pattern using plasma on the wafer fed by the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, a barrier metal deposition chamber <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for depositing barrier metal on the pre-cleaned wafer by PVD, CVD, or ALD processes, a CE treatment chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for an equal CE treatment before depositing the Cu thin film on the barrier metal, a CVD Cu deposition chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for depositing the Cu thin film on the barrier metal, and a plasma treatment chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for carrying out plasma treatment for the uniform Cu thin film deposition after the CE treatment by the CE treatment chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and removing the residue such as CE produced on the surface of the Cu thin film after the deposition of the CVD Cu thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The operation of the Cu thin film deposition system of a semiconductor device using the CE treatment chamber according to the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> First, a wafer is introduced into a chamber through a load lock <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and an aligner <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> aligns the wafer to a desired position. Then, residue produced on the surface of the wafer is removed in a degas chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the wafer is introduced to a pre-cleaning chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. A pre-cleaning process is then carried out on an entire surface of the wafer by a dual frequency etch (DFE) process using Ar or He, or by a reactive cleaning process using a gas such as a halogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Then, the pre-cleaned wafer is fed into a barrier metal deposition chamber <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> through the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and barrier metal is deposited on the entire surface of the wafer using a PVD process, an ionized PVD process, a CVD process, or an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In this case, Ta, TaN, WNx, TiN, TiAlN, TaSiN, or TiSiN is used as the barrier metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Afterwards, the wafer containing the barrier metal is introduced to the plasma treatment chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to remove, through plasma treatment, residue produced on the surface of the barrier metal and, at the same time, to equalize the surface of the metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the wafer is fed to the CE treatment chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> through the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to equally adsorb CE on the entire surface of the wafer. Then, the wafer equally absorbed with CE is fed into the CVD Cu deposition chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> through the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to deposit the Cu thin film on the barrier metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In this situation, the CE treatment chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> consists of a chamber whereby CE treatment is carried out by using direct injection, spin coating, or a showerhead method. When a Cu thin film is deposited using the CVD Cu deposition chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the barrier metal is deposited and then plasma treatment is carried out using the plasma treatment chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In addition, by setting an AGL flash Cu deposition chamber, which deposits flash Cu as an AGL enhance adhesion of the CVD Cu thin film, deposited can be carried out at a thickness of 10 to 500 &angst;. The AGL flash Cu deposition chamber has a power of 1 to 500, in which deposition can be carried out by a long throw, PVD, or ionized PVD at a temperature ranging from 50 to 300&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the wafer deposited with the Cu thin film is sent through the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> into the plasma treatment chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Then, the CE used to deposit the Cu thin film and residue produced on the surface are removed by the plasma treatment, and the wafer is fed through the feeding chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and output to the load lock <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned CE treatment chamber and the Cu thin film deposition equipment for a semiconductor device using the same have the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The CE treatment can be carried out equally on the entire surface of the wafer; incompletely adsorbed CE can be removed, chamber contamination can be minimized; and diversion to the edge of the wafer can be controlled, thereby preventing excessive Cu deposition or contamination from occurring in a later process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition, with the plasma treatment, super-filling of the Cu thin film can be processed equally and CE produced on the surface of the Cu thin film can be effectively removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. Thus, the present invention can be readily applied to other types of systems. Thus, many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the present detailed description. </paragraph>
