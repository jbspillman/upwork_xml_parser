<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A lock-up clutch for a hydrodynamic torque converter has at least one friction area on a first converter component, which area can be brought into working connection with at least one opposing friction area on a second converter component by an engaging movement of this converter component or which can be separated from this opposing friction area by a disengaging movement in the direction opposite that of the engaging movement. On at least one of the two converter components, a pump device acting in either the friction area or in the opposing friction area is present, which, as a result of its geometric shape, has the effect of building up a pressure gradient, by means of which a forced flow of hydraulic fluid through at least one predetermined section of the friction area and/or of the opposing friction area is produced. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention pertains to a lock-up clutch with at least one friction area on a first converter component, which can be shifted into working connection with at least one opposing friction area on a second converter component by an engaging movement, or which can be separated from this opposing friction area by a disengaging movement in the direction opposite that of the engaging movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,173 discloses a lock-up clutch for a hydrodynamic torque converter with a piston, which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, carries a friction lining on the side facing a converter cover; the side of this lining which faces away from the piston serves as a friction area. The piston can be moved toward the converter cover to engage the lock-up clutch or away from it to disengage the clutch. As soon as the friction area of the friction lining makes contact with the converter cover, the corresponding contact surface of the latter serves as the opposing friction area. The piston serves as the first converter component, and the converter cover serves as the second converter component of the lock-up clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As soon as the friction lining of the piston comes into contact with the converter cover the rotational movement of the converter housing around its rotational axis is no longer transmitted to the transmission input shaft via a hydrodynamic circuit with an impeller, a turbine wheel, and a stator; instead, the movement is transmitted directly to the shaft by means of the lock-up clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The use of a lock-up clutch may be advantageous from the standpoint of energy efficiency, but in this operating state the lock-up clutch should be used to damp the torsional vibrations which may have been introduced along with the torque. For this reason, the piston of the lock-up clutch is connected by a torsional vibration damper to the transmission input shaft; the torsional vibration damper has stored-energy elements to absorb elastically the torsional vibrations. In designs of lock-up clutches without torsional vibration dampers, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> of the same Offenlegungsschrift, however, the pressure which presses the piston against the converter cover is reduced so that the piston can make a desirable slipping movement. Although this slippage may serve effectively to damp the introduced torsional vibrations, it allows in return a considerable amount of heat to build up in the friction area and in the opposing friction area. This principle of lock-up clutch operation with controlled slippage can be realized both with a so-called single-WK (single torque circuit) design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> and also with a double-WK design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, these two designs differing from each other only with respect to the number of friction linings. In the case of the double-WK design, however, the friction linings are preferably attached nonrotatably but with freedom of axial movement to a clutch disk located axially between the converter cover and the piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the number of friction linings and accordingly of the number of friction areas and opposing friction areas, the previously mentioned buildup of heat caused by slippage makes it necessary to take measures to ensure that this heat can be carried away as quickly as possible from the working area of the lock-up clutch. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,173, this is done by thermal conduction through the metal as a result of the temperature gradient which exists between the origination point of the heat and the other areas of the hydrodynamic torque converter through which hydraulic fluid is flowing. When large amounts of frictional work are performed, however, this type of cooling is no longer sufficient, which means that the friction linings will become overheated and that the hydraulic fluid passing over them will deteriorate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,363 discloses an elaboration in this regard. FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in particular show systems of grooves either in the friction linings or at least in one of the two converter components, i.e., in the converter cover or in the piston. These grooves make it possible for hydraulic fluid to flow from the radially outer area toward the radially inner area. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of this patent, the hydraulic fluid can be carried away through channels provided for the purpose to the rotational center of the hydrodynamic torque converter and thus conveyed out of the converter circuit. The disadvantage, however, is that the grooves offer relatively high resistance to the flow of the fluid; this can be caused, first, by comparatively small flow cross sections of the grooves and, second, by long travel distances in the grooves. A high pressure difference must therefore be built up so that a sufficiently high volume flow rate of hydraulic fluid through the grooves can be obtained in spite of the previously mentioned high flow resistance. As a result, lifting forces which try to lift the piston also develop axially between the converter cover and the piston, and to counteract them it is necessary to apply higher contact pressures. Precisely when high torques are being transmitted, therefore, a considerable amount of energy must be expended to maintain this cooling process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is also extremely difficult to lay out the flow cross sections and the lengths of these grooves in such a way that the precise pressure difference required to force the hydraulic fluid through them is obtained. An advantageous solution to this problem is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,732,804, according to which the length of the grooves is reduced and their cross sections are made relatively large. At least one throttle point is provided, which can be used to adjust the volume flow rate. This throttle point preferably passes through at least one of the friction linings in the axial direction. But even this solution with its advantageous engineering design still provides only a limited cooling action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Systems of grooves in the friction lining have also become known in which each individual groove has both its inflow and its outflow points on the same radial side of the friction lining, whereas the friction lining also has a friction area radially outside these grooves. This radially outer friction area is closed in the circumferential direction and is intended to prevent a possible pressure-induced leak-through of hydraulic fluid from the radially outer area inward toward the radially inner area. This design of a groove system, shown by way of example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,397, may indeed reduce any tendency of the piston to be lifted from the converter cover assigned to it when the pressure of the fluid flowing through the grooves builds up, but on the other hand it suffers from the disadvantage that the flow through each individual groove occurs exclusively by reason of shear forces in the hydraulic fluid, these shear forces being caused by the relative velocity between the limiting surfaces. The conveyed volume flow rate is therefore low, and, in addition, some of the hot hydraulic fluid forced out of the groove which precedes in the circumferential direction is taken up again by the groove which follows in the circumferential direction. The cooling effect which can be achieved is thus correspondingly low. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the task of designing the friction area of the lock-up clutch of a hydrodynamic torque converter in such a way that a highly effective cooling action can be obtained in the friction area while good energy efficiency is provided at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This task is accomplished according to the invention by providing a pump on at least one of the converter components, the pump acting in the friction area or in the opposing friction area, namely, a pump with a geometric design which allows it to generate a pressure gradient, it is possible to force the flow of hydraulic fluid through at least one predetermined section, of the friction area and/or of the opposing friction area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus the pump device can have a baffle element, for example, which projects into the flow path of the hydraulic fluid and causes turbulence to develop in at least certain parts of the fluid. As a result of this turbulence, the hydraulic fluid which has just flowed through the circumferentially preceding groove and thus become hot is mixed much more effectively with other hydraulic fluid which is present a greater distance away from the friction lining and is correspondingly cooler. Because of this intensive mixing, a hydraulic fluid is obtained which, by reason of its temperature, is able to carry away considerable amounts of heat from the circumferential following groove as the fluid flows through the grooves. In addition, because of the baffle element arranged in the flow path of the hydraulic fluid, it is ensured that a comparatively high volume flow rate is directed into the groove, so that, in the inflow area of the groove, a considerable dynamic pressure is built up, as a result of which the volume flow rate through the groove is significantly increased. This effect can be increased even more by providing the inflow to the groove with a cross section larger than that of the rest of the groove, so that the volume flow rate of the newly arriving, cooler hydraulic fluid quickly forces the heated hydraulic liquid already in the groove out of the groove. If this inflow to the groove is also made as free of edges as possible, the problem of a possible separation of the arriving flow can be reduced, and the turbulence can be increased in the inflow area of the groove as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The function of a pump device can also be assumed by a displacement body, provided on at least one of the two converter components in the area where the one converter component comes in contact with the groove in the other converter component, this displacement body fitting at least partially into this groove, thus narrowing its flow cross section. As a result of the relative motion between the two above-mentioned converter components in the circumferential direction with respect to each other, the displacement body has the effect of producing the desired forced flow through the groove, where, as a result of the flow resistance in the groove, the pressure reaches a maximum at a point which is immediately ahead of the displacement body in terms of the direction of motion and then decreases to a minimum behind the displacement body. Through the proper selection of the cross section of the grooves, the flow resistance in the groove system can be adjusted in such a way that a part of the flow volume is forced out of the groove system, while fresh hydraulic fluid is drawn in on the other side. Obviously, this inventive solution is not limited to an individual displacement body; on the contrary, it can be enhanced by the use of several such displacement bodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another way in which the pump device can be designed involves the creation of an eccentricity between the friction area and the opposing friction area and to enclose this eccentricity area with a seal extending radially around the outside. Relative movement between the friction area and the opposing friction area thus leads to the formation of a revolving displacer volume, so that every possible point of the friction area and of the opposing friction area is, wetted with hydraulic fluid during each revolution, as a result of which a superior cooling effect can be obtained. An especially characteristic feature of this solution is that the friction area and the opposing friction area approach each other to form a point of minimum separation distance. The pressure differences required for this principle to work are created in front of and behind this point, which is called the dynamic pressure point; in a preferred embodiment, these differences can be used to generate a volume flow rate through a lining provided with grooves. It is especially preferable for this system of grooves to have a zigzag or meander-shaped form or to have a waffle-shaped groove system. Because of the previously mentioned revolving wetting process, however, it is not absolutely necessary for the sake of the above-mentioned principle that the friction area or the opposing friction area be formed in one of these ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The previously mentioned point where the minimum radial distance is present between the friction area and the opposing friction area can be provided on the radially outer side of the friction linings, but it is equally possible to provide it on the radially inner side or even on both radial sides. For this purpose, preferably an area projecting in the axial direction is provided on the converter component without a friction lining, this axial extension enclosing the radially adjacent friction lining radially from the outside or approaching it radially from the inside. A design is conceivable here in which each of the axial extensions is in the form of a ring, whereas the associated friction lining has an elliptical shape. Nevertheless, this type of design variant should be limited to the use of lock-up clutches which have an even number of friction linings, so that, by arranging them with an angular offset with respect to each other, they can compensate for radial vibrations caused by the elliptical shape of the friction linings and thus successfully avoid any balance errors which may otherwise occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in greater detail below on the basis of a drawing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a hydrodynamic torque converter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is able to rotate around a rotational axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The hydrodynamic torque converter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a converter housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with a converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on the side facing a drive (not shown), such as an internal combustion engine. The converter cover is rigidly connected to an impeller shell <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The impeller shell is extended at the radially inner end to form an impeller hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To return to the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, this has in the radially inner area a bearing journal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which, in a manner known in itself and therefore not explained in detail, is mounted on an element of the drive such as a crankshaft, which therefore centers the converter housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the drive side. The converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also has an attachment seat <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is the conventional means for attaching the converter housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the drive, preferably by way of a flex plate (not shown). Reference is made by way of example to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of U.S. Pat. No. 4,523.916, which shows how the bearing journal of a torque converter is mounted on the crankshaft of a drive and how the torque converter is connected by way of a flex plate to the crankshaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The previously mentioned impeller shell <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the impeller vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> together form in impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which works together with a turbine wheel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which consists of a turbine wheel shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and turbine wheel vanes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and also together with a stator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the turbine wheel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and the stator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> form in a manner known in and of itself a hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which encloses an internal torus <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It should also be mentioned that the stator vanes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the stator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are attached to a stator hub <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is mounted on a free-wheel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The latter is braced axially by an axial support <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> against the impeller hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is connected nonrotatably but with freedom of axial movement by a gear-tooth system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to a support shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is located radially inside the impeller hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The support shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, designed as a hollow shaft, for its own part encloses a transmission input shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is provided with a central bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to allow the passage of hydraulic fluid. The transmission input shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected nonrotatably but with freedom of axial movement to a turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by means of a gear-tooth system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, where a radially outer area of this turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> provides a place for the attachment of a turbine wheel base <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is braced on one side by an axial support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> against the previously mentioned free-wheel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and rests on the other side by way of an axial support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> against the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Radially toward the inside, the turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is sealed off against the transmission input shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The previously mentioned central bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the transmission input shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> serves to supply the hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and to apply pressure to a lock-up clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, to be explained below, for which purpose connections to a control device and to a supply of hydraulic fluid are required. Neither the control device nor the hydraulic fluid reservoir are shown in the drawing, but they can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of previously cited U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,363, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Hydraulic fluid which has entered via the central bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the transmission input shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> arrives in a transition space <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and from this space it passes radially outward via channels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the axial support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which serves as a flow passage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, to a chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, located axially between the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the previously mentioned lock-up clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is centered with respect to the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The side of the piston facing away from the chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is directed toward the hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and, as a function of the pressure conditions in the hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and in the chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, it can move between two different limit positions, which will be discussed further below. The piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be shifted axially by means of a piston base <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, supported on the turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, where a piston seal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> recessed into the turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> exercises its sealing function against the base <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the piston. In the radially inner area of the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the piston is attached via tangential leaf springs <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and by a riveted joint <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to a holding device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which is designed as a single piece with the turbine hub <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and which is connected by another riveted joint <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the turbine wheel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided on its outside circumference with a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> proceeding in the circumferential direction, these openings being connected to opposing openings <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in an anti-rotation lock <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The latter is attached in turn to the turbine shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. It remains to be pointed out that the piston is connected nonrotatably but with freedom of axial movement to the anti-rotation lock <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via the openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>/opposing openings <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the radially outer area, on the side facing the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> carries a friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which encloses the rotational axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> like a ring and which, on the side facing away from the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, referred to below as the friction area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, can be brought into friction-locking connection with an opposing friction area <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> provided on the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, when the pressure in the hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is higher than that in the chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Friction area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and opposing friction area <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are emphasized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and will be explained later in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In a manner known in and of itself, the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can move axially between two possible limit positions, the first limit position being reached when the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> comes into contact by its friction area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> in a friction-locking manner with the opposing friction area <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The second limit position, however, is reached when the pressure in chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is greater than that in the hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is thus shifted axially until it comes into contact with a stop <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the holding device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, this movement being performed against the action of the tangential leaf springs <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which try to push the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> toward the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> To return to detail &ldquo;X&rdquo;, we can see that an intersecting line II-II (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is drawn through it. Looking in the direction indicated by this intersecting line, we see the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in the form of an enlarged isolated drawing of a segment of this friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. This segment of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which extends essentially in the form of an arc in the friction lining. Each groove proceeds first from an inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> toward the radially outer area, and then, having reached a crest point <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, goes back in the radially inward direction again, namely, to an outflow area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which, like the inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, opens out on the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In a groove of this design, a groove-free friction ring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which exerts a certain sealing effect while the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is in contact with the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, remains intact in the radially outer area of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, that is, radially between the crest point <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the radially outer side <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The design of the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is examined more closely below. The following description starts on the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> under the assumption that the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and thus the piston holding it rotate in the direction which allows the area of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on the right of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to act as the inflow side <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the area on the left of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to act as the outflow side <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the friction lining <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> rotates in the clockwise direction. In the circumferential direction between the inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the outflow area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided, which has a guide surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> facing the inflow side <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. This surface has the ability to deflect hydraulic fluid arriving from the inflow side into the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The guide surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> projects radially toward the inside, preferably with the same curvature as that of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> itself, extending beyond the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. After reaching its endpoint, which serves as a separation edge <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> for the flow, it proceeds back toward the outflow side <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, returning to the radial level of the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. This radially outward-extending area of the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> serves as a turbulence generator <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, because the hydraulic fluid diverted radially inward by the guide surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> attempts, as a result of centrifugal force, to flow radially back outward again behind the separation edge <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. This obviously does not succeed all at once but only after a turbulence region has been traversed, after which the hydraulic fluid can reach the flow guide side <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> of the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> a certain distance behind the separation edge <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and then continue to flow onward toward the outflow side <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With respect to the inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the guide surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is assisted by a dynamic pressure generator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which preferably is formed by extending the radially outside wall <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, preferably without any curvature, over a predetermined radial distance A from the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, so that the groove opens out on the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with a nearly edge-free transition <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As a result, the inflow area is expanded by an amount essentially equal to the angle alpha. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The dynamic pressure generator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in combination with the guide surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, has the effect of forcing the hydraulic fluid arriving from the inflow side into the inflow side <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, during which the dynamic pressure increases as a result of the increasing constriction of the cross section of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As a result, a forced flow is produced in the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which means that the hydraulic fluid already present in the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>&mdash;fluid which has become heated in the meantime&mdash;is forced out of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via the outflow area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the outflow side. Simultaneously, a portion of the hydraulic fluid arriving at the inflow side is conducted along the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, thus bypassing the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, as a result of the radially inward-projecting radial extension <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Some of this hydraulic fluid can be coolant which has already flowed through a groove preceding the present one and which accordingly has already been heated up to some extent. It can therefore be advantageous for only a portion of this hydraulic fluid to enter the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In summary, the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, in cooperation with the dynamic pressure generator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, serves as a pump device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which, as a result of the forced flow generated in the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, causes the heated hydraulic fluid to be forced out of the groove and also prevents the already heated hydraulic fluid from flowing through this groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Instead, the strong turbulence in the inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> causes the hydraulic fluid already heated by passage through preceding grooves to mix vigorously with fresh, newly arriving hydraulic fluid, and it is this relatively cool hydraulic fluid which is forced into the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In regard to the present embodiment, it should be mentioned in conclusion that the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be designed as a single piece with the rest of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The tool for stamping out the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from a sheet of friction lining material must therefore be designed with a circular shape on the radially outer side <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> but with a shape which conforms to the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the radially inner side <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. When a friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is stamped out in this way, the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be produced in a manner known in and of itself as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,621. It would also be possible, however, for the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to be produced as a separate element and then attached by the use of an adhesive, for example, to the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which has been stamped out in the form of a ring on both the radially outer and inner sides. In this case a recess is preferably introduced into the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which can be formed together with the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and which then serves as a receptacle for the baffle element <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to be bonded to the lining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a segment of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, but here the lining has a different design for the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. So that the principle according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> can be correctly understood, it should be studied together with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, because it can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that a displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, acting as a pump device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, is provided on one of the converter components, in the present case on the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be designed as a single piece with the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, but it can also be produced as a separate element and then attached later to the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Essential to the function of the displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is that it engages in the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on the radially inner side of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in such a way that it reduces the flow cross section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at this point. To illustrate this, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which shows an enlarged isolated drawing of detail X in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, shows the displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> with one free end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which fits into the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with a predetermined amount of axial clearance <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with respect to the base <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the groove. A predetermined amount of radial clearance <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also remains between the outside circumference <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the associated side walls <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The principle by which this pump device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> works is based on the fact that the displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is attached to one of the converter components, such as the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whereas the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is attached to the other converter component, which, in the present case, would therefore be the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As soon as relative rotation occurs between the two converter components <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as a result of slippage, for example, the displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shifted in the circumferential direction within the circumferential area <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. One side thus pushes a volume of hydraulic fluid ahead of it, so that fresh hydraulic fluid is drawn in on the opposite side by the resulting negative pressure. In this way, for example, hydraulic fluid which has entered via inflow areas <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and arrived via radial areas <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in the circumferential area <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is drawn in from the radially outer hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, whereas the displacement body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> forces the heated hydraulic fluid already in the circumferential area <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through at least one radial area <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the outflow area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> back out into the hydrodynamic circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Relative movement of the two converter components <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with respect to each other thus brings about forced flow in the groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and thus a more intensive flow through the grooves. Of course, the turbulence-caused mixing of heated hydraulic fluid with newly arriving fresh hydraulic fluid plays a role here, too, because velocity differences are induced in the hydraulic fluid as a result of pressure differentials, especially in the inflow and outflow areas of the groove systems <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Another active principle is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which, looking in the direction of line V-V of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, show a section of the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Characteristic of this design is an outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which is provided on the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and which projects toward the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This ring-shaped enclosure extends axially over part of the axial dimension of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are views along intersecting lines Va-Va and Vb-Vb in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, make it easy to understand this axial arrangement. The figures show the design of the outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the attachment of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> very clearly. It can also be clearly seen that the outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> rests almost without clearance radially against the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> at point Va to form a dynamic pressure point S in a manner to be explained in more detail below. Conversely, at point Vb, there remains a considerable radial gap. In the axial direction, there remains a residual gap <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> between the axially free end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, even when the lock-up clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> To return to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, we can see that the outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> encloses an opposing friction area <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which has a comparatively large diameter D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the outside edge of the friction area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a much smaller diameter D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, contrary to the design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, has a central axis <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which is separated from the rotational axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by an eccentricity E. When relative movement occurs in the circumferential direction between the two converter components <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> the dynamic pressure point S will shift in the circumferential direction, moving along the radially inner side <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and thus narrowing the flow gap <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> on the leading side, i.e., on the side facing in the direction of motion, and expanding it on the opposite side. In this way, a positive pressure is produced on the leading side of the dynamic pressure point S and a negative pressure on the trailing side. To this extent, the design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> involves another type of pump device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is responsible for creating a pressure-induced forced flow of hydraulic fluid in the action area of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In contrast to the preceding type, however, the friction area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> covers and uncovers continuously changing areas of the opposing friction area <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, so that new areas of this opposing friction area <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are continuously being wetted with cooling hydraulic fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the description of the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it has been assumed that the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has no grooves. Of course, it is also possible for a friction lining designed to implement the principle just described to be provided with grooves <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Possibly advantageous groove designs are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, each of which shows a segment of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has essentially a zigzag or meandering course, with both an inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and an outflow area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the radially outer side <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The entire groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is arranged radially within the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so that the lining still has a groove-free friction ring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> inside the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As a result, the amount of torque which can be transmitted can be increased, and at the same time a sealing effect with respect to the radial passage of hydraulic fluid is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As an alternative, the groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can also be designed with a waffle pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, preferably in combination with an additional groove <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, enclosing the waffle pattern area, which, proceeding from an inflow area <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the radially outer side <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> via a first groove part <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, extends essentially in the radial direction toward the inside until it reaches an intermediate groove part <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, which extends essentially in the circumferential direction. This intermediate grove part <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> in turn leads to a second, essentially radial groove part <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, which leads back on the radially outer side <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to an outflow area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this design of the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, too, a groove-free friction ring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> remains radially inside the intermediate part <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The designs described so far, especially that according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, show a so-called single-WK lock-up clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which means that a single friction lining is available to form a friction surface for the transmission of torque. In contrast to this, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>a double-WK lock-up clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which accordingly has a second friction area as a result of a second friction lining. To simplify the description, the friction lining on the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is designated as before by the reference number <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the friction area thus created by the number <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and the opposing friction area on the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by the number <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In contrast, the friction lining on the right side is designated in the following by the reference number <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the friction area thus created by the number <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and the opposing friction area on the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by the number <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Before this design is discussed in detail, it should be mentioned in advance that it is also conceivable for lock-up clutches to have four or more friction linings. A lock-up clutch of this type is not shown or described here, but it belongs to the state of the art. Reference can be made by way of example to WO 00/03158 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,380), which shows several designs of lock-up clutches with four friction linings. In any event, the lock-up clutch should have an even number of friction linings to prevent the occurrence of any possible balance errors, as will be explained in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Because the clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a double-WK lock-up clutch, the bearing journal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the converter housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is designed with a journal hub <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, which is rigidly connected by a weld <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and which has radial channels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with at least one radial component. The latter connect the radially inner transition space <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the radially outer chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, located between the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this design, the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is not equipped with a friction lining. Instead, the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are attached to a clutch disk <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the radially outer area of which is provided with openings <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, so that it can engage nonrotatably but with freedom of axial movement in opposing openings <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on the anti-rotation lock <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Each of the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has its own outer ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and inner ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The ring-shaped enclosures <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> cooperating with the friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as shown on the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are attached to the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>; the comparable ring-shaped enclosures <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which are assigned to the other friction lining <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, however, are attached to the piston <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. All the ring-shaped enclosures <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, like the ring-shaped enclosure <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are dimensioned in the axial direction in such a way that they leave a residual gap <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> with respect to the clutch disk <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> when the lock-up clutch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is closed. In this respect, therefore, reference is also made to the diagram of the residual gap <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, so that at this point another enlarged detail to illustrate the residual gap <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> between the clutch disk and ring-shaped enclosure does not appear necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to the view along intersecting line VII-VII in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the ring-shaped enclosures <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, are essentially circular, whereas the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> deviate from the circular. The friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are preferably elliptical in shape, where the dimensions of each friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are calculated so that the lining has an outside diameter only slightly smaller than the inner sides <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the outer ring-shape enclosures <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at the points S<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>, which are 180&deg; apart in the circumferential direction. Offset by 90&deg; in the circumferential direction, furthermore, are points S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>on the inside diameters of the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> at which the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are only slightly larger than the outer sides <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of the assigned inner ring-shaped enclosures <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The previously mentioned points S<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>are dynamic pressure points as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> described above, by means of which the function of the pump device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is achieved. As also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, relative movement of the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> with respect to the ring-shaped enclosures <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> attached to the opposing converter component, namely, to the converter cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, lead to a positive pressure on one side of the dynamic pressure point S<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>in question, whereas they lead to a negative pressure on the circumferentially opposite side. In a corresponding manner, hydraulic fluid is forced out of the flow gap <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> on the positive pressure side, whereas it is drawn in on the negative pressure side, so that the desired forced flow is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> therefore functions with respect to its active principle in the same way as the design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, but in spite of its simpler design it achieves even better efficiency, because the plurality of pressure points S<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>distribute the forced flow even more uniformly around the circumference. Nevertheless, in order to exclude undesirable balance errors caused by the elliptical shape of the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the second friction lining <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> should be rotated 90&deg; with respect to the first friction lining <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> before being attached to the clutch disk <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in the case of the second friction lining <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the outer pressure points S<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>as well as the inner pressure points S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>are each rotated 90&deg; with respect to the diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As a result of the functional principle described here, the design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> does not necessarily require a groove system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, but it can be effective to provide such a system as a supplement in order to bring about an even greater increase in the cooling effect, especially in the area over which the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> extend. In this context, reference should be made to the previously described <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, where the groove systems <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown there can also be provided in this design, at least on one of the friction linings <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
