Therefore, difficulty is encountered in &ldquo;obtaining a desired ratio of emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers&rdquo;; for example, causing the two low-energy-band-gap layers to emit at substantially the same intensity.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor light-emitting element containing a plurality of low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths, which easily attains &ldquo;desired proportions in emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers&rdquo; and which exhibits excellent emission efficiency and durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the present invention employs the following means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to first means of the present invention, there is provided a Group III nitride compound semiconductor light-emitting element formed of Group III nitride compound semiconductor layers, comprising multiple layers containing light-emitting layers (hereinafter collectively called &ldquo;a multi-layer containing light-emitting layers&rdquo; or &ldquo;a multi-layer&rdquo;), a p-type semiconductor layer, and an n-type semiconductor layer, wherein the multi-layer comprises a multiple quantum barrier-well layer containing quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers formed from a Group III nitride compound semiconductor and quantum-barrier-formation well layers formed from a Group III nitride compound semiconductor, the barrier layers and the well layers being laminated alternately and cyclically, and a plurality of low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths; and the multiple quantum barrier-well layer is provided between the low-energy-band-gap layers. Here &ldquo;low-energy band gap layer&rdquo; also includes a well layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the expression &ldquo;Group III nitride compound semiconductor&rdquo; encompasses binary, ternary, and quaternary semiconductors of arbitrary compositional proportions represented by the following formula: Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>(1&minus;x&minus;y)</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;x&lE;1, 0&lE;y&lE;1, 0&lE;x&plus;y&lE;1); and semiconductors containing trace amounts or small amounts of p-type or n-type impurities, the impurities having substantially no effect on the compositional proportions x and y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the expression &ldquo;Group III nitride compound semiconductor&rdquo; encompasses binary and ternary Group III nitride compound semiconductors, such as AlN, GaN, InN, AlGaN of arbitrary or appropriate compositional proportions, AlInN of arbitrary or appropriate compositional proportions, and GaInN of arbitrary or appropriate compositional proportions; and semiconductors containing trace amounts or small amounts of p-type or n-type impurities, the impurities having substantially no effect on the compositional proportions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The expression &ldquo;Group III nitride compound semiconductor&rdquo; encompasses semiconductors in which the aforementioned Group III element (Al, Ga, or In) is partially substituted by boron (B) or thallium (Tl), or in which nitrogen (N) is partially substituted by phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), or bismuth (Bi). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Examples of the aforementioned p-type impurity include magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Examples of the aforementioned n-type impurity include silicon (Si), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and germanium (Ge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These impurities may be incorporated in combination of two or more species, and a p-type impurity and an n-type impurity may be incorporated in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned low-energy-band-gap layer may have an SQW structure or an MQW structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the function of a multiple quantum barrier-well layer employed in the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows an energy band diagram of the multiple quantum barrier-well layer. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, reference letter Wb represents the thickness of a quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer constituting the multiple quantum barrier-well layer, Ww represents the thickness of a quantum-barrier-formation well layer constituting the multiple quantum barrier-well layer, and Vb represents the energy level of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When electrons are applied to the multiple quantum barrier-well layer from the left side of the drawing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the probability that the electrons are reflected to the left side (i.e., reflectance) is classically thought to be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference>, reference letter E on the x-axis represents the kinetic energy of electrons applied in a forward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However, in reality, electrons behave on the basis of the quantum theory. Therefore, by virtue of the tunnel effect or interference of electronic waves, the reflectance of electrons to the multiple quantum barrier-well layer substantially corresponds to the results of a quantum-theoretical simulation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, me (&equals;0.2) represents the ratio of the effective mass of conduction electrons to the rest mass of electrons in the multiple quantum barrier-well layer, the ratio being employed in the simulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When &ldquo;d&rdquo; represents the length of 1/2 the lamination cycle of each of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers constituting the multiple quantum barrier-well layer (2.5 nm in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and &ldquo;&lgr;&rdquo; represents the wavelength of conduction electrons injected to the multiple quantum barrier-well layer, conduction electrons satisfying the following relations exhibit high reflectance: d&equals;&lgr;/4, d&equals;3&lgr;/4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In contrast, conduction electrons satisfying the following relation exhibit low reflectance: d&equals;&lgr;/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the multiple quantum barrier-well layer exerting the aforementioned barrier effect is introduced, the height of an effective quantum barrier becomes considerably greater than that of a classical quantum barrier. In addition, conduction electrons having a specific kinetic energy E selectively pass through the multiple quantum barrier-well layer by virtue of the tunnel effect, even when the energy level of the conduction electrons is lower than the height of the classical quantum barrier. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, conduction electrons satisfying the following relation: &lgr;&equals;2d&equals;5 nm (i.e., conduction electrons having a kinetic energy E of about 0.3 eV) exhibit low reflectance by virtue of the tunnel effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the case where the aforementioned multiple quantum barrier-well layer is employed, even when the amount of Al contained in p-type and n-type semiconductor layers is reduced, and these semiconductor layers are of reduced thickness as compared with conventional p-type and n-type semiconductor layers, overflow of carriers is effectively prevented, and optimal or suitable distribution of the carriers to low-energy-band-gap layers is realized. Thus, as compared with a conventional light-emitting element, the resultant semiconductor element emitting light of different wavelengths exhibits excellent emission efficiency and durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an energy band diagram illustrating the effect of the multiple quantum barrier-well layer of the semiconductor light-emitting element of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, filled circles and open circles symbolically represent electrons and holes, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the multiple quantum barrier-well layer is provided between two low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light whose wavelengths are arbitrarily or appropriately different, distribution of electrons is determined on the basis of the quantum-theoretical effect as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Distribution of holes is determined as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and is similar to the distribution of electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when an appropriate multiple quantum barrier-well layer from which carriers having a specific kinetic energy E are reflected at a specific reflectance is employed in the first means of the present invention, the semiconductor light-emitting element containing a plurality of low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths easily attains &ldquo;desired proportions in carrier distribution (emission intensity) between the low-energy-band-gap layers&rdquo; and exhibits excellent emission efficiency and durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Since the aforementioned multiple quantum barrier-well layer exerts the effect of reducing stress applied to the low-energy-band-gap layers, the stress being attributed to strain in the light-emitting element, semiconductor layers of good crystallinity are grown, and the low-energy-band-gap layers, etc. maintain a high level of crystallinity. According to the first means, when the thicknesses, lamination cycles, compositional proportions, and number of semiconductor layers constituting the multiple quantum barrier-well layer are optically or suitably determined in accordance with the kinetic energy of carriers, the carriers can assume substantially uniform distribution between a plurality of the low-energy-band-gap layers, or desired proportions in carrier distribution between the low-energy-band-gap layers can be attained. More specifically, the following means are effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In second means of the present invention, preferably, the band gap of each of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers is determined to be larger than that corresponding to the wavelength of light emitted from each of the low-energy-band-gap layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In third means of the present invention, preferably, the thickness of each of the quantum-barrier-formation well layers or each of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers is determined to be 0.5 nm to 10 nm inclusive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In fourth means of the present invention, preferably, each of the quantum-barrier-formation well layers is formed from Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x&minus;y</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;x&lt;0.1, 0.8&lt;y&lt;1, 0&lt;1&minus;x&minus;y&lt;0.1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In fifth means of the present invention, preferably, each of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers is formed from Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;x&lt;0.5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain light of a desired color from the semiconductor light-emitting element of the present invention, the aforementioned second through fifth means may be arbitrarily selected and effectively employed in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For example, the multiple quantum barrier-well layer may have a structure in which the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers, each having a band gap larger than that corresponding to the wavelength of light emitted from each of the low-energy-band-gap layers, are laminated cyclically. Alternatively, the multiple quantum barrier-well layer may have a structure in which each of the quantum-barrier-formation well layers is formed from Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x&minus;y</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;x&lt;0.1, 0.8&lt;y&lt;1, 0&lt;1&minus;x&minus;y&lt;0.1), each of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers is formed from Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;x&lt;0.5), each of the quantum-barrier-formation well layers and the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers is determined to have a thickness of 0.5 nm to 10 nm inclusive, and the quantum-barrier-formation well layers and the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers are laminated cyclically. When the multiple quantum barrier-well layer having such a structure is employed, carriers can be assume a substantially uniform distribution between a plurality of the low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths, or desired proportions in carrier distribution between the low-energy-band-gap layers can be attained. Therefore, according to the aforementioned means, light of a desired color can be obtained from the semiconductor light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph showing criteria for forming a suitable or optimal multiple quantum barrier-well layer. For example, when the quantum-barrier-formation well layers of the multiple quantum barrier-well layer are formed from and the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers of the multiple quantum barrier-well layer are formed from Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;x&lt;0.5), the transmittance of carriers (electrons and holes) becomes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The relation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is obtained under the following conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> (Condition 1) the ratio of the effective mass of conduction electrons to the rest mass of electrons in the multiple quantum barrier-well layer: me&equals;0.2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> (Condition 2) lamination cycle of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer: twice the thickness of the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer (Wb&equals;Ww) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> (Condition 3) the number of quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers: 8 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> (Condition 4) operation voltage: 3 V </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> (Condition 5) temperature of the light-emitting element: about ambient temperature </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (Condition 6) kinetic energy of conduction electrons in an incident direction: about 0.2 to 0.5 eV </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer has a thickness of 2.5 nm, and the compositional proportion of Al contained in the quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer is 0.3; i.e., x&equals;0.3, the transmittance of carriers becomes about 1/2. Therefore, carriers can assume substantially uniform distribution between the low-energy-band-gap layers provided on the respective surfaces of the multiple quantum barrier-well layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the case where a plurality of multiple quantum barrier-well layers are provided between three or more low-energy-band-gap layers (each of the multiple quantum barrier-well layers is provided between the low-energy-band-gap layers), when the transmittance of carriers which pass through each of the multiple quantum barrier-well layers is optimally or suitably determined such that the carriers are distributed to the low-energy-band-gap layers in desired proportions, light of uniform intensity can be obtained from the low-energy-band-gap layers, or desired proportions in emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Such optimization may be carried out by means of, for example, calculation for obtaining proportions of carriers having a specific kinetic energy distributed to the low-energy-band-gap layers, on the basis of the transmittance of the carriers which pass through the respective multiple quantum barrier-well layers. Alternatively, such optimization may be carried out on the basis of the results of a variety of simulations and tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the means of the present invention is employed, in the semiconductor light-emitting element containing a plurality of low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths, quantitative optimization for improving emission efficiency and attaining desired proportions in emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers; i.e., regulating color of emitted light, can be carried out easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Each of the aforementioned conditions 1 through 6 is not a necessary condition for the present invention. Therefore, there may be employed any multiple quantum barrier-well layer satisfying the following relation: Wb&gt;Ww; i.e., a multiple quantum barrier-well layer containing a quantum-barrier-formation barrier layer having a thickness greater than that of a quantum-barrier-formation well layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> That is, the aforementioned conditions 1 through 6 may be optimally or suitably varied in accordance with desired properties of the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In sixth means of the present invention, preferably, operation voltage is varied to thereby change the color of emitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the transmittance of electrons which pass through the multiple quantum barrier-well layer or the reflectance of electrons depends on, for example, the kinetic energy of the electrons. Furthermore, as shown by the aforementioned condition <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the transmittance or reflectance depends on the operation voltage of the light-emitting element. Therefore, when the operation voltage of the light-emitting element is varied, carriers can be distributed to the low-energy-band-gap layers in arbitrary proportions. In addition, when the operation voltage of the light-emitting element is varied, proportions in emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers can be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The color of light emitted from the light-emitting element is determined by colors of light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers; i.e., proportions of intensities of light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers. Therefore, according to the sixth means, the color of light emitted from the light-emitting element can be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described above, when carriers are distributed to the low-energy-band-gap layers in desired proportions, the semiconductor light-emitting element (i.e., single-chip-type element) can emit light of desired color by appropriately regulating operation voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A conventional outdoor large-screen television employs three types of LEDs; i.e., a red LED, a green LED, and a blue LED. However, when the semiconductor light-emitting element (i.e., single-chip-type element) which emits light of desired color is employed, such a large-screen television may be produced from only one or two types of LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In seventh means of the present invention, preferably, there is provided a phosphor which receives light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layer and emits light having a wavelength longer than that of the light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When such a phosphor is provided, the amount of unwanted light of relatively short wavelength (e.g., UV light) which is emitted from the light-emitting element can be reduced, and the short-wavelength light can be converted to light of relatively long wavelength. Therefore, provision of the phosphor is effective particularly when light of a desired color is to be obtained through conversion of light by means of the phosphor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Provision of the phosphor is also effective when a color of emitted light which has been converted by means of the phosphor is to be mixed with emitted light of other colors. According to the seventh means, a color of light emitted from the light-emitting element can be corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In eighth means of the present invention, preferably, there is provided an impurity-added semiconductor layer which receives light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layer and emits light having a wavelength longer than that of the light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When such an impurity-added semiconductor layer is provided, the amount of unwanted light of relatively short wavelength (e.g., UV light) which is emitted from the light-emitting element can be reduced, and the short-wavelength light can be converted to light of relatively long wavelength. Therefore, provision of the impurity-added semiconductor layer is effective particularly when light of a desired color is to be obtained through conversion of light by means of the semiconductor layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Provision of the impurity-added semiconductor layer is also effective, when emitted light of a color which has been converted by means of the semiconductor layer is to be mixed with emitted light of other colors. According to the eighth means, a color of light emitted from the light-emitting element can be corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The means employing an impurity-added semiconductor layer may be combined with the aforementioned means employing a phosphor. In some cases, this combination enables sufficient correction of a color of light emitted from the light-emitting element. However, in the case where light which has been converted by means of an impurity-added semiconductor layer has a high luminance, even when the eighth means is carried out singly, sufficient effect may be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In ninth means of the present invention, preferably, at least one element selected from among silicon (Si), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and germanium (Ge), serving as an impurity, is added to the aforementioned impurity-added semiconductor layer. These impurities effectively convert light of relatively short wavelength, such as UV light, to visible light. Through addition of such an impurity, emission efficiency of the light-emitting element can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, when a semiconductor layer (e.g., a GaN layer) containing an appropriate amount of such an n-type impurity is irradiated with UV light, visible light is obtained through photoluminescence. Therefore, the ninth means is particularly effective when UV light is to be converted to visible light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When an impurity-added semiconductor layer which receives UV light and emits yellow light is added to a semiconductor light-emitting element containing a low-energy-band-gap layer which emits UV light and a low-energy-band-gap layer which emits blue light, the resultant semiconductor light-emitting element emits white light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In tenth means of the present invention, preferably, the aforementioned impurity-added semiconductor layer serves as an n-type semiconductor layer, an n-type contact layer, or a high-carrier-concentration n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> layer, and electrode formation or electrode connection is carried out through a flip chip process such that light is extracted through a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the above case, emitted UV light passes through the aforementioned impurity-added semiconductor layer, and thus the amount of UV light which is converted to visible light increases as compared with the case of a wire-bonding-type light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the tenth means, the color of emitted light can be corrected more effectively through conversion of the wavelength of the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When a low-energy-band-gap layer which emits red light is irradiated with photons of blue light, in some cases, electrons are excited in a light-emitting mechanism (band gap) of the low-energy-band-gap layer, and the excited electrons contribute to emission of red light in the mechanism. Through this effect, a portion of blue light is converted to red light. The greater the amount of light of short wavelength applied to a low-energy-band-gap layer which emits light of long wavelength, the greater the amount of light of short wavelength converted to light of long wavelength. That is, the greater the amount of light of short wavelength applied to the aforementioned impurity-added semiconductor layer, the greater the amount of light of short wavelength converted to light of long wavelength. The amount of light of short wavelength applied to a low-energy-band-gap layer which emits light of long wavelength greatly depends on the order of lamination of light-emitting semiconductor layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Since the order of lamination of light-emitting semiconductor layers is employed as a parameter for optimization of the color of light emitted from the light-emitting element or emission efficiency, when the lamination order is optimally or suitably regulated, the color of light emitted from the element can be easily converted to white. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In eleventh means, preferably, light-emitting semiconductor layers are laminated such that a semiconductor layer which emits light of a shorter wavelength is provided closer to a light extraction side of the light-emitting element. The term &ldquo;light-emitting semiconductor layer&rdquo; refers to the aforementioned low-energy-band-gap layer which emits light spontaneously. However, the term &ldquo;light-emitting semiconductor layer&rdquo; encompasses a semiconductor layer which emits light secondarily, inductively, or indirectly, through conversion of UV light of relatively short wavelength to visible light of long wavelength by means of, for example, photoluminescence. That is, the term &ldquo;light-emitting semiconductor layer&rdquo; encompasses the aforementioned impurity-added semiconductor layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to the eleventh means, the amount of light of short wavelength converted to light of long wavelength can be reduced, and extraction efficiency of emitted light can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Therefore, unintended change of color of light emitted from the light-emitting element, which is attributed to conversion of the wavelength of the light, is easily avoided. According to the eleventh means, the effect of such conversion (i.e., secondary effect) on the color of light emitted from the light-emitting element is not necessarily a strong consideration, and the light-emitting element can be designed with relative ease. In addition, chromaticity of light emitted from the element can be regulated easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the intensity of visible light of short wavelength (e.g., blue light) emitted from a low-energy-band-gap layer is relatively low, the eleventh means is effectively employed for maintaining the intensity at a certain level. However, the terms &ldquo;short wavelength&rdquo; and &ldquo;long wavelength&rdquo; are used merely on a relative basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> According to the first through eleventh means, the aforementioned object of the present invention can be effectively attained.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A first low-energy-band-gap layer A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing In<highlight><subscript>0.17</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.83</subscript></highlight>N (thickness: about 4 nm), which emits blue light and has an SQW structure, is laminated on the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A multiple quantum barrier-well layer A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> laminated on the first low-energy-band-gap layer A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes 15 semiconductor layers. Specifically, the multiple quantum barrier-well layer A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes quantum-barrier-formation barrier layers a<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> formed from Al<highlight><subscript>0.06</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.7</subscript></highlight>N (thickness of each layer: about 2.5 nm) and quantum-barrier-formation well layers a<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed from Al<highlight><subscript>0.06</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>0.01</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.93</subscript></highlight>N (thickness of each layer: about 2.5 nm), the layers a<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being laminated alternately (number of lamination cycles: 7.5). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor light-emitting element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> enables production of a full-color single-chip-type white LED which can reproduce a wide range of color.

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> When the low-energy-band-gap layer which emits light of a shorter wavelength is provided closer to a light extraction side as in the case of the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, since light emitted from all the low-energy-band-gap layers is not absorbed by the low-energy-band-gap layer provided close to the light extraction side, extraction efficiency of emitted light can be enhanced, and chromaticity of the emitted light can be easily regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As shown in the chromaticity diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when a triangular color production profile is formed by chromaticities corresponding to low-energy-band-gap layers which emit red light, green light, and blue light, a wide range of color can be reproduced. The blue-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer may emit violet light (380 to 455 nm); i.e., light having a wavelength shorter than that of blue light (455 to 485 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The light-emitting element of the second embodiment may include, in addition to the low-energy-band-gap layers which emit red light, green light, and blue light, a low-energy-band-gap layers which emits yellow light or blue-green light. Thus, when the number of low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths is increased, a tetragonal or pentagonal color production profile can be formed in the chromaticity diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Therefore, the resultant light-emitting element enables production of a full-color single-chip white LED which can reproduce a wider range of color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the case where such a polygonal color production profile is formed in the chromaticity diagram, when mean coordinates (x, y) in terms of lightness corresponding to light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers are regulated in the chromaticity diagram such that the mean coordinates substantially correspond to the coordinates of a white point W (1/3, 1/3), there can be obtained a full-color single-chip white LED which can reproduce a wide range of color when employed in a white illumination apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In the first and second embodiments, lightness of emitted light of different wavelengths is regulated by varying the thicknesses of the low-energy-band-gap layers.

<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor light-emitting element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment emits substantially no UV light or infrared light.

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned embodiments are drawn to a single-chip white LED of wire bonding type. However, the present invention may be applied to a single-chip white LED of arbitrary type (e.g., flip chip type). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> When a light-emitting element of flip chip type is produced, the order of lamination of a plurality of low-energy-band-gap layers is reversed in relation to the case of the aforementioned embodiments. Therefore, when the flip-chip-type light-emitting element is produced, like the case of the aforementioned embodiments, a low-energy-band-gap layer which emits light of a shorter wavelength is provided closer to a light extraction side of the light-emitting element. As a result, light emitted from all the low-energy-band-gap layers is not absorbed by the low-energy-band-gap layer provided close to the light extraction side. Therefore, the resultant light-emitting element enables production of a full-color single-chip white LED which exhibits high light extraction efficiency and which can reproduce a wide range of color. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> When an operation voltage of about 3 V is applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> having the aforementioned structure, the proportions of conduction electrons distributed to the first low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the second low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the third low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> become high:medium:low, and the proportions of holes distributed to the layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> become low:medium:high. Therefore, when an operation voltage of about 3 V is applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the intensity of light emitted from the second low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in which conduction electrons and holes are distributed in a well-balanced manner, becomes the highest.

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Under application of an operation voltage of about 5 V, since carriers are distributed to the low-energy-band-gap layers B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in ideal proportions, the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> emits white light of high intensity at high emission efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> When an operation voltage of about 7 V is applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the kinetic energy level of carriers becomes substantially corresponds to &ldquo;overflow prevention energy level&rdquo; at which overflow of carriers is effectively prevented by virtue of the interference effect of the multiple quantum barrier-well layers. Therefore, since the reflectance of carriers to the multiple quantum barrier-well layers C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> becomes considerably high, the carriers encounter difficulty in passing through the barrier-well layers. Such tendency is observed to be considerable in holes injected to the multiple layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> from the p-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the proportions of conduction electrons distributed to the first low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the second low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the third low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> become high:low:low, and the proportions of holes distributed to the layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> become very low low:high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when an operation voltage of about 7 V is applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the intensity of light emitted from the third low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> becomes the highest, and thus the element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> emits blue light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As described above, when operation voltage applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment is increased from 3 V to 5 V and further to 7 V, the color of light emitted from the element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is changed from green to white to blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Since the color of light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is varied in accordance with the proportions of carriers distributed to the low-energy-band-gap layers, when the order of lamination of the first, second, and third low-energy-band-gap layers B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is appropriately varied, a desired color of light is obtained from the element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> under application of a specific operation voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case where the green-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided on the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the red-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided above the layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the blue-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided above the layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and operation voltage applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment is increased from 3 V to 5 V and further to 7 V, the color of light emitted from the element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is changed from red to white to blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In the case where the blue-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided on the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the red-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided above the layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the green-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided above the layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and operation voltage applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment is increased from 3 V to 5 V and further to 7 V, the color of light emitted from the element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is changed from red to white to green. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the case where the blue-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided on the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the green-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided above the layer B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the red-light-emitting low-energy-band-gap layer B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided above the layer B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and operation voltage applied to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment is increased from 3 V to 5 V and further to 7 V, the color of light emitted from the element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is changed from green to white to red. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> No particular limitation is imposed on the number of the low-energy-band-gap layers. That is, even when the number of the low-energy-band-gap layers is desirably or arbitrarily varied, to thereby produce a semiconductor light-emitting element, the resultant light-emitting element exhibits the effects of the present invention. No particular limitation is imposed on the wavelengths of light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Similar to the case of the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in the semiconductor light-emitting element <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the intensity of light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers may be regulated through the aforementioned means (M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to (M<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> schematically shows an energy band diagram of a semiconductor light-emitting element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment including a multiple layer containing light-emitting layers. When the present invention is carried out, as in the case of the semiconductor light-emitting element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, low-energy-band-gap layers which sandwich a multiple quantum barrier-well layer may have a multiple quantum well (MQW) structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> A barrier layer constituting the MQW structure may be formed of, for example, a GaN layer. Alternatively, the barrier layer may be formed of a layer having an energy band gap greater than that of the low-energy-band-gap layer, such as an AlGaN layer, an AlN layer, an AlInN layer, or an InAlGaN layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the MQW structure of the light-emitting-layers-containing multiple layer of the light-emitting element of the present invention, electron waves may interfere with one another between the quantum-barrier-formation well layers. The low-energy-band-gap layers of the light-emitting element of the present invention may have a single quantum well (SQW) structure or a multiple quantum well (MQW) structure. Each of the low-energy-band-gap layers of the light-emitting element of the present invention may contain a thin barrier layer. The low-energy-band-gap layers of the light-emitting element of the present invention may interfere with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to a semiconductor light-emitting element including low-energy-band-gap layers having such an arbitrary structure. That is, in the present invention, no particular limitation is imposed on the structure of the low-energy-band-gap layers, and the low-energy-band-gap layers may have an SQW structure or an MQW structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Therefore, low-energy-band-gap layers having known or arbitrary structure may be employed in the light-emitting element of the present invention, and the effects of the present invention can be obtained from the resultant light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> When the compositional proportions, thicknesses, and number of semiconductor layers constituting the light-emitting-layers-containing multiple layer, and the type and amount of impurities added to the semiconductor layers are optimally or suitably regulated, mean coordinates (x, y) in terms of lightness corresponding to emitted light of different wavelengths can be regulated in the chromaticity diagram such that the mean coordinates substantially correspond to the coordinates of a white point W (1/3, 1/3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The wavelength (emission spectrum) of light emitted from each of the low-energy-band-gap layers may be determined in accordance with the compositional proportions of the low-energy-band-gap layer, or the type and amount of an impurity added to the low-energy-band-gap layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Addition of impurities to a low-energy-band-gap layer is effective when light of relatively long wavelength is to be emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layer through donor to acceptor pair (DAP) emission. For example, when red light is to be emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layer, appropriate amounts of an acceptor impurity such as Zn or Mg and a donor impurity such as S, Si, or Te are added to the low-energy-band-gap layer. Impurities may be added to the low-energy-band-gap layer in order to attain bound-to-free (BF) emission or free-to-bound (FB) emission. Therefore, either of these acceptor and donor impurities may be added to the low-energy-band-gap layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> For example, when red light is to be emitted from a low-energy-band-gap layer, the following means is effective or applicable: the low-energy-band-gap layer is formed from Al<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>1&minus;y</subscript></highlight>N (0&lE;y&lE;0.1), and appropriate amounts of an acceptor impurity such as Zn or Mg and a donor impurity such as S, Si, or Te are added to the low-energy-band-gap layer during crystal growth of the layer. Through such means, without employing arsenic (As) or an arsenic compound which requires high-cost production equipment, there can be produced a light-emitting element which emits visible light of long wavelength (i.e., red light), which can reproduce a wide range of color, and which is suitable for use in a white illumination apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Examples of the acceptor impurity which may be employed include, in addition to zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg), Group II elements and Group IV elements, such as beryllium (Be), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba). Examples of the donor impurity which may be employed include, in addition to sulfur (S), silicon (Si), and tellurium (Te), Group IV elements and Group VI elements, such as carbon (C), tin (Sn), and selenium (Se). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> When such an acceptor impurity or a donor impurity is added to a low-energy-band-gap layer, the concentration of the impurity is preferably 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>21</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. For example, in the case of donor to acceptor pair (DAP) emission, so long as the concentration of each of the acceptor impurity and donor impurity falls within the above range, light emission occurs through electron transition between the energy levels of the impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The emission intensities of low-energy-band-gap layers, and the proportions in emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers can be regulated by varying the thicknesses of the low-energy-band-gap layers or the number of the layers. Alternatively, as described above, the emission intensities of low-energy-band-gap layers, and the proportions in emission intensity between the low-energy-band-gap layers can be regulated by optimally or suitably determining the transmittance of carriers which pass through multiple quantum barrier-well layers, or the reflectance of carriers which are reflected from the barrier-well layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> As described above, the compositional proportions of low-energy-band-gap layers, and the types and amounts of impurities added to the low-energy-band-gap layers can be employed as parameters for determining the wavelengths of light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers. The thicknesses of low-energy-band-gap layers which emit light of different wavelengths and the number of the low-energy-band-gap layers can be employed as parameters for determining the intensities (chromaticities) of light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the aforementioned parameters are optimally regulated in each of the low-energy-band-gap layers, through mixing of emitted light of different colors, an arbitrary color can be reproduced within a polygonal color reproduction profile formed by connecting chromaticity coordinates (x<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, y<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) corresponding to light emitted from the low-energy-band-gap layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> That is, optimization of the aforementioned parameters easily attains efficient production of a semiconductor light-emitting element which emits white light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> When the compositional proportions, thicknesses, and number of the aforementioned impurity-added semiconductor layers, and the type and amount of impurities contained in the semiconductor layers are optimally or suitably regulated, mean coordinates (x, y) in terms of lightness corresponding to emitted light of different wavelengths can be regulated in the chromaticity diagram such that the mean coordinates substantially correspond to the coordinates of a white point W (1/3, 1/3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Through such regulation, efficiency in conversion of UV light to visible light and the amount of such conversion can be optimized. Therefore, emission efficiency of the light-emitting element can be improved, and the color of light emitted from the element can be easily converted to white. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> When the order of lamination of light-emitting semiconductor layers is optimally or suitably regulated, mean coordinates (x, y) in terms of lightness corresponding to emitted light of different wavelengths can be regulated in the chromaticity diagram such that the mean coordinates substantially correspond to the coordinates of a white point W (1/3, 1/3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Examples of the material which may be employed for forming the substrate through crystal growth include, in addition to the aforementioned sapphire, known or arbitrary materials such as spinel, manganese oxide, lithium gallium oxide (LiGaO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), molybdenum sulfide (MoS), silicon (Si), silicon carbide (SiC), GaN, AlN, GaAs, InP, GaP, MgO, ZnO, and MgAl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The material used for forming the aforementioned buffer layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not limited to AlN, but may be AlGaN, GaN, InAlGaN or a similar material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> When crystal growth is carried out by use of a bulk crystal substrate formed from, for example, gallium nitride (GaN), the aforementioned buffer layer is not necessarily provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Particularly when an electrically conductive substrate is employed, various known advantages related to an electrically conductive substrate may be obtained. For example, positive and negative electrodes can be formed such that the electrodes sandwich the substrate and a multiple layer containing light-emitting layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
