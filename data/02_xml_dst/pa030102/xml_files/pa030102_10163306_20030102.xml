<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is related to and claims priority, under 35 U.S.C. &sect;119, from Japanese Patent Application No. 13-172860, filed on Jun. 7, 2001 in the Japanese Patent Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a sheet feeding apparatus for use in an image forming apparatus, such as a copier, a facsimile, a printer, etc. and more particularly, to a sheet feeding apparatus including a sheet containing tray having a side guide member that aligns side ends of sheets contained in the sheet containing tray and withdrawable from the image forming apparatus in a direction perpendicular to a sheet feeding direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A so-called front loading type sheet feeding apparatus has been known in the past. Specifically, a front loading type sheet feeding apparatus includes: a sheet containing tray withdrawable from a housed position to a front side of the apparatus body; a sheet feeding device for feeding sheets in a direction approximately perpendicular to the withdrawal direction of the sheet containing tray; and a pair of side guide members extending in parallel to a sheet feeding direction for aligning side ends of the sheets. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> pair of rear and front side fences <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are arranged to align side ends of sheets P in a widthwise direction B perpendicular to the sheet feeding direction A in a sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of such a front loading type of sheet feeding apparatus. Also provided is an end fence <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for aligning a sheet trailing end upstream of the sheet feeding direction A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The sheets P are raised by a bottom plate lifting apparatus (not shown) and then fed by the sheet feeding device, such as a feeding roller, when the uppermost sheet reaches a sheet feeding position located at a prescribed height &ldquo;h&rdquo; for the sheet feeding device. In the sheet feeding apparatus, when the sheets P are fed and a sheet jam occurs in the sheet containing tray, a leading end of a jammed sheet P&prime; possibly remains in the vicinity of the feeding roller. Thus, when a user draws the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the widthwise direction B in order to remove the jammed sheet P&prime;, the jammed sheet P&prime; can unfortunately climb over a rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In particular, when a small size sheet is utilized, a problem sometimes arises such that the small size sheet sneaks through a gap &ldquo;s&rdquo; formed between a right side wall <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&prime; of the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and remains in the apparatus body of the image forming apparatus as illustrated by a dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. When the jammed sheet P&prime;, after having climbed over the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, remains in the apparatus body of the image forming apparatus, it is difficult for a user to remove the jammed sheet P&prime;, and a situation known as &ldquo;call jam,&rdquo; requiring a request to a service person, arises. Accordingly, a prompt jam recovery operation is disadvantageously not achieved. As a result, a working ratio is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 9-77291 refers to a sheet remaining avoiding mechanism used for the similar purpose. Specifically, a protruding section is upwardly formed from the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and is setback from a rear side of a sheet setting range (i.e., a rear side end of a sheet P). Thus, when the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is withdrawn, the jammed sheet P&prime; collides with the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and is largely bent. However, jammed sheet P&prime; is not blocked by the protruding section and climbs over the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the protruding section. If the protruding section hangs over at a position certainly higher than an upper surface of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a jammed sheet P&prime; can surely be prevented from climbing over the rear side fence <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the protruding section. However, due to multi-step tendency in sheet containing trays of an image forming apparatus of recent date, a height per a step is suppressed, and as a result, that of the vertically protruding section cannot sufficiently be assigned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the sheet remaining avoiding mechanism of Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 9-175677 has a complex configuration. Specifically, sheet replenishment is disadvantageously difficult because a pair of sheet suppressing members largely horizontally protrude from respective rear side and front side fences <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> toward a sheet stack range. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to address and resolve the above-noted and other problems of prior art sheet feeding apparatus and to provide a new sheet feeding apparatus. The above and other objects are achieved according to the present invention by providing a novel sheet feeding apparatus including a sheet containing tray withdrawable from a housed position to a front side of an apparatus body. A sheet-feeding device is provided so as to feed a sheet in the sheet containing tray in a direction perpendicular to the withdrawal direction of the sheet containing tray. A pair of side aligning members are also provided so as to align widthwise ends of the sheets in the sheet containing tray. The aligning member of the rear side in the withdrawal direction includes a hitching member, horizontally protruding toward a sheet setting range, to hitch and prevent a sheet from remaining when the sheet containing tray is withdrawn. The hitching member includes a protruding plate so as to overhang the uppermost sheet set on the sheet containing tray at a position a prescribed length downstream of a downstream end of the rear side-aligning member. A joining member is also provided so as to join the protruding plate and the rear side aligning member. The joining member positions a prescribed length behind a rear side end of the sheets aligned by the rear side aligning member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the protruding plate slightly protrudes from the rear side end of the sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the protruding plate includes a slanted and bent portion at its front side or rear side.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> schematic front elevational view of an image forming apparatus having an exemplary sheet feeding apparatus is illustrated. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> sheet containing tray attaching section may be formed in an apparatus body of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to attach a sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or similar. Three sheet containing trays <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be typically arranged and are enabled to slide back and forth on rails <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Thus, the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be withdrawable from the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a forward direction shown by an arrow B from a front side of the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> One of sheet containing trays <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrating cross sectional views taken along lines IIIA/IIIB-IIIA/IIIB, IV-IV, VA/VB-VA/VB of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, respectively. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include a pair of rear and front side fences <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> serving as side aligning members for aligning both side ends of a sheet P in a widthwise direction approximately perpendicular to a sheet feeding direction shown by an arrow A. Also included may be an end fence <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for aligning a trailing end of the sheet P directed in the sheet feeding direction A. Such a sheet P may be set onto a bottom plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A bottom plate elevation apparatus may be provided. The bottom plate elevation apparatus includes an elevation arm <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for lifting the bottom plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an elevation shaft <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for rotating the elevation arm <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> below the bottom plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An elevation motor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be provided in the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and transmit rotational driving force to the elevation shaft <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set in the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a setting detection device (not shown) may detect the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then the elevation motor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may rotate. A coupling <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may mesh and transmit the driving force to the elevation shaft <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Thus, the elevation arm <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may lift the bottom plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When the uppermost sheet reaches a prescribed sheet feeding position, the elevation motor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may stop driving, and thereby a sheet feeding available condition may be entered. In contrast, when the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus, the coupling <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may disengage from the elevation shaft <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As a result, the sheets P and bottom plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be lowered by gravity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The sheet-feeding device provided in the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be a conventional friction separation type and mainly include a pickup roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a feed roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a reverse roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The pickup roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the feed roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be engaged with an idler (not shown). The reverse roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may always be oppositely rotated to a feeding direction so as to separate sheets P one by one. Among the rear and front side fences <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the sheet feeding apparatus, a hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> while being directed in the direction B that sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is withdrawn so as to hitch and prevent a sheet P from remaining in the apparatus body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may include a horizontally protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> overhanging a sheet setting range, and a connecting member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for connecting the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the horizontally protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may overhang the uppermost sheet, the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> being disposed downstream of a downstream end of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, a gap &ldquo;r1&rdquo; (i.e., a space where the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is omitted) may be formed between the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the downstream side of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Further, a connecting member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may maintain the gap &ldquo;r1,&rdquo; the connecting member being set back from the sheet setting range of the sheets P stacked in front of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, another gap &ldquo;r<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; may be formed as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Further, the horizontally protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> may be maintained at a prescribed height &ldquo;h&rdquo; not to contact the uppermost sheet when the bottom plate is lifted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Driving may be immediately stopped in order to prevent progression of the disease of a jam condition when a jam occurs in the apparatus body of the image forming apparatus. In such a case, jam treatment is performed while opening a vertical sheet conveyance path as illustrated by a dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, a jammed sheet P&prime;, whose leading end is stopped in the vicinity of the feed roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, cannot be treated because the jammed portion thereof is too far from the opening section to reach, and then the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is withdrawn to the front side by an operator. The jammed sheet P&prime; necessarily collides with the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and thereby sometimes is largely bent by the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> when the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is withdrawn in the direction B as mentioned earlier. In this situation, if the hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is positioned at a middle portion of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the sheet feeding direction and upwardly extends there, the jammed sheet P&prime; highly probably climbs over the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from its largely bent portion. In contrast, since the hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located downstream of the downstream side end of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as in the present invention, the jammed sheet P&prime; may not collide with, or sometimes only slightly collide with, the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the jammed sheet P&prime;, which has a less bent amount at its downstream side end than the other portion of the sheet, may enter into the gaps &ldquo;r1&rdquo; and &ldquo;r2&rdquo; in this order, and then be hitched by the hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, since the hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located downstream of the downstream end of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a jammed sheet P&prime; having a small size may be prevented from remaining, which is generally caused because its trailing end tends to sneak through a gap formed between the right side wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and rear side fence <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, since a front side end of the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> horizontally protrudes toward the sheet setting range by a slight amount &ldquo;d&rdquo;, the jammed sheet P&prime; may more easily enter into both the gaps &ldquo;r1&rdquo; and &ldquo;r2&rdquo;. Specifically, it may credibly be hitched and withdrawn together with the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The slight amount &ldquo;d&rdquo; may not spoil a sheet-setting performance in view of sheet bending when the stack of sheets P is set from above. Since the hitching member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> protrudes toward the sheet setting range by the slight amount &ldquo;d&rdquo;, a sheet P can be damaged depending upon a setting manner in the above described embodiment. Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, since the leading section (i.e., a front side end) of the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a slanted and bent portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the slanted and bent portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may guide a stack of sheets P when it is loaded and prevent the same from being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the other leading section (i.e., a rear side end) of the protruding plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> also includes a slanted and bent portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, both slanted and bent portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may guide each sheet P of the stack of sheets P to the housed position while preventing the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from colliding with either the apparatus body of the image forming apparatus or a upper sheet containing tray. In addition, sheet damage may also be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For the friction separation roller type sheet-feeding apparatus described earlier, a friction pad type sheet feeding apparatus can be employed. The above-described hitching section, which is integral with the rear side fence, can be separated therefrom. Further, the above-described sheet feeding apparatus, integral with the image forming apparatus, can be separated therefrom and employ the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a second hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can be provided in addition to and in an upstream position of the hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> on the rear side fence <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The second hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may also include a horizontally protruding plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> at a rear side of the sheet setting range on the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a connecting portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> for connecting the protruding plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to the rear side fence <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and an eave <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> projecting downstream from the protruding plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A height of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be lowered at a portion attaching the hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> than the remaining portion of the rear side fence <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Thus, a gap &ldquo;r3&rdquo; may be formed between the protruding plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and rear side fence <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, even when the jammed sheet P&prime; rarely climbs over the hitching member <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, an upstream portion of the jammed sheet P&prime; can possibly be hitched by the second hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and enter into the gap &ldquo;r3&rdquo;. Thus, the jammed sheet P&prime; can be withdrawn together with the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Since the rear side fence <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is lowered at the attaching portion of the hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, the gap &ldquo;r3&rdquo; can be large enough to hitch a jammed sheet P&prime;. In addition, the second hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may also be set back from the sheet setting range, the stack of sheets P may not collide with the hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and avoid damage therefrom when set on the sheet containing tray <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Further, the second hitching section <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may preferably be positioned substantially at the center of a side of the smallest sheet among various sizes of sheets. In such a situation, it surely hitches the jammed sheet P&prime; having the smaller size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Obviously, numerous additional modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
