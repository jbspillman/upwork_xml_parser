<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device. More specifically, it relates to a method of manufacturing a compound semiconductor device using viaholes (through-chip holes) in order to improve the high frequency properties of the semiconductor device or to prevent temperature rise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A technique for the formation of &ldquo;viaholes&rdquo; has become important in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (hereinafter abbreviated as MMICs) and other superhigh frequency semiconductor devices. In this technique, a substrate is grounded from its back side via through-chip holes in order to improve the high frequency properties or to dissipate heat generated during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such viaholes are generally formed according to the following process as described in, for example, Proc. IEEE GaAs IC Symposium, pp. 267-270 (1992). Specifically, a semiconductor substrate carrying a semiconductor device formed on its principal surface is thinned by backside grinding, backside lapping or polishing, the thinned semiconductor substrate is reversed and is affixed to a base wafer such as a glass substrate with the use of, for example, heat-resistant waxes, and the substrate is subjected to dry etching or wet etching from the back side of the substrate on which no semiconductor device is formed to thereby form viaholes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the aforementioned process cannot significantly use highly selective dry etching masks such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>films or metal masks that are allowed to adhere to the substrate by treatment at elevated temperatures, since waxes used to affix the thinned substrate in this process are softened during processing of the viaholes at such elevated temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the process can only use mask materials such as negative type thick layer photoresists. However, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> schematically illustrating a cross section of a formed viahole, these mask materials exhibit low selectivity with respect to a semiconductor material <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and cannot significantly be controlled in viahole dimension due to regression <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a mask <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to thereby fail to form a fine viahole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, the resist mask <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is regressed during the dry etching process, and the regression <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the resist mask <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> affects a side wall to be processed to thereby invite a rough surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the side wall. Such a rough side wall may decrease the coverage of a metal during the subsequent metal plating process. A demand has therefore been made on a highly selective mask material that can form a mask at low temperatures and can yield, by etching, a viahole-region having a smooth side wall as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, exhibiting high anisotropy and having a good sectional shape. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to solve the problems of the conventional technologies and to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, which method can form fine viaholes in high yields and can thereby produce a high-performance superhigh-frequency semiconductor device by the use of a mask material that has high dry etching resistance and can form a mask at low temperatures in a process for forming viaholes of a semiconductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the present invention provides, in a first aspect, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device. The method includes the steps of forming at least an active device on a principal surface of a semiconductor substrate; etching the semiconductor substrate to thereby form a viahole adjacent to an active region where the active device is formed; and forming a plated wiring, which plated wiring includes the inner wall of the viahole and extends to an electrode of the active device on the surface of the substrate. In this method, a photo sensitive polyimide material is used as an etching mask in the step of forming a viahole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the above method, the step of forming a viahole may include the step of etching the semiconductor substrate from the surface of the substrate on which the active device is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the step of forming a viahole may include the step of etching the semiconductor substrate from the back side of the substrate opposite to the surface on which the active device is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the present invention provides another method of manufacturing a semiconductor device. The method includes the steps of forming at least an active device on a principal surface of a semiconductor substrate; etching the semiconductor substrate with the use of a photo sensitive polyimide material as an etching mask from the surface of the substrate on which the active device is formed to thereby form a viahole adjacent to an active region where the active device is formed; forming a plated wiring, which plated wiring includes the inner wall of the viahole and extends to an electrode of the active device on the surface of the substrate; reversing the substrate and temporarily fixing the reversed substrate on a base wafer with an adhesive; grinding or polishing the back side of the semiconductor substrate temporarily fixed on the base wafer to thereby thin the substrate; subjecting the thinned substrate to wet etching to thereby make the plated wiring at the inside bottom of the viahole open; and separating the semiconductor substrate carrying the viahole from the base wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the above methods according to the first and second aspects, the semiconductor substrate may be a substrate including a multi-layer epitaxial film of III-V compound semiconductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, the present invention provides another method of manufacturing a semiconductor device. This method includes the steps of forming at least an active device on a principal surface of a semiconductor substrate; etching the semiconductor substrate with the use of a photo sensitive polyimide material as an etching mask from the surface of the substrate on which the active device is formed to thereby form a viahole adjacent to an active region where the active device is formed; forming a plated wiring, which plated wiring includes the inner wall of the viahole and extends to an electrode of the active device on the surface of the substrate; reversing the substrate and temporarily fixing the reversed substrate on a base wafer with an adhesive; grinding or polishing the back side of the semiconductor substrate temporarily fixed on the base wafer to thereby thin the substrate; etching the thinned substrate with the use of a photo sensitive polyimide material as an etching mask in a region to be a viahole and a region directly underneath the active device on the surface of the substrate from the back side of the substrate to make the plated wiring at the inside bottom of the viahole open to thereby form a viahole structure and a heat-sink structure in one process step; plating a metal on overall of the back side of the substrate to thereby form a plated metal layer; and separating the semiconductor substrate carrying the viahole from the base wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a method of forming a viahole. The method includes the steps of forming a pilot hole having a depth of about several micrometers to ten micrometers with an accuracy of from 0.01 micrometer to several micrometers in a region to be a viahole from its surface using a very highly selective silicon oxide film or metal mask; reversing the substrate and thinning the reversed substrate from its back side to a finishing thickness of the substrate; etching the thinned substrate from the back side thereof according to the method of the first aspect of the present invention to thereby form a deep hole having a diameter of opening space larger than that of the pilot hole; and thus connecting the deep hole and the pilot hole with each other to thereby form a viahole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a technique in which viaholes are formed according to the method of the first or second aspect of the invention, the formed viaholes are covered with or filled with a metal by vapor deposition, metal plating or another technique and are then molded or sealed with the photo sensitive polyimide material in all or necessary portions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a field effect transistor manufactured by the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention and to a semiconductor high-frequency circuit using the field effect transistor. In these devices, source electrodes are formed in a position adjacent to a multi-fingered electrode, and viaholes 1 to 20 &mgr;m wide are formed directly underneath and adjacent to the source electrodes in order to ground from the back side of a semiconductor substrate. In this configuration, each of the viaholes corresponds to each finger of the multi-fingered electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition and advantageously, the present invention relates to a bipolar transistor, a hetero-junction bipolar transistor and semiconductor high-frequency circuits using these transistors. In these devices, viaholes 1 to 20 &mgr;m wide are formed outside the isolation boundary of the transistor. Each of the viaholes corresponds to each of emitter electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A feature of the present invention to achieve the above objects is the use of a photo sensitive polyimide material as an etching mask in the formation of viaholes by dry etching. When the photo sensitive polyimide material is cured, it exhibits stable properties near to those of glass, has satisfactory resistance to dry etching and can yield a film having a controlled and uniform thickness by spin coating as in conventional photoresists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is also advantageous that the photo sensitive polyimide material can form a thick layer about 10 to 40 &mgr;m thick in one process step in contrast to SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, while the resulting thickness depends on the viscosity of the photo sensitive polyimide material. In addition, the etching mask using the material can form patterns using an exposure system as in the conventional photoresists and can thereby simplify the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, when viaholes are formed on a GaAs substrate from the surface thereof, a possible candidate as a mask is, for example, a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask that is formed by conventional atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or plasma CVD and has satisfactory etching resistance. However, while depending on its selectivity, such a mask for use herein must have a thickness of at least 5 &mgr;m in order to form a hole about 80 &mgr;m deep, and such a thick mask cannot commercially be manufactured in volume by conventional CVD processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When viaholes are formed after the formation of high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hetero-junction bipolar transistors (HBTs), metal semiconductor field emission transistors (MESFETs) and other devices and circuits thereof on a principal surface of a compound semiconductor substrate, these devices and circuits undergo high temperatures of equal to or more than 300&deg; C. or plasma induced damage during the formation of the viaholes. This technique therefore lacks practicability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the conventional CVD processes, an etching mask is obtained after the formation of a resist mask and subsequent dry etching. In contrast, the use of the photo sensitive polyimide material according to the present invention as an etching mask can yield an etching mask by a single photo-etching process, and the resulting etching mask obtained in one process step can have a film thickness of about 10 to 40 &mgr;m and exhibits a significantly high throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The resulting photo sensitive polyimide mask can be cured at relatively low temperatures of from about 200&deg; C. to about 250&deg; C. after exposure and development. The cured polyimide material exhibits a high selectivity of equal to or more than 20 to dry etching and can thereby yield viaholes with significantly good shapes as compared with the use of conventional thick layer photoresists each having a selectivity of from about 3 to about 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the method of forming a viahole using a conventional resist mask, the target viahole has a design diameter of opening space of 40 &mgr;m&phgr; but exhibits an enlarged finish diameter of opening space of about 80 &mgr;m&phgr; due to the regression of the mask during the formation of the viahole 80 &mgr;m deep. However, by using the highly selective polyimide mask according to the present invention, a viahole having a diameter of opening space close to the design diameter thereof can be obtained without significant enlargement of the diameter of opening space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This means that the combination of the technique according to the present invention with the technique for the formation of a viahole from the surface of the semiconductor substrate can yield a fine viahole having a diameter of about 0.5 to 1.0 &mgr;m&phgr; which cannot be formed by the conventional methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After the formation of a viahole according to the above method, at least the inner wall of the formed viahole is covered with a metal by, for example, plating. The side wall in the formed viahole is very smooth to thereby ensure easy coverage and a sufficient thickness of the metal in the subsequent metal plating process and to improve reliability of the resulting viahole. This is because the photo sensitive polyimide material according to the present invention can yield a viahole exhibiting a high selectivity with minimized roughness of the side wall, which roughness occurs when the conventional mask materials having a low selectivity are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The viahole is then subjected to the metal plating process and a subsequent patterning process by etching for the formation of wiring. The reliability of the resulting viahole can further be improved by filling and molding (sealing) necessary portions of the patterned viahole with the photo sensitive polyimide material according to the present invention. In this procedure, the photo sensitive polyimide material does not significantly affect the high frequency properties of the product device, since it has a sufficiently low dielectric constant of about 2 to 3 at a frequency of 1 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Next, the GaAs substrate carrying the semiconductor devices on its principal surface is reversed and is then affixed to a base wafer such as glass wafer with the use of a wax, the back side of the substrate on which no semiconductor device is formed is thinned by etching or grinding to thereby make the bottom surface of the viahole open, which viahole carries the metal layer and is formed in the substrate. This procedure cannot use the masks that are formed by treatment at high temperatures, such as a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask, but can only use thick layer photoresists having a low selectivity, since the wax used is softened at such high temperature treatment. However, by using the photo sensitive polyimide material through post-exposure baking at 110&deg; C. for several minutes without curing, the viahole can highly selectively be processed as compared with the use of the conventional thick layer photoresists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> While the cured photo sensitive polyimide material exhibits a selectivity of about 20, the photo sensitive polyimide material which has been post-exposure baked without curing exhibits a somewhat low selectivity of about 10 but can yield a viahole having a good shape as compared with the use of the conventional photoresists each having a selectivity of from 3 to 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, the viahole formed by the use of the photoresists has a thick polymer layer on its side wall and invites some troubles. However, the use of the photo sensitive polyimide material does not invite such troubles and can form a viahole having a smooth surface with a profile having a high aspect ratio.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be illustrated in further detail with reference to several embodiments and attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>G are sectional views illustrating a manufacturing process of an MMIC as an embodiment of the present invention. In this process, viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed from the surface of a semi-insulating GaAs substrate carrying semiconductor devices previously formed thereon. In this process, the present invention is applied to manufacture of the MMIC mainly comprising a metamorphic HEMT device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Initially, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, plural main device units <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of MMIC are formed on a GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are then covered with a passivation film or a polyimide resin, followed by formation of a mask pattern having openings only in regions on which viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will be formed according to a conventional patterning process. The method of present invention uses a photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the formation process of the mask pattern and can concurrently yield an etching mask for the formation of the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the passivation film for the MMIC circuit in one process step. It can thereby significantly reduce the number of process steps. The photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> used herein is a negative type photo sensitive polyimide material having a viscosity of 8&plusmn;0.5 Pa&middot;s (25&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the main device units <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> have been formed in advance, but the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be formed in advance of the main device units <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without problems. The time of the formation of the devices is not specifically limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can yield a thick film about 10 to about 20 &mgr;m thick in one process step. After curing at 200&deg; C. to 250&deg; C., the resulting photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a thickness of about 6 to about 12 &mgr;m, i.e. about half the initial thickness. However, the mask can sufficiently be resistant to dry etching process for the formation of viaholes 80 &mgr;m or more deep on the GaAs substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed by dry etching using the photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The dry etching process can be performed, for example, by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) etching under the following conditions: Microwave power: 400 W, power density of RF bias of 13.56 MHz: 0.3 kW/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, etchant: SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and etching pressure: 2.0 mTorr. In this procedure, the photo sensitive polyimide mask used herein shows a high selectivity to GaAs of 20. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the photo sensitive polyimide mask for use in the present invention has a selectivity 4 to 7 times higher than the selectivity of conventional acrylic acid resin negative type thick layer resists, from 3 to 5. As described above, the methods of forming viaholes using conventional negative type resists as masks cannot avoid rough side walls of the resulting viaholes due to the regression of the resists during dry etching. However, the method of the present invention using the photo sensitive polyimide material as a mask can prevent rough side walls of the viaholes, and the resulting viaholes have smooth side walls and exhibit anisotropy in their shapes. Thus, the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a diameter of opening space of 5 &mgr;m&times;50 &mgr;m and a depth of 80 &mgr;m can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to the conventional methods, the rough side walls of the viaholes invite a decreased thickness of a gold coating <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed in a subsequent gold plating process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. To avoid this problem, the methods require a smoothing treatment by wet etching. However, the method of the present invention does not require the smoothing treatment and can significantly shorten the process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, after the formation of the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by dry etching, the photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed by treatment with an aqueous ammonia in a concentration of about 1% by weight for about 3 minutes. The viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are then subjected to washing and then to base metal coating by vapor deposition. In this embodiment, a Mo/Au thin deposited film with a thickness of 20 nm/800 nm is formed. The viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are then subjected to a gold plating process to thereby form a gold wiring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extending from inside the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the vicinity of the MMIC devices on the surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can yield the gold plated viaholes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each having a side wall with a smoothly formed surface. The gold plating formed herein has a thickness of at least 5 &mgr;m even in the thin-most side wall in the vicinity of the bottom of the viahole. The method can thereby exhibit a yield 50% or more higher than that of methods using the conventional resists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, after the gold plating process, the viaholes are filled with and the surface of the substrate is covered with the photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; to thereby protect the inside of the viaholes and the wiring by the photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (wafer) is reversed and is placed on a base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of, for example, glass or sapphire. The surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which the devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed is affixed to the base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> using a heat-resistant wax <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (a proof wax with a softening point of 150&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thinned 50 to 100 &mgr;m from its back side in the following manner. Specifically, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sequentially subjected to mechanical grinding with diamond particles, polishing and wet etching about 10 &mgr;m deep with a sulfuric acid etchant (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&equals;1:8:8) to remove warpage. In this procedure, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be thinned from its back side to such a thickness (depth) that the viaholes are completely open (completely through-out). Alternatively, the thinning operation is stopped immediately before the viaholes are completely open, the mask is then formed, and the substrate is etched to thereby allow the viaholes to penetrate the substrate. In any cases, by filling the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; immediately before thinning of the substrate, irregular or abnormal etching and thinning can be prevented to thereby improve reliability of the resulting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>F, the overall back side of the substrate is covered with a base metal coating (Ho/Au thin deposited film) and is then plated with gold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; to connect with the viaholes to thereby yield an MMIC. Ultimately, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; carrying the MMIC is separated from the base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and thereby yields the target MMIC mainly comprising the metamorphic HEMT device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can form viaholes in a yield 50% or more higher, a layout tolerance significantly higher and a reduced area of the resulting chip 50% or more smaller than the methods using the conventional negative type thick layer resists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> According to the method of the present invention, the diameters of the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be reduced from 40 to 60 &mgr;m&phgr; in conventional equivalents to 5 &mgr;m&times;50 &mgr;m or less. By effectively arranging these fine viaholes, the high frequency properties of the resulting device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When a module including a viahole having a design dimension of 5 &mgr;m&times;50 &mgr;m per four to eight devices is actually prepared, the resulting module exhibits a high frequency gain 3 dBm or more higher than those of conventional equivalents at 77 GHz. These advantages can also be obtained on MMICs mainly comprising GaAs HEMTs and MESFETs using semi-insulating GaAs substrates as in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With reference to a process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, surface viaholes of an MMIC mainly comprising a metamorphic HEMT device are formed. Initially, devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> about 1 &mgr;m thick is then formed according to a conventional procedure such as photolithography in combination with dry etching using a resist mask <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, pilot holes having a depth of about several micrometers to twenty micrometers and a width of from about 0.1 to about 20 &mgr;m are formed according to the dry etching process as in First Embodiment with high precision of an alignment accuracy of &plusmn;0.01 &mgr;m or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, wiring is formed by application of base metals and plating, the resulting substrate is reversed and is affixed to a base wafer such as a sapphire or glass wafer using a heat-resistant wax, and the semiconductor substrate is then thinned to a thickness ranging from about 30 to about 80 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate is then etched from its back side by the dry etching process mentioned above using the photo sensitive polyimide material as an etching mask to thereby form viaholes each having a diameter larger than that of the pilot holes. The depth of etching in this procedure is a depth obtained by subtracting the depth of the pilot holes from the thickness of the substrate. By this process, very fine viaholes having a design dimension of, for example, 1 &mgr;m&times;50 &mgr;m or less can be formed with high accuracy. Such fine viaholes cannot be obtained by conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This method enables the formation of viaholes on every finger of the multi-fingered electrode, can significantly avoid increase in inductance due to conventional wiring or routing and can further improve the high frequency gain 3 dBm or more at 77 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E are sectional views illustrating a method of forming backside viaholes as another embodiment of the present invention. In this method, the process of forming viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the back side of a semi-insulating GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applied to manufacture of an MMIC mainly comprising a metamorphic HEMT device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, main parts <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the MMIC, i.e. HEMT devices, and circuits thereof are previously formed on the surface of the GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, wiring is formed to make contact with viaholes, and the overall surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then covered with a passivation film or a polyimide resin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;. The substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is reversed and is affixed to a base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of, for example, glass or sapphire using a wax <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a softening point lower than that of the wax used in First Embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thinned from its back side to a thickness of about 50 to 100 &mgr;m in the same manner as in First Embodiment. A film of a photo sensitive polyimide material is formed on the thinned substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> in First Embodiment to thereby yield a mask pattern <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed by dry etching to such an extent that the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> penetrate the GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The polyimide resin mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> cannot be subjected to curing in contrast to that in First Embodiment, since the bonding wax <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a low softening point is used in this embodiment. However, the polyimide resin mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> used herein has a sufficient thickness of from 10 to 20 &mgr;m and can satisfactorily be used in practice without problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be formed dry etching such as electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) etching under the following conditions: Microwave power: 400 W, power density of RF bias of 13.56 MHz: 0.3 kW/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, etchant: SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and etching pressure: 1.0 mTorr. The selectivity to the GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in this procedure is as high as about 10. This selectivity is 2 to 3 times larger than that of the conventional thick layer negative type resists, i.e., from 3 to 5. This configuration can yield viaholes having smooth and satisfactory shapes with less roughness of the side walls. Accordingly, a satisfactory gold plated film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 5 to 10 &mgr;m can be formed in coating of base metals (Mo/Au deposited film) and in gold plating process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>. The viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are then filled with a photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; in the same manner as in First Embodiment. The filling operation may be omitted in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>E, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> carrying the MMIC is separated from the base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to thereby yield the target MMIC mainly comprising the metamorphic HEMT device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> According to the conventional methods using negative type thick layer resists, the side walls of the resulting viaholes are roughened due to regression of the resists or by action of a polymer layer formed on the side walls upon dry etching. The resulting gold plated film has a decreased thickness to thereby decrease yields and reliability of the resulting devices. In contrast, the method of the present invention can improve both the yield and reliability 20% to 30% higher than the conventional methods and can thereby reduce a production cost about 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The method according to the present embodiment employs a diameter of opening space of the viaholes of 40 &mgr;m&phgr; as a standard but the method can produce viaholes having a larger aspect ratio due to improved selectivity of the mask, can improve a layout tolerance as compared with the conventional methods. Thus, very satisfactory advantages can also be obtained in mask design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> These advantages can also be obtained on MMICs mainly comprising GaAs HEMTs and MESFETs using semi-insulating GaAs substrates as in this embodiment. </paragraph>

This process is basically similar to the process of First Embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>G, except that the material for the substrate is different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, main devices <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the MMIC and circuits thereof are formed on the surface of an InP substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, followed by coverage of the surface with a passivation film. In this process step, the photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used as the passivation film, is exposed using an exposure system and is developed. The resulting covering layer can be used as a mask for the formation of viaholes. To glassify the photo sensitive polyimide material, the film of the photo sensitive polyimide material is cured at 200&deg; C. However, the photo sensitive polyimide material can be cured at relatively low temperatures and can therefore yield a mask having satisfactory etching resistance without damaging AlAs channels that are susceptible to impurities and diffusion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Using the photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a depth of 50 &mgr;m are formed by dry etching, for example, using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) dry etching system under the following conditions: Antenna output: 400 W, RF bias: 100 W, etchant: Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gaseous mixture, and etching pressure: 1.0 mTorr. In this procedure, the photo sensitive polyimide mask exhibits a selectivity to InP as high as about 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The conventional thick layer resists have a low selectivity of about 1 to 2 and are not suitable for micromachining of such devices. In contrast, the method of the present invention can form patterns having a diameter of opening space of 5 &mgr;m&phgr; or more without problems. The viaholes formed by the method of the invention have substantially smooth side walls with less roughness after dry etching. Thus, a gold plated layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed in the subsequent process step can have a sufficient thickness and the resulting device can therefore have a satisfactory yield and reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carrying the gold plated layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the inner walls thereof is then filled and fixed with the photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; according to the invention. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the substrate is then reversed and is affixed to a base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of, for example glass or sapphire using a heat-resistant wax <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> With reference to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; is thinned from its back side to a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m. A mask is then formed from the back side of the substrate using a photo sensitive polyimide material or resist, and the InP substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; is etched by dry etching and wet etching to thereby make the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> open which are previously formed from the surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The overall face of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; is then plated with gold to thereby form a gold plated film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference>. In this process step, the viaholes are allowed to penetrate the substrate by etching from the back side of the substrate. Alternatively, the viaholes can be allowed to penetrate the substrate in the following manner when the formed viaholes have an accurately controlled depth of 50 &mgr;m with satisfactory uniformity. Specifically, the substrate is thinned to such a depth immediately before the viaholes penetrate the substrate, and the overall back side of the InP substrate is then wet-etched to thereby allow the viaholes to penetrate the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the latter process, the overall face of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; is then plated with gold to thereby form the gold plated film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Ultimately, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>F, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; carrying the MMIC is separated from the base wafer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and thereby yields the target MMIC <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mainly comprising the InP HEMT device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Such InP HEMTs liberate large quantity of heat, and the formation of viaholes is an important issue to ensure satisfactory reliability of the devices. However, InP is etched at a low rate, and satisfactory mask materials for etching of InP have not been found. The method of present invention using the photo sensitive polyimide material that has high selectivity and can easily be patterned as the mask dramatically improves a process throughput. The gold plated layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</cross-reference> can be used as a heat-sink, and the resulting device can satisfactorily dissipate heat and can exhibit sufficient reliability in practice. </paragraph>

With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, HBT devices and circuits thereof are previously formed on the surface of a GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in regions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on which the MMIC will be formed. A patterned photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a thickness of from 1 to 2 &mgr;m is then formed from the surface of the substrate, and viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed using the photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a mask in the same manner as in the process steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> in First Embodiment. By this procedure, the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed from the surface of the substrate using the highly selective mask, and the resulting viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> thereby have a depth of 10 &mgr;m and a diameter of opening space of 10 &mgr;m&phgr; with high alignment accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> gold wiring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is applied into the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by gold plating process, and regions where the viaholes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed are then molded or sealed with the photo sensitive polyimide material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; to improve the reliability of the resulting devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In such HBT devices, an emitter current increases with an elevating temperature, and the increased emitter current further increases the temperature, thus inviting &ldquo;thermal runaway&rdquo; in many cases. As a countermeasure to this problem, the substrate immediately underneath the devices is thinned as much as possible, and the thinned regions of the substrate are then coated with a metal to thereby yield a heat-sink structure which can dissipate heat. A method of forming the viaholes and heat-sink structure will be described below. </paragraph>

The substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then thinned to a thickness of from 30 to 50 &mgr;m by grinding or polishing to yield a thinned substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;. A photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the invention is then formed on the substrate from its back side using a double-side contact aligner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>E, the mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is then removed, the overall back side of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; is plated with gold and thereby yields gold-plated viahole regions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and heat-sink regions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in one process step. In the present embodiment, the substrate has a thickness of 50 &mgr;m in general and a thickness of 10 &mgr;m in the heat-sink regions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In this case, the depth of thinning of the substrate in the heat-sink regions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> from the back side is 40 &mgr;m or more, and such a thinning procedure can be achieved first by the use of the highly selective photo sensitive polyimide mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. </paragraph>

The process can also improve the high frequency properties of the resulting device and can significantly minimize increase in operating temperature and thereby avoid thermal runaway that constitutes a problem of the HBT device.

The present embodiment is illustrated by taking an MMIC module mainly comprising a GaAs HBT as an example. The same advantages can also be obtained upon MMICs using InP HBTs and the collector-up HBTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Sixth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a plan view showing a layout of a device as an embodiment of the present invention, in which the process of forming viaholes according to the present invention is applied to a high frequency semiconductor module mainly comprising a compound semiconductor field effect transistor such as an MESFET or HEMT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In this device, an amplifier circuit having a multi-fingered electrode (a gate electrode) structure <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of a semi-insulating GaAs semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. A wiring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to be a signal conductor is arranged, and ground viaholes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> penetrating the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> from its surface to its back side are formed. A drain electrode <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the multi-fingered electrode structure <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is connected to the wiring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to be a signal conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> According to the conventional methods, a single viahole is arranged outside an active circuit, the surface of a substrate is covered with, for example, an interlayer passivation film, and the device is connected by a multilayer wiring technique. In contrast, according to the present invention, the ground viaholes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are formed in the regions of source electrodes <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to thereby directly ground to the back side of the substrate, and each of the ground viaholes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is arranged corresponding to each of fingers of the multi-fingered electrode (gate electrode) <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. This configuration can suppress increase in inductance due to wiring or routing and can significantly improve the high frequency properties of the resulting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The conventional methods, in which viaholes are formed from the backside of the substrate, exhibit an alignment accuracy of a contact aligner of at most &plusmn;1 &mgr;m. When the conventional resist masks each having a low selectivity are used, the pattern transfer accuracy in viahole formation is about &plusmn;30 &mgr;m. These conventional techniques exhibit very low alignment accuracy in viahole formation and cannot be applied to the module which requires an alignment accuracy of at least &plusmn;0.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the viaholes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be formed from the surface of the substrate by the process according to the present invention. Specifically, each of electrodes and wiring is formed by photolithography using electron beam (EB) exposure or an i-line stepper, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask about 1 &mgr;m thick is then formed by i-line lithography and dry etching, and the viaholes are formed from the surface of the substrate to a depth of about 10 &mgr;m using the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask. By using the highly selective SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask and the highly accurate i-line lithography, the resulting viaholes have an alignment accuracy controlled within a range of &plusmn;0.1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Next, wiring is formed by coating the inside of the viaholes with base metals such as an Mo/Au deposited film and plating the coated viaholes with gold. The substrate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is then reversed and is thinned to a thickness of about 80 &mgr;m, and the thinned substrate is dry-etched using the photo sensitive polyimide mask according to the invention to a depth of about 70 &mgr;m to thereby allow the viaholes to penetrate the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The substrate is then coated with base metals and is plated with gold from its back side, a ground wiring is formed to yield the target device. The backside viaholes are formed for grounding and may have diameters sufficiently larger than those of the surface viaholes in consideration of the alignment accuracy and other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In this connection, when a module including viaholes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having a surface design dimension of 2 &mgr;m&times;50 &mgr;m (a backside dimension of 3 &mgr;m&times;55 &mgr;m) corresponding to individual fingers of the multi-fingered electrode is formed, the resulting module exhibits a high frequency gain at 77 GHz 5 dBm or more higher than that of a module formed by the conventional technique in which a single viahole (a design dimension of 40 &mgr;m&times;40 &mgr;m) is formed outside a circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Naturally, the method of the present invention can yield very fine viaholes having a design dimension of 1 &mgr;m&times;20 &mgr;m or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The same advantages can be obtained in HBT devices and modules mainly comprising the HBT devices. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a plan view schematically illustrating a layout of a module to which the present invention is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> According the conventional techniques, such a module is formed by a process in which a single ground viahole having a design dimension of 50 &mgr;m&times;50 &mgr;m is arranged outside the circuit, and four to ten HBT devices as a single unit are connected to an emitter electrode. In contrast, according to the present invention, ground viaholes having a design dimension of 2 &mgr;m&times;10 &mgr;m are formed, each of which ground viaholes corresponds to each of the emitter electrodes. The resulting device can significantly minimize increase in inductance due to wiring, can satisfactorily dissipate heat and exhibits an output power at a frequency of 2.5 GHz 5 dBm or more higher than that of conventional equivalents. In addition, the resulting device has a significantly prolonged life (reliability) of 20000 hours or more as determined by an accelerating test in comparison with that of the conventional equivalents, 1000 hours. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a ground viahole <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, an emitter electrode wiring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, an emitter electrode <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, a collector electrode <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, a device isolation boundary <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, a base electrode <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a base electrode wiring <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, and a collector electrode wiring <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As thus described above, the present invention uses the mask material that is highly resistant to dry etching and can yield a mask at low temperatures in the formation of viaholes in semiconductor devices. The invention can therefore provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, which method can form fine viaholes in high yields and can produce high-performance superhigh-frequency semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the sprit and scope of the appended claims.
