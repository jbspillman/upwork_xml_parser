<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Within the scope of a load reduction method of automatic transmissions or clutches of a motor vehicle during emergency program shifting operations, an engine torque reduction is carried out during the emergency program shifting operation from a normal shifting program to an emergency program (NP). </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a load reducing method for automatic transmissions during emergency program shifting operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the case of an operating error or failure of the transmission, emergency program shifting operations are carried out in order to change over the transmission to fail-safe state in which further travel with emergency running properties is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Vehicles with high powered motorization and particularly shifting elements thereof become-considerably loaded during an emergency shifting operation. The clutches concerned thus reach their load limits already after a few emergency program shifting operations under full load at high rotational speed of the engine, and this negatively affects the service life and accordingly the durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Constructional measures, such as enlargement of the clutch or increase of the number of discs for reducing the thermal load of the clutch that generates, are not adequate due to the installation space required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An optimization of the lubrication or cooling or an increase in the amount of lubricant would not completely solve the problem. Besides, such a procedure would negatively affect the lubrication conditions in the rear-mounted unit of the transmission. In addition an extensive permanent testing would be needed on the test bench, which is associated with considerable expense and is time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the above reasons, the use of thermally stabler clutch linings also is not the optimum solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The problem on which this invention is based is to indicate a method for load reduction of transmissions or clutches during emergency program shifting operations, which method can be economically and reliably applied without further mechanical constructional measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This problem is solved by the features stated in the characteristic part of claim 1. Other developments and variations result from the sub-claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is proposed to obtain a direct reduction of the clutch load during emergency shifting operations by reducing the engine torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The engine torque can be implemented both in an electrical and in a mechanical emergency running during emergency program shifting operations provided by the inventive method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In an electrical emergency running which, according to the prior art, is triggered by diagnostic functions, there have hitherto been disconnected only the outputs of the electronic transmission control (EGS) which concern the hydraulic actuators such as magnetic valves and pressure regulators, the electronic transmission control being further activated. The emergency program shifting operation then takes place strictly hydraulically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, it is, on the contrary, provided to implement an engine torque reduction by a corresponding requirement of the electronic transmission control or a standard about the controller area network bus (CAN-BUS) on the engine control. The engine engagement or the engine torque reduction is carried out via functions already existing in the engine control, such as firing angle adjustment within the scope of an engine engagement and/or injection scattering in the engine control during the time of the emergency program shifting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Within the scope of a variant of the invention, it is proposed to carry out the engine torque reduction according to functionality requirements and comfort considerations depending on the operating conditions at the moment of the emergency program shifting operation. Such operating conditions can be, for example, the gear introduced, load and rotational speed of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the case of a mechanical transmission emergency running (EGS-not operative) and/or a CAN bus interruption, the reduction of the engine torque is carried out during the emergency program shifting operation via an additional functionality in the engine control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The torque load of the transmission, during emergency program shifting operations, can be immediately and significantly reduced by the above described method. The clutches can thus be protected and a longer duration is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The method further proves to be economical and simple inasmuch as very expensive and lengthy mechanical optimizations are not needed.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For the case of an electrical emergency running the inventive method functions as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The occurrence of an error is diagnosed and detected at the moment t_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the electronic transmission control and then the emergency program NP is activated, as can be seen from the above diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which shows a state time diagram of the emergency program shifting operation. According to the invention, at the moment-t_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> an engine engagement ME is also introduced in order to reduce the engine torque T_mot. This is illustrated in the rotational speed time diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (second diagram from top): the engine rotational speed n_mot is reduced beginning at t _<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in direction to the synchronization point of the emergency program speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the clutch pressure time diagram from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the shifting clutches concerned are, at the same time, hydraulically activated (disconnecting clutch shown in dotted line, engaging clutch in solid line). The bottom diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a state time diagram for the engine engagement ME; the state <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to an activation of the engine engagement ME and is effected at a moment t_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The intensity of the engine engagement ME is here function of the operating conditions at the moment t_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the emergency program shifting operation, preferably of the engine rotational speed n_mot and/or of the shifting interval and/or of the engine torque T_mot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The electronic transmission control delivers the nominal value standard for the engine torque T_mot and a time duration t_ME for the engine engagement ME which is triggered during the emergency program shifting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The synchronization point of the emergency program sequence is reached at the moment t_<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the engine rotational speed n_mot (rotational speed time diagram) reaching here a minimum value in order subsequently to rise again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> At the moment t_<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the main pressure on the emergency gear clutch is reached (see the clutch pressure time diagram); the engine engagement ME is then terminated at the moment t_<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;ME&equals;0&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is shown a block gear shift-diagram of the inventive method for the case of an emergency running during which the electronic or electrohydraulic control of the transmission still is operative and likewise the communication of the electronic transmission control unit to the electronic engine control unit is in variably intact. After activation of the emergency program NP by the electronic transmission control, the electrical emergency running is stated and the time period t_ME is established the same as the intensity of the engine engagement ME. In the next step, the engine torque T_mot is reduced, via the engine engagement ME, for the time period t_ME in order then to change over to the emergency running operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The sequence of the method for the case of a mechanical emergency running or of a failure of the CAN bus is made clear in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Contrary to the above described electrical emergency running, the functions are assumed by the electronic,engine control, since the electronic transmission control can no longer perform any functions: when the electronic transmission control (EGS) or the CAN bus are inoperative, that is, when the engine control receives no signals from the EGS, the emergency program NP is activated and the time period t_ME and intensity of the engine engagement ME as function of the operating parameters are determined by the electronic engine control. The engine torque T_mot is then reduced, via the engine engagement ME, for the time period t_ME and changed over to the emergency running operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The inventive method offers an active clutch protection combined with an increased shifting comfort and ensures a mechanical protection of the transmission during every shifting transition from normal operation with a normal shifting program to an emergency running program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the method is simple and can be implemented without added input variables or operands, it being possible to divide the implementation of the operation between the transmission control and the engine control.
