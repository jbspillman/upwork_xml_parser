<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a drive control apparatus for an injection molding machine, which apparatus drives and controls a servomotor for moving a movable member such as a movable platen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Relevant Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, there has been known a safety apparatus configured to stop operation of a servomotor for moving a movable member, such as a movable platen, of an injection molding machine when a safety door of the injection molding machine is opened (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 10 (1998)-296818). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, a safety apparatus of such a type operates as follows when used for a mold clamping apparatus. When a limit switch detects that a safety door is opened during movement of a movable platen toward a mold-closing direction, a detection signal that is output from the limit switch upon detection of the door being opened is fed to an over-travel terminal or zero clamp terminal of a servo circuit (servo amplifier) for driving and controlling a servomotor, to thereby quickly stop operation of the servomotor; i.e., movement of a movable platen (movable mold). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the above-described conventional safety apparatus is realized by making use of a servo circuit (drive control apparatus). In many cases, a main portion of the servo circuit is realized by means of a software circuit section in order to perform various sophisticated control and processing functions at high speed and to cope with changes in specifications and upgrading. Therefore, operation of the above-described safety apparatus is also realized by a control program (software) included in the software circuit section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although such a software circuit section realized by means of software has the advantages as described above, the software circuit section may operate erroneously as a result of, for example, external noise. In addition, such a software circuit section may involve program bugs and may cause the CPU to fall out of control. Therefore, only a certain extent of safety and reliability of an injection molding machine has been secured. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a drive control apparatus for an injection molding machine which is advantageously applied to a highly important functional section, such as a safety circuit section, of the injection molding machine in order to remarkably enhance safety and reliability of the injection molding machine, while maintaining merits attained through use of a software circuit section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a drive control apparatus for an injection molding machine which is advantageously applied to a safety circuit section, which is a highly important functional section, in order to realize stop control of high response, as well as reliable stop control by mean of a dual system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the objects as described above, the present invention provides a drive control apparatus used in an injection molding machine in order to drive and control a servomotor for moving a movable member, characterized in that among a plurality of functional sections which constitute a servo circuit connected to the servomotor, at least one functional section selected as a functional section having a higher degree of importance is constituted by a hardware circuit section realized without use of software; and the remaining functional section or sections are constituted by a software circuit section realized by making use of software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An example of the functional section having a higher degree of importance includes a safety circuit section which detects that a safety door is opened and subsequently stops operation of the servomotor. The safety circuit section includes an open/close switch connected in series to a signal line which supplies a drive control signal to a power diver for supplying electricity to the servomotor; and a logic circuit which outputs a stop command signal upon receipt of a detection signal generated when the safety door is opened, and changes over the open/close switch by means of the stop command signal. The safety circuit section may include a delay circuit for changing over the open/close switch upon elapse of a predetermined delay time after the logic circuit has output the stop command signal.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will next be described in detail with reference to the drawings. The accompanying drawings are illustrative of the embodiment and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention. In order to describe the invention clearly, detailed description of known features is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> First, the configuration of a drive control apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An injection molding machine M indicated by an imaginary line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes an injection apparatus Mi disposed on a machine base Mb, and a mold clamping apparatus Mc, to which a mold unit C is attached. The mold clamping apparatus Mc includes a drive mechanism which uses a servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for advancing and retracting a movable platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>(movable member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), to which a movable mold Cm of the mold unit C is attached. The mold clamping apparatus Mc is provided with a safety door D and a limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for detecting that the safety door D is opened. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the safety door D is shown in a closed state, and can be opened by being slid leftward in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The mold clamping apparatus Mc includes the drive control apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for driving and controlling the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The drive control apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a servo circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a rotary encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> attached to the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to detect rotation thereof, and the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are connected to the servo circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The servo circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constitutes a main portion of the present invention. In general, the servo circuits <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> consists of a plurality of functional sections <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>etc. The plurality of functional sections <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>etc. are classified in accordance with degree of importance. In the servo circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, a safety circuit section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>for detecting that the safety door D is opened and for stopping operation of the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is classified as a functional section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a higher degree of importance, and a servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is classified as a remaining functional section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is constituted by a software circuit section <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> realized by making use of software. The servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes a CPU, various types of memories, and other components, and stores a control program (software) therein. The servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a computer function for performing various types of control and processing on the basis of the computer program. Further, the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes a frequency dividing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The frequency dividing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a function of dividing two pulse signals; i.e., a phase A pulse signal Sa and a phase B pulse signal Sb, supplied from the rotary encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, respectively. Moreover, the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected to an unillustrated central controller. Command values and other data are supplied from the central controller to the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a power driver for supplying electricity to the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An AC power source is connected to the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a rectification section, a smoothing section, power transistors, and other components. The power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> via an open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which will be described later. The above configuration enables the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to supply a drive control signal Sc to the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the safety circuit section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>is constituted by a hardware circuit section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> realized without use of software. The hardware circuit section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes a logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; a rotational direction detection circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> connected to an input terminal of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; and a delay circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected to an output terminal of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a plurality of input terminals and a single output terminal. A stop command signal Ss is output from the output terminal in accordance with binary data supplied to the plurality of input terminals. In the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one contact of the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which enters an OFF state when the door D is opened, is connected to the input terminals of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the other contact of the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is grounded; i.e., is connected to a ground line (0 level). Therefore, when the safety door D is opened, a detection signal Sd (&ldquo;1&rdquo; signal) is input to the input terminals of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the drive control apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the mold clamping apparatus Mc is considered to be a portion of the servo amplifier, the two input terminals of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to which one contact of the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected, correspond to an overtravel terminal for preventing rotation in the regular direction (i.e., mold closing direction) and an over-travel terminal for preventing rotation in the reverse direction (i.e., mold opening direction), respectively. Further, a cancel circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to one of the two input terminals (over-travel terminal for preventing reverse rotation). By virtue of the above-described configuration, the detection signal Sd is supplied to the first input terminal (over-travel terminal for preventing reverse rotation) via the cancel circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and is supplied directly to the second input terminal (over-travel terminal for preventing regular rotation). Provision of the cancel circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> enables the following operation. When a semi-automatic override mode is selected, a mode selection signal Sx is supplied to the cancel circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to cause the cancel circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to cancel the detection signal Sd which is supplied to the first input terminal (over-travel terminal for preventing reverse rotation) upon detection that the safety door D is opened and to supply a &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal to the first input terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Frequency-divided signals Sao and Sbo are supplied to the rotational direction detection circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Since the phase A pulse signal Sa and the phase B pulse signal Sb output from the rotary encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are supplied to the frequency dividing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the rotational direction of the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be detected through composition between the frequency-divided signals Sao and Sbo output from the frequency dividing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A rotational direction detection signal So output from the rotational direction detection circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is supplied to a third input terminal of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The rotational direction detection signal So may be a single-line signal or a two-line signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The delay circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a function of switching the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upon elapse of a preset delay time Td after issuance of the stop command signal Ss from the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Specifically, in general, when the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives a stop control signal for stopping operation of the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> stops supply of electricity to the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and simultaneously supplies to a brake resistor electromotive force generated by the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is rotating by means of inertia, to thereby brake the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> electromagnetically. However, when the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is brought into the OFF state by means of the stop command signal Ss, the connection between the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the brake resistor, which constitute a brake circuit (dynamic brake), is broken, so that the brake circuit is disabled. In view of the foregoing, through provision of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, after the brake circuit has operated over a certain period of time; i.e., after elapse of the delay time Td, the stop command signal Ss is supplied to the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order to bring the switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the OFF state. Accordingly, the detection signal Sd output from the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is supplied not only to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> but also to the central controller, so that the command value supplied to the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is changed to an emergency command value of 0 level. Thus, stop control of high response, as well as reliable stop control by means of a dual system, can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As described above the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected in series to the signal line L. When the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is brought into an ON state, the signal line L between the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> enters an connected state, so that the drive control signal Sc is supplied to the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is brought into an OFF state, the signal line L between the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> enters a cutoff state, so that supply of electricity to the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be stopped without stopping the supply of electricity to the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Next, operation of the drive control apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment; in particular, operation of the mold clamping apparatus Mc shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, will be described in accordance with the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and with reference to the truth table shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> We assume that the injection molding machine M has been set to a manual mode. When an unillustrated start switch is turned on, mold closing operation and then mold clamping operation are performed in accordance with the control program (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, when the safety door D is not opened, the drive control signal Sc, which is output from the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the basis of a command value and the output of the rotary encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, is supplied to the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thus, feedback control is performed for the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, whereby the mold closing operation and the mold clamping operation are performed in accordance with the command value (steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, we assume that the safety door D is opened when the mold closing operation or the mold clamping operation proceeds. When the safety door D is opened, the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enters the OFF state (steps S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). As a result, the detection signal Sd is supplied to the input terminals of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). In the present embodiment, when the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enters the OFF state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo; is supplied to the two input terminals of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> corresponding to the over-travel terminal for prohibiting regular rotation and the over-travel terminal for prohibiting reverse rotation, respectively, as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The rotational direction detection signal So (signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo;) output from the rotational direction detection circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is also supplied to the third input terminal of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. On the basis of these logic signals; i.e., the signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo; supplied to the over-travel terminal for prohibiting regular rotation and the rotational direction detection signal So (signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo;), the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> outputs a stop command signal Ss (signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo;) from its output terminal (step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). This stop command signal Ss is supplied to the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, whereby the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is switched to OFF (step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). As a result, the signal line L is broken, and the power driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> stops the operation of the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> At this time, as described above, the detection signal Sd output from the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is supplied not only to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and but also to the central controller; and the stop command signal Ss output from the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is delayed by a delay time Td by means of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the command value supplied to the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is first changed to an emergency command value so as to quickly step the servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of the brake circuit of the servo amplifier main section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is switched to OFF. Therefore, stop control of high response and reliable stop control by means of the dual system are realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiment, a mold clamping process in a manual mode has been described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, since the rotational direction detection signal So assumes the &ldquo;0&rdquo; level in a manual-mode mold opening process, the stop command signal Ss is output on the basis of the signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo; supplied to the over-travel terminal for prohibiting reverse rotation. The same operation as that performed in the above-described manual mode is performed in an automatic mode and a semi-automatic normal mode, as well. However, in a semi-automatic override mode, since a changeover signal Sx is supplied to the cancel circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the signal of level &ldquo;1&rdquo; is cancelled, and a signal of level &ldquo;0&rdquo; is supplied to the over-travel terminal for prohibiting reverse rotation during the mold opening process. As a result, during the mold opening operation in the semiautomatic override mode, even when the safety door D is opened, the open/close switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is maintained ON in order to permit manual mold opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The embodiment exemplifies the case in which the movable platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>of the mold clamping apparatus Mc serves as a movable member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention can be applied to an ejector pin (movable member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) provided in the mold unit C and a screw (movable member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) provided in an injection apparatus Mi. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>denotes a servo circuit for driving and controlling a servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>which moves the ejector pin provided in the mold unit C; <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>w </italic></highlight>denotes a servo circuit for driving and controlling a servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>w </italic></highlight>which rotates the screw provided in the injection apparatus Mi; and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>denotes a servo circuit for driving and controlling a servomotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>which reciprocates the screw. Like the above-described servo circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the servo circuits <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>w, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>are formed by hardware circuit sections <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>w, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>and software circuit sections <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>w, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i, </italic></highlight>respectively. Since the hardware circuit sections <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>w, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>do not require the above-described semi-automatic override mode, the number of input terminals of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for receiving the detection signal Sd from the limit switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is one. Although not shown in the drawings, the present invention can be applied similarly to a servo circuit which drives and controls a servomotor for moving a core (movable member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) provided in the mold unit C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the drive control apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment, the functional section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a higher degree of importance; i.e., the safety circuit section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s, </italic></highlight>is constituted by the hardware circuit section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> realized without use of software. Therefore, occurrence of erroneous operation due to external noise, program bugs, runaway of a CPU, and the like can be avoided, whereby safety and reliability are remarkably enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. Regarding structural details and methods among others, modifications and any omission or addition may be possible as needed without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the safety circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>that operates upon opening of the safety door D has been exemplified as a functional section having a higher degree of importance. However, the functional section having a higher degree of importance may be a safety circuit section having a different configuration, or a circuit other than the safety circuit. Further, a plurality of functional sections <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be determined to have a higher degree of importance. Moreover, provision of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not always required. </paragraph>
