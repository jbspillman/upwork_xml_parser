<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a book rest, and in particular to a book rest having a foldable structure and being adjustable in viewing angle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Book rests are commonly used in retaining a book in a desired angular position for helping people, especially the disabled, to read the book. To meet the personal requirement of each particular user, the book rest is sometimes made adjustable in the angular position that it supports a book. An example is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,591. However, such a known adjustable book rest has a complicated structure and sometimes requires sophisticated operations. On the other hand, some of the known book rests have a simple structure and are easy to use. However, such book rests are not capable of adjustment of the angular position that they support a book for being suitable for different users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show two examples of the conventional book rests that have a simple structure. The book rest shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a main frame A and two side frames B extending from opposite sides of the main frame A. Each side frame B forms a recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for receiving a lower portion of a book (not shown) therein and an inclined book support arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending between the main frame A and the recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for supporting the book in a predetermined angular position. A projection C is formed on the side frame B and substantially parallel to the book support arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for retaining the book that is supported by the book support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in an open condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The book rest shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> comprises a main frame A and two side frames B extending from opposite sides of the main frame A for supporting the main frame A in a predetermined angular position. Two L-shaped members (not labeled) extend from the opposite sides of the main frame A and each forms a recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for receiving a lower portion of a book (not shown) and a projection C for retaining the book in an open condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Both designs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> allow the side frames B to be folded into the main frame A for reducing the overall size thereof in storage. However, these conventional designs do not allow a substantial adjustment of the angular position (such as 30-70 degrees) that a book is supported on the book rest. In addition, although the conventional designs of the book rest provide means for retaining the book in open condition, such means is not effective in retaining the pages of the book in a &ldquo;completely open&rdquo; condition for convenient reading by the reader. In other words, pages of the book may, due to resiliency thereof, partially resume closed condition and thus interfering with the eyesight of the reader. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a book rest having a simple structure while allowing effective adjustment of angular position that a book is supported thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a book rest having a page retention device for effectively retaining pages of a book that is supported on the book rest in a &ldquo;completely open&rdquo; condition for easy reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a book rest comprising a primary frame having bottom and top bars connected by opposite side bars for supporting a book thereon and a secondary frame pivoted to the side bars of the primary frame to be movable with respect to the primary frame between a folded position and an expanded position where an included angle is formed between the primary frame and the secondary frame for supporting the book at a corresponding angular position. A Velcro strip has first and second end sections on which hooks and loops are respectively formed. The first end of the Velcro strip is fixed to the bottom bar of the primary frame and the second end of the Velcro is folded over a bar of the secondary frame and overlaps the first end section to releasably fix the included angle between the primary and secondary frame whereby the angular position of the primary frame and thus that of the book supported on the book rest can be adjusted. The secondary frame can be moved into inside the primary frame for completely folding the book rest. Each side bar of the primary frame is provided with a page retention member that is biased by a spring to securely engage pages of a book supported on the book rest thereby effectively retaining the pages in the open condition.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, a book rest constructed in accordance with the present invention comprising a primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having two opposite sides between which a secondary, support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted whereby the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is movable between a folded condition (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>) and an expanded condition (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>) where the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> supports the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in any desired angular position with respect to a horizontal surface, such as a desk (not shown), by change an included angle &thgr; between the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> whereby a book (not shown) is supported by the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at a desired viewing angle for a reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated, the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is made of stiff wire in the form of a closed frame having a bottom bar <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and an opposite top bar <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> connected by two bent and substantially symmetric side bars <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate bar <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and two arms <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> extending from the elongate bar <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Each arm <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> forms an L-shaped free end <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> that is rotatably received in a pivot hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed in the corresponding side bar <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> of the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> whereby the elongate bar <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> of the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the bottom bar <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are engageable with on the desk for positioning the book rest on the desk. The pivot hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is defined by a tubular member extending from the side bar <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> of the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the embodiment illustrated. The rotatable engagement between the L-shaped free end <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of each arm <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> of the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the tubular member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the corresponding side bar <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> of the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> allows the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to rotate with respect to each other for changing the included angle &thgr; therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Also referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>F, an adjusting device <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is coupled between the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for releasably retaining the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at a particular included angle with respect to the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> thereby selectively fixing the angular position of the book supported by the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The adjusting device <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate member or a strip connected between the bottom bar <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a loop <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> formed on the elongate bar <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> of the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. By changing the length of the elongate member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> between the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the included angle &thgr; between the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is adjustable. In the embodiment illustrated, the elongate member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprises a Velcro&reg; strip having first and second end sections <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on which hook-type engaging elements <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>) and loop-type engaging elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</cross-reference>) are respectively formed. The second end of the strip <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is securely attached to the bottom bar <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while the first end section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the strip <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> extends through the loop <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and folded over and partially overlap the second end section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to have the loop-type and hook-type engaging elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> engaging each other, thereby fixing the length of the strip <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and thus the included angle &thgr; between the primary frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the support frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>.
