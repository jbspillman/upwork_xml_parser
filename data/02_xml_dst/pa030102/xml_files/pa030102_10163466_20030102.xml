<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Fresh meat products are processed into various cuts at the meat processing plant where they are then packaged prior to sending to the retail market. The packaging step includes placing the cuts of meat within a tray which is then over wrapped with a non-barrier clear plastic film. The over wrapped trays are then placed within a vacuum pack and gas-flushed barrier bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art to package fresh meat in a modified atmosphere environment whereby the packaging is flushed with a preservation-enhancing gas mixture such as carbon-dioxide. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,667,827 and 5,711,978 both issued to Breen et al., disclose a process of packaging fresh meat and a fresh meat packaging which provide an inexpensive, retail case-ready packaging for perishable products, such as fresh meat. The prolonged shelf life for the packaged meat products ranges from about 40 to 90 days after which the meat still blooms up to a desired fiery red colour upon exposure of the packaged meat product to oxygen. The invention described in these two U S patents relates to a tray being over wrapped to provide a first and a second enclosed region, a first perforation means disposed along upper portions of said tray allows for gas exchange between said first and second enclosed regions without clogging due to run off juices from the meat or due to shifting of the meat within the tray; and a second perforation means disposed in the plastic wrapping material to permit gas exchange between said second enclosed region and a region outside of said over-wrapped tray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a unique lidded tray made of any material that can be easily vented. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The tray generally indicated as <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made up of two layers, a base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a top layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. These two layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed and joined together to produce a strong tray using minimum material. Preferred materials of construction for the tray would include but are not limited to thermoplastic such as polyvinyl and polystyrene. An outwardly protruding lip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed along the side and end walls of the top layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The top layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with vent holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> preferably placed in the bottom of each channel or corrugations <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is formed in the base of layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. These vent holes allow the juices from the meat to flow into the channels <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which are formed when the base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and top layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are brought together to form the tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The channels <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can hold a food grade absorbent. The vent holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> also allow the removal of air from the channel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when the tray is placed in a vacuum. The channel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are sealed around the perimeter of the base of the tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The sealing of the channel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at point <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, isolates the channel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which can then hold the meat juices from the channels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which are in the sides of the tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The channels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enable the side walls of the tray to vent when placed under a vacuum. In each corner of layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> a protrusion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed. In the top of this protrusion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> a hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed. In each corner of base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> a slot <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed. The hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the slot <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> enable the inside of the tray to be vented when a lid is sealed onto the lip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A lid such as a web of clear plastic wrapping material is heat sealed around the lip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the above description that the tray of the present invention is not over wrapped, rather it is lidded. The tray of the present invention can easily be evacuated when the tray is used in known case-ready packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The packaging system includes a tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which is made up of at least one layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has an inner surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an outer surface not shown. The inner surface is made up of a base portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and side portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be grooved, corrugated or wavy shaped. The tray has at least one corner <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> there being at least one elongate member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which is preferably, chimney shaped with an aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the upper most end. The elongate member is preferably hollow and moulded within the shape of the layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also has a lip L, which is made up of a flat portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has ribs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which can be any shape but are preferably formed from the layer itself by deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a view of a second or bottom layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the tray looking from underneath. This shows the outer surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a base portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and side portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be grooved, corrugated or wavy shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> there is a second layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which nests and joins with layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is preferably situated underneath layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also has an inner surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which is made up of a base portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and side portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a lip <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and corners <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Within corner <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> it is preferred that there is a slender member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which matches or is similar in shape to the elongate member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of top layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that when the two layers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are nested, they inter-fit therein to create a space therebetween the layers. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the space can be made up of an closed portion or enclosed portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and an open portion or a side portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which can be drained or evacuated through channel <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The enclosed space <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is made up by welding or joining the two layers in a line <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> that borders the base portion. This space can be used to contain any product leakage or product juices. A soaker pad <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be used in combination to also soak up any product juices. The space <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> outside this weld line comprises mainly a space adjoining the side portions of the tray. This side portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> space is open at the upper end and can evacuated when evacuation occurs. Layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a series of ribs or corrugations <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that are moulded within the surface, which are similar to the ribs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. These ribs serve to provide a strengthening means and a means of enabling the juices to be drained or directed away. To enter the enclosed space the juices through an aperture means <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the first layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can have channels in the lip to facilitate evacuation. The trays can be made of any suitable material however some examples that are preferred are open celled materials, closed cell materials or solid material such as plastics. The figures show the tray being rectangular in shape. Any shape that suits the product, is envisaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In use, layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is nested and joined, with layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which are joined together to create an enclosed space therebetween and or to strengthen the tray. The joining can be by spot welding. After which, a lid or cover (not shown) is attached to the top layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Preferably the lid is hermetically sealed to the tray. The lid is attached to the lip portion of layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the lid may comprise generally of a clear plastics wrapping material. This material is heat sealed around the lip after which, the tray made up of the two layers and the lidded portion, can then be evacuated and then sealed in an appropriate manner e.g. in an oxygen resistant barrier bag. Evacuation is used to help preserve the stored product and extend its shelf life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In combination with the double layered tray or as an alternative, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> the tray can have at least one micro perforation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the walls to also assist in venting when the tray and lid assembly is evacuated. The perforations <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are too small to allow juices etc to exit. Yet another alternative for the tray or in combination with, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Here the tray can have a recessed portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the upper portion of the sidewall. This recess <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be at least one &lsquo;micro slit&rsquo; and provides a gap bordered by the lid that may be attached to the tray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The packaging system includes a cover or &lsquo;lid&rsquo; which can be sealed e.g. with plastics sheeting hermetically sealed. The covering of plastics is preferably sealed to the lip and not overwraped. Overwrapping though may occur unintentionally. This cover can be leakproof i.e. juices can not leak out. It is preferred that the cover has no perforations or apertures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> a single layer tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which can be used in a modified or controlled atmosphere has an inner surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The tray can be any shape that fits the product to be housed and or the volume of exudate to be produced or fits the display means or fits the method of atmospheric control used. In a modified or controlled atmosphere, the tray can be sealed with a cover or lid member which may then be contained in a further barrier means or barrier container. The tray layer can be grooved or corrugated or wavy shaped. The barrier container can be an oxygen barrier bag. In further processing the bagged trayed product may be vented to remove and modify unwanted gaseous atmosphere. The tray has a base portion <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and side portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>.
