<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure relates to subject matter contained in priority Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-174430, filed on Jun. 8, 2001, the contents of which is herein expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a compressor with a built-in electric motor which is suitable to be mounted on a mobile structure such as a motor vehicle. The invention also relates to a mobile structure having such a compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a vehicle driven only by an engine, a compressor driven by the engine has been used for air-conditioning the vehicle compartment with the compressor being mounted alongside of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hybrid vehicles having both an engine and an electric motor and traveling by use of one of them according to conditions have been practically used for going on public roads. Air-conditioning of the vehicle compartment of this hybrid vehicle is made by a refrigerating compressor driven by the engine in the same manner as conventional engine-driven vehicles, which is mounted alongside of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is proposed that the engines of hybrid vehicles should be shut off while they are temporarily stationary at a place such as a traffic light in order to reduce effects of the engine upon the environment. When the proposal is followed with a vehicle where a compressor driven by the engine is used, air-conditioning stops each time when the vehicle stops, causing problem for the driver and passengers in the compartment in summer and winter seasons, and especially in regions with extremely cold or hot climate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For solving such a problem, there is an idea of adopting a compressor <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> to be driven by an electric motor, especially a compressor to be used for air-conditioning in a building as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The compressor with a built-in electric motor is housed in a container <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> made of iron, together with a compression mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and an electric motor <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. In the hybrid vehicle, furthermore, the arrangement of devices in an engine room is based on that of the conventional motor vehicle. Thus, there is no space or location for installing the conventional compressor with the built-in electric motor for air-conditioning in the building in the engine room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> What is worse, the conventional compressor with the built-in electric motor has large axial dimensions. That is, a discharge port <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, a suction port <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, inner and outer electric connection parts <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and a mounting leg portion <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> are longitudinally extended from both ends of the container <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Such a complicated construction of the compressor is hardly incorporated in an electric-powered vehicle which has been only realized in a small-sized vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Simultaneously, the conventional compressor with the built-in electric motor is made of iron, so that the total weight thereof is about 9 kg or more. Thus, it becomes a problem in realizing the high speed and the energy saving because of the increase in driving load when it is mounted on the mobile structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It becomes urgent business to provide a small-sized and lightweight compressor with a built-in electric motor now in a tendency of planning an electric operation of various kinds of load by using a working voltage of 42 volts in a gasoline-powered vehicle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric-powered vehicle. For this reason, it is considered to use a compressor <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> with a built-in electric motor having a container <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> made of aluminum as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An electric motor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is operated under the inverter control so as to correspond to various kinds of conditions. An inverter control device <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> responsible for the inverter control and the compressor <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> are mounted on an appropriate fixing member in the vicinity thereof. As shown in Pig. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, when the compressor <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is fixed on the engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is fixed and supported on another fixing member <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> to avoid the high temperature engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, even though the working voltage increases from 12 volts to 42 volts, it is still a low voltage compared with a working voltage of about 100 volts to 200 volts which is used for an air conditioning intended for home use. Consequently, if it tends to obtain the same output as that of about 100 volts to 200 volts, there is a need to feed a large current. For addressing such a requirement, a plurality of wirings for supplying the electric power between the inverter control device <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and a terminal <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> provided on the container <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, a plurality of wirings for supplying the electric power between the terminal <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and the electric motor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and an electrode are increased in size, thereby increasing the weight of the compressor. Furthermore, the generation of noise may be increased to influence on the peripheral electronic devices. In each of the cases, it will be a problem for mounting on the vehicle. What is worse, the increase in size leads to the increase in cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a compressor with a built-in electric motor suitable for a mobile structure without causing the increase in weight, cost, and noise by shortening the wiring distance from the inverter device to the electric motor. Another object of the invention is to provide a mobile structure having such a compressor with a built-in electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above objects, a first aspect of the present invention is to provide a compressor with a built-in electric motor, including: a compression mechanism; the built-in electric motor for driving the compression mechanism; and a container for housing the compression mechanism and the built-in electric motor, wherein an inverter control device that performs an inverter control on the built-in electric motor is integrally provided on a part of the container and is connected to the electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to such a configuration, since the inverter control device is provided on a part of the container, there is no need to provide comparatively long external wirings for connecting between the inverter control device and the container when the built-in electric motor housed in the container together with the compression mechanism is subjected to an inverter control by the inverter control device to operate the compression mechanism under various conditions. In addition, a single terminal can be shared between the connections for the inverter control device and the electric motor, so that one of the terminals conventionally used is removed. Accordingly, when it is mounted on the vehicle and used at a low voltage of 12 volts or 42 volts where the number of wirings and the size of electrode are increased, the wiring distance is shortened due to the elimination of external wirings, and the decrease in weight of the compressor is achieved because of reducing one of the terminals. Furthermore, the space for mounting the compressor including the inverter control device is reduced, so that the compressor is more easily mounted on the vehicle. Besides, there is an advantage in driving load and also in cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the invention is to provide a compressor with a built-in electric motor, wherein an inverter control device that performs an inverter control on the built-in electric motor is integrally provided on a body of the container in which the compression mechanism and the electric motor are housed such that they are axially arranged in a line, and the inverter control device is connected to the electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to such a configuration, the electric connection part of the inverter control device and the electric connection part of the electric motor housed in the body portion of the container become closer to each other. Thus, the length of the wiring in the container id reduced, and the weight and cost of the compressor depending on the wiring is reduced. Furthermore, the compressor of the present embodiment is easily installed in a restricted space of the vehicle since there is no need to increase the axial dimension of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> While novel features of the invention are set forth in the preceding, the invention, both as to organization and content, can be further understood and appreciated, along with other objects and features thereof, from the following detailed description and examples when taken in conjunction with the attached drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a compressor with a built-in electric motor as one of preferred embodiments of the present invention and a mobile structure having such a compressor will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings for facilitating the understanding of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the compressor is a scroll type compressor with a built-in electric motor to be mounted on an engine of a hybrid vehicle. However, the invention is not limited to such a type of compressor. The present invention is also applicable to any compressor for air-conditioning of the interior of a room in addition to the vehicle compartment of a typical mobile structure such as a motor vehicle, exerting the advantages of weight reduction and miniaturization. According to the invention, various kinds of compression mechanisms, for example rotary and reciprocation type compression mechanisms, may be used. Furthermore, any vertical type compressor may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> hybrid vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> includes a gasoline-powered engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be driven by the supply of power from a battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a rechargeable battery. While the vehicle runs using the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged. While the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a sufficient charged capacity, the motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is controlled to receive the supply of power for driving the vehicle with the motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to restrict the discharge of exhaust gas to a minimum. When the vehicle is running with the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is controlled such that the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped while the vehicle is temporally stopped, for example at a traffic light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> driven by a built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is used for an air-conditioning of the vehicle compartment of the hybrid vehicle. The compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constructed to receive the supply of power from the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to keep the air-conditioning of the vehicle compartment even though the vehicle running with the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is temporally stopped at a traffic light or the like and the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> scroll type compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to drive the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are housed in a container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to constitute the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Under the control of an inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is operated by the supply of power through a terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided as inner and exterior electric connection parts of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to actuate the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inspires a refrigerant after passing through a refrigeration cycle via a suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to compress the refrigerant. Then, the compressed refrigerant is discharged into the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to cool the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, followed by discharging the refrigerant to an external pipe via a discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to supply the refrigerant to the refrigeration cycle. Subsequently, these steps are repeated. The terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a body part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an inner terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and an external terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In addition, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a sealing structure. That is, the inner and external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are connected to each other and pass through the body part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, where the passing-through portion of the body part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is sealed with a sealant such as a glass sealant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being stored. The oil is inhaled by a pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> driven by the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The oil is then supplied to a main bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a main axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the side of the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a bearing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a coupling portion between the main axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a sliding portion of the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to make smooth. After lubricating the bearings and the sliding portion, the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> seeps through each lubricating object by means of a supply pressure and then returns to the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, followed by repeating such a lubricating process. By means of the action of a compatibility, a part of the refrigerant to be discharged into the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> brings the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> stored in an oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a part such as a sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which cannot be supplied with oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, lubricating the sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or the like. The sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is responsible for bearing a sub-axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the side of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opposite to the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the built-in electric motor of the present embodiment satisfies the requirements for maintenance free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an electrical connection between the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is simplified. In this embodiment, that is, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is integrally mounted on a part of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is electrically connected by an internal wiring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by making a connection between the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a connection terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the end of a coil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided as a part of a stator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which is housed in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> together with the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is operated by being subjected to an inverter control by means of the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, allowing the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to work under the various kinds of conditions. In brief, a plurality of comparatively long external wirings, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, which connect between the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, are not required since the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is mounted on a part of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the conventional compressor, by the way, each of the inverter control unit and the electric motor requires its own terminal. In this embodiment, however, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be shared for connecting between the inverter control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment is able to delete one of the terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which are conventionally required for both the electric motor and the inverter control device. That is, even though the dimensions of the wiring parts and the electrodes are increased as the compressor is installed in the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and is then used at a low voltage of 12 volts or 42 volts, the wiring distance is significantly shortened as much as a unnecessary part of the external wiring and one of the terminals are removed. Thus, the weight of the compressor is smaller than that of the conventional one. In addition, an installation space including the space for installing the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is reduced, so that the compressor is easily mounted on the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. There is also an advantage in driving load and also in cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is integrally mounted on a body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are arranged in a line in the axial direction. Thus, comparing with the conventional one, the distance between an electric connection part of the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and an electric connection part of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> housed in the body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., in the embodiment shown in the figure, the distance between the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the connection terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) is shortened because of the integration of the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> with the body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, the length of wiring by the internal wiring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is also shortened, and the weight and cost of the compressor depending on the wiring is reduced. Furthermore, the compressor of the present embodiment is easily installed in a restricted space of the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or the like since there is no increase in the axial dimension of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> even though the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is provided thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes an electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and an inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which are electrically connected to each other. The inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, for example, is constructed of an inverter chip provided as a multi-layered circuit. In this case, however, a concrete configuration of such a circuit is no object in particular. The electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is opposed to a high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is opposed to a low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. That is, the electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are separately placed in compartments (i.e., the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) which are formed in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to prevent them from extending from the container and being bulky. Simultaneously, the heated inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is cooled down by means of a temperature difference between the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a low-temperature refrigerant located in the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In this case, furthermore, the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is located on a position different from that of the electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to be heated by a high-temperature refrigerant in the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Thus, the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is not or hardly influenced by heat, and the inverter control function is stably achieved for a long time as the temperature of a heating portion such as an inverter chip in the inverter control part is guaranteed. Furthermore, since the electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> opposite to the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is cooled, it becomes easily to make a connection with the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> being positioned thereon for cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Here, the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is located on the discharge passage side, where the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> communicates with a discharge port <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is located on the intake passage side, where the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> communicates with a suction port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sucks the refrigerant from the outside through the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then introduce into the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to compress the sucked refrigerant. After that, the refrigerant is discharged once into the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to cool the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, followed by being discharged to the outside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, which are naturally occurred in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can be used as they are in the above movement of the refrigerant. No special passage design is required. The electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are opposite to each other with respect to the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and they are easily connected to each other through a short internal wiring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In particular, the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is just above the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and they are connected to each other through a passage <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is constructed of two structural components, a housing main body <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and an end wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be placed on an opening of the housing main body <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. That is, the housing main body <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is provided as a single structural component on which the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are separately formed. In addition, the housing main body <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is integrally constructed of an end wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As the opposite end of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided as an opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, another end wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is placed on the opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and is then fixed with a bolt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to construct the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In such a construction of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the pressure difference between the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is stably received by the housing main body <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> made of the single structural component of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are defined in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> extends over these portions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is kept stably even though there is no specific countermeasure for a differential pressure to be required for the connection between the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment is constructed of two structural components, the number of thick flange portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> or bolts <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for connecting these components are reduced, compared with that of the conventional one constructing of three structural components having two joining points. Thus, such a configuration of the present embodiment also allows the reduction in weight of the compressor, so that it is appropriate to be mounted on the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the electric portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inverter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are formed on an identical substrate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Thus, even though the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has the electrode portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inverter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which are separately formed thereon, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is simply installed in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the single substrate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> so as to be arranged opposite to the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A portion of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> facing to the high pressure side of the electrode portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and another portion of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> facing to the low pressure side of the inverter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are separated from each other through seal members <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The configuration of the compressor of the present embodiment satisfies the requirements for providing the structure with no excess space because the compressor is constructed such that the electrode portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inverter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are adjacent to each other, while the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are adjacent to each other and are opposite to the respective portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the high pressure condition and the low pressure condition for exerting a predetermined function cannot be impaired by leakage of the refrigerant even though the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> come very close to each other. One of leg portions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> integrally formed on the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is also provided as a partition between the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Such a structure prevents the significant increase in weight to be caused by providing an additional wall for the partition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are arranged in a line in the axial direction. In addition, these portions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> have their openings <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, respectively. As shown in the figure, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is placed and fixed on a tubular wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which is slightly extended outward from the periphery of the body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the above openings <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are formed. The inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is thus easily mounted on the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the outside to allow both electrode and inverter parts <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to face to the high and low pressure portions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, respectively. Here, the electrode portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed such that it is provided as the body part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. However, it is not limited to such a structure; it is also possible to prepare the body part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the electrode portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as separate components and to join them together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in the figure, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is fixed on the opening end of the tubular wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the substrate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is placed on the tubular wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> through a seal member <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the tubular wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are joined with a bolt <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The seal member <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is provided as a pressure-tight sealing structure for ensuring the pressure condition in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Here, the electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are provided on the side of the tubular wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> opposite to the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In other words, these parts <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are in an atmospheric pressure region. Thus, the predetermined high pressure portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the low pressure portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are only ensured in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that these portions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are only located between the atmospheric pressure region and the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the opposite side of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is opened to the air by means of pressure, so that a simplified mounting structure is obtained without any specific sealing structure that takes pressure in account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is protected from the influence of dust or water by being covered with a cover <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, even though the inverter control device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is in the atmospheric pressure region and is opened with respect to pressure. In such a sense, it is preferable to adapt a sealing structure for waterproof and dust control by means of a sealing member <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in the figure, the cover <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are joined with the bolt <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In this case, there is no need to provide the sealing member <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> with a pressure-resisting function. In addition, the cover <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may be made of resin or rubber. Alternatively, the cover may be of having a mounting structure such as a hook or each of various kinds of engaging parts and fitting parts, which is elastically engaged or fitted with a part of the tubular wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> or the substrate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to provide a temporal fixed condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the electrode part <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inverter part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are connected to each other through a bus-bar <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The structure for connecting these parts <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is simplified, allowing the reduction in cost and the increase in durability to withstand vibrations or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By the way, the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of an aluminum material, allowing the reduction in weight. Thus, it is appropriately mounted on the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or the like. In addition, there is an advantage in which various shapes of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be easily obtained by means of a mass production using a die forming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> From the above description, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in each of the cases described above is appropriately applied for a mobile structure to be used together with the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be moved. In addition, it is also appropriately applied for constructing a mobile structure such as a vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on which the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mounted together with the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may not be limited to a specific one such as a gasoline-powered vehicle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric-powered vehicle. The present invention can be applied on various kinds of the mobile structures including special-purpose vehicles and working-purpose vehicles. In addition, the invention can be applied in air-conditioning systems for domestic use or the like for noise reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is no need to provide comparatively long external wirings for connecting between the inverter control device and the container, which has been used in the conventional compressor. In addition, a single terminal is shared between the connections for the inverter control device and the electric motor, so that one of the terminals conventionally used is removed. Thus, the wiring distance is extremely shortened and the decrease in weight of the compressor is achieved. Furthermore, the space for mounting the compressor including the inverter control device is reduced, so that the compressor is more easily mounted on the vehicle or the like. Besides, there is also an advantage in driving load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, furthermore, comparing with the conventional one, the electric connection part of the inverter control device and the electric connection part of the electric motor housed in the body portion of the container become more close to each other. Thus, the length of the wiring in the container is reduced, and the weight and cost of the compressor depending on the wiring is reduced. Furthermore, the compressor of the invention is easily installed in a restricted space of the vehicle or the like since there is no need to increase the axial dimension of the container including the inverter control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom. </paragraph>
