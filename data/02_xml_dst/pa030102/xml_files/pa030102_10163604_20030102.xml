<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a washing method for dirty membrane modules contaminated in the processes, which use a membrane module, of seawater desalination, brackish water demineralization, purified water production, solution condensation, effluent condensation, colloidal separation, salt manufacture, salt decomposition, soda manufacture and the like, in addition, in the process of membrane filtration of water being treated such as river water, well water, industrial water, industrial effluent and the like. More particularly, it relates to a washing method, which is contrived so as to decrease frequency of washing, for membrane modules, a gel particle for washing a separation membrane module and a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A membrane module means an element obtained by modularizing a membrane such as a reverse osmosis membrane, an ultra-filtration membrane, an ion-exchange membrane, a dialysis membrane, a permeation vaporization membrane and the like so as to be installed into a membrane filtration apparatus. It has been popularly used for seawater desalination, brackish water demineralization, purified water production, solution condensation, effluent condensation, colloidal separation, salt manufacture, salt decomposition, soda manufacture, and filtration-clarification process of river water, well water, industrial water, industrial effluent and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in accordance with elapsing of operation hours, a membrane surface of such a module is clogged due to building up of scale or contaminant such as organic compounds, various microorganism or crystal particularly thereon. Therefore, the permission pressure is gradually increased, and resulting in decreasing hourly flow rate of permeate as treated water therefrom. So as to wash a membrane module having a contaminated membrane surface, a chemical washing method using a chemical washing liquid has been employed; further various methods have been proposed and employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, a method circulating a washing liquid to the primary-side of a membrane module is disclosed in Japan Laid-Open Patent Application H1-307407/1989. Further a washing method (a reverse washing method) permeating and circulating a washing liquid from the secondary-side to the primary-side of a membrane module is disclosed in Japan Laid-Open Patent Application H7-60072/1995. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMRY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 1. The Subjects to be solved by the present invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in such chemical washing methods, the filtration should be suspended during the washing, thereby resulting in big time waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, although it was proposed that a method of controlling generation of microorganism or scale by adding sodium hypochloride (NaOCl) into raw water being treated during a filtration step of effluent water (Japan Laid- Open Patent Application H7-275671/1995), the permeate containing even a minute amount of sodium hypochloride is to be released into the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In addition, there has been a problem in membrane permeation treatment using a membrane module washed by a conventional chemical washing method; namely it has been required to wash the membrane module again within a short period because the permission pressure increased sharply in accordance with passage of the operation time for the membrane permeation. Therefore, economical improvement of membrane permeation treatment using a membrane module has been difficult due to becoming shorter of a period between washings, namely shortened operation time for the membrane permeation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, a method prevents the increase of the permission pressure by introducing a gel material as a washing material into a membrane filtration system (Japan Laid-Open Patent Application H9-308883/1997). However, the gel material suitable for a washing material was limited, therefore a gel material having reasonable softness not damaging a membrane surface as well as reasonable hardness enabling a membrane surface to wash adequately has not been obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the subjects of the present invention are to provide a highly effective washing method for a membrane module, a gel particle suitable for the method and a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 2. The method to solve the Subjects </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present inventors accumulated intensive research and development so as to solve the aforementioned subjects and found that, differing from conventional chemical washing methods, the gel particles being gelled by absorbing water appropriately are coexisted with raw water being treated and suspended therein so that it is possible to physically remove scale, microorganism, dirty material, crystals and the like built-up on a membrane through contacting the gel particles with the internal surface of a separation membrane module; subsequently possible to prevent the permission pressure of a membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present inventions are as follows; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (1) A gel particle for washing a separation membrane module, which comprises an organic polymeric compound having a specific gravity in water from 0.9 to 1.25, a volume swelling ratio in water from 150% to 4000% and a compressive yield stress in water from 2.0 MPa to 10.0 MPa thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (2) The gel particle for washing a separation membrane module defined in above (1), wherein the organic polymeric compound is a polyurethane water-absorbing gel obtained from a reaction of a long-chain polyol compound and a short-chain polyol compound with an isocyanate compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (3) A manufacturing method of a gel particle for washing a separation membrane module, which comprises plasticizing a thermoplastic organic polymeric compound, which is gelled by absorbing water, obtained from a reaction of a long-chain polyol compound and a short-chain polyol compound with an isocyanate compound by heating to the melting temperature thereof, hence extruding it into a strand shape followed by cutting it to pellets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (4) A washing method for a separation membrane module, which comprises adding the gel particle defined herein equivalent to 3 to 40% of the internal capacity of a membrane module into a liquid being treated and suspending it therein, removing and washing built-up materials on the membrane through contacting the gel particle to the membrane and the internal surface of the module, thereby resulting in preventing the membrane from being obstructed and increasing the permeation pressure thereof; wherein the gel particle comprises an organic polymeric compound with a specific gravity in water from 0.9 to 1.25, a volume swelling ratio in water from 150% to 4000% and a compressive yield stress in water from 2.0 MPa to 10.0 MPa thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (5) The washing method defined in above (4), wherein a reverse osmosis membrane, an ultra-filtration membrane, an ion-exchange membrane, a dialysis membrane or a permeation vaporization membrane is employed to a membrane module.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A gel particle being used for a washing method of the present invention comprising an organic polymeric compound; as it is explained by using the membrane module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an adding amount of a gel particle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for washing into the primary-side depends on the property of the raw water <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The raw water <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplied to the primary-side <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is permeated through the membrane <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, reaching to the second-side <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and then discharged as permeate. If the raw water tends easily to foul the membrane, an adding amount of the gel particle should be increased. In the case of the raw water less fouling it, a decreased amount thereof is reasonable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The amount of a gel particle to be added into the primary-side should be equivalent to 3 to 40% of the module capacity. If it is less than 3%, washing efficiency thereof is reduced due to low in contact numbers of the gel particles with the membrane surface If it is more than 40%, the gel particle volume in the primary-side is too large, therefore the amount of the raw water is decreased, consequently resulting in reduced efficiency thereof. In addition, the movement thereof is slowed down due to collide of the gel particles each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Herein, the module capacity of the present invention means the internal capacity of the section (the primary-side) of the module where the gel particle is added in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> So as to make uniform movement thereof in the primary-side (a reaction vessel), the specific gravity of the gel particle in water should be from 0.9 to 1.25. It is possible to control the specific gravity by incorporating a higher specific gravity powder such as barium sulfate and the like therein during synthesis of a thermoplastic gel particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Herein, the specific gravity in water means the specific gravity of the gel particle swelled completely in water. The measurement method thereof is as follows (refer <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> {circle over (1)} Arrange a measuring flask with an airtight stopper, dry it at 100&deg; C. and then measure the weight of the flask with the stopper at 25&deg; C. (A gm), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> {circle over (2)} Fill it with purified water up to the marked line thereof and put the stopper in it, then measure the weight thereof at 25&deg; C. (B gm), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> {circle over (3)} Put a reasonable amount of a gel particle (pellet type, chip type), which is swelled completely in water, into the flask and fill it with the water according to the same method as above {circle over (2)}, then measure the weight thereof at 25&deg; C. (C gm), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> {circle over (4)} Take out and wipe the water off all the gel particles (pellets or chips) and measure the weight, at 25&deg; C, of the well wiped gel particles (D gm), and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> {circle over (5)} Calculate the specific gravity in water in accordance with the following equation;</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>The specific gravity in water &equals;<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>gm</italic></highlight>)/&lsqb;(<highlight><italic>B</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>gm</italic></highlight>)&minus;<highlight><italic>A</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>gm</italic></highlight>))&minus;(<highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>gm</italic></highlight>)&minus;<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>gm</italic></highlight>))&rsqb;</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the case of wastewater treatment by using a membrane permeation apparatus particularly, for example, BOD, COD, nitrogen compounds, activated sludge (microorganism), activated sludge floc, microzoon, or the like might be contained in the raw water in the primary-side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>; therefore, the treatment of contaminant and the permeation are possible to be carried out in parallel while injecting diffusing air into the module. In this case, the gel particle added in the primary-side acts not only as the module-washing agent but also as a carrier for microorganism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Although there is no restriction on size or shape of the gel particle being used, a dice shape, a columnar shape and a spherical shape are preferable illustrations so as to provide a larger external surface area thereof. For instance, a particle such as a dice shape with a side of 2 to 8 mm, a columnar shape of 2 to 8 in diameter and 2 to 8 in length, a spherical shape of 2 to 8 in diameter and the like is more preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the case of a flat membrane stack type module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is preferable to control a size of a gel particle so as to get into a space between adjacent membrane smoothly since the space is generally from 5 to 20 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Although there is no restriction on membrane materials, following materials are illustrated. As a dialysis membrane, a polyvinyl alcohol type membrane, a cellulose type membrane, a polyacrylonitrile type membrane, a polyacrylonitrile methacrylic sulfonic acid type membrane, a polyether- carbonate type membrane, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer type membrane, a polymethacrylic acid type membrane and the like have been utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As an ultrafiltration membrane, a polysulfone type membrane, a polyphenyl sulfone type membrane, a polyether sulfone type membrane, a polyimide type membrane and the like have been utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As a reverse osmosis membrane, a polyamide type membrane, a polyethylene imine type membrane, a polyether type membrane and the like have been utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As an ion-exchange membrane, a styrene-divinylbenzene type membrane, various types of polymer cation-exchange membranes, various types of polymer anion-exchange membranes, a perfluorocarbon membrane and the like have been utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In addition, the washing method of the present invention and the gel particle for the washing can be applied to separation membrane modules using a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, a butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer type membrane, a polydimethyl siloxane membrane, a modified polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, a modified polytetrafluoroethylene membrane and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It is particularly preferable to apply the washing method of the present invention to separation membranes comprising an organic polymer. Such separation membranes are a flat stack type or a bundled hollow fiber type; however, they are not good in abrasion resistance or impact-strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the addition of a sand particle, hard-resin powder or a hard-resin pellet into the module to remove physically scale or microorganism built-up on a separation membrane module and wash it is highly possible to damage the membrane, therefore durability of the membrane is lowered. On the other hand, if too soft material is added, it is distracted due to contact with the membrane; therefore washing result is not expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present inventors found that a gel particle comprising an organic polymeric compound which is gelled by absorbing water is suitable as a washing particle being used for the washing method of the present invention. In particular, a gel particle having a specific gravity in water in the range from 0.9 to 1.25, a volume swelling ratio in water, as defined by the following equation (2), from 150% to 4000% and a compressive yield stress in water in terms of completely swelled in water, as defined by the following equation (3), from 2.0 to 10.0 MPa is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The volume-swelling ratio (%)&equals;the volume in terms of completely swelled in water (cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) &times;100 /the volume in terms of absolutely dried (cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) --- equation(2); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> wherein, &ldquo;the absolutely dried&rdquo; means the terminating point of the weight decreasing of the gel particle while drying it at 100&deg; C. &ldquo;The completely swelled in water&rdquo;means the terminating point of the volume variation thereof while soaking the gel particle in purified water at 25&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The compressive yield stress &sgr; (MPa)&equals;F(N)/A(mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) ----equation (3); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> wherein, &ldquo;F&rdquo; means the compressed lard (N) when the particle is destroyed by pressure and &ldquo;A&rdquo; means the projected cross-sectional areas (mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) of the particle before conducting the compression test thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the volume-swelling ratio in water is less than 150%, it is not the water-absorbing gel because the water absorption is too low, attraction of microorganism thereof is poor and the water absorption ratio is too low. If it is more than 4000%, it is not possible to put practical use due to too low mechanical strength thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If the compressive yield stress is less than 2.0 MPa, the gel particle becomes smaller due to crash or wears during flowage thereof, therefore desired washing result is not achieved. If it is more than 10.0 MPa, the separation membrane is possibly damaged thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A chemical structure of a resin as a material for the gel particle of the present invention is not restrictive provided that it has the aforementioned properties. The following is illustrative of the gel particle being used and a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
