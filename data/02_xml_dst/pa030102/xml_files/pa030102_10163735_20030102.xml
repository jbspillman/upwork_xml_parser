<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional alarm system issues a warning when detecting an abnormality in a network or computer machine, or monitors a production line in a factory, and gives an alert and stops the production line when an abnormality occurs in the production line. In a monitoring operation, the conventional alarm system employs specific hardware and software which display a warning on a monitor or sound a buzzer or bell, as alarm methods, in order to alarm to an operator and maintenance person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The alarm method previously employed in the conventional alarm system often fails to alarm to the operator and maintenance person. A reliable alarm is done by certainly alarm to their alarm media. Alarm methods therefore need to carefully change according to the operator and maintenance person. To add a new alarm method to an existing system, a complicated installation of the new method and even a reconstruction of the system should be considered. Even though the installation and reconstruction can be achieved, new requirements of the alarm system will generate according to time and circumstances. For example, when new alarm destinations of monitoring persons (alarm receivers) change due to personnel relocation, a consideration for another installation into the existing system is required, causing a heavy burden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to easily construct a reliable alarm system. Another object of the present invention is to construct an easy to maintain, expandable, and flexible alarm system minimizes influence on an existing environment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention will be concretely described in the following with reference to the appended drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram, which explains one example of an automatic alarm system according to the present invention. A alarm device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (computer) receives detect signals from monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such as various types of detectors and sensors, and from a monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (software). The outputs of the monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are input to the alarm device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via a contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The computer of the alarm device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and other programs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and connects to a display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to a network <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and telephone line <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by a network connecting device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and modem <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also connected to an annunciation device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as a revolving light, which is controlled by the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is further connected to a computer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of an electronic mail system, and thus the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits an electronic mail via the computer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may independently transmit an electronic mail by connecting to the computer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the electronic mail system. The electronic mail system can be contained in the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the alarm device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a contact state monitoring module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which monitors states of contacts of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a command analyzing module <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which analyzes commands generated by the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an information obtaining module <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which obtains information required for executing the commands, a program executing module <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which executes the commands, a massage output module <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which alarms to specified destinations by using specified means, and a result output module <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which outputs the results and records of the alarm processes. In addition, the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, group information <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, alarm content information <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, schedule information <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and contact information <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as the information required for executing the commands, and includes execution result/record information <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in which the results of the alarms are recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> monitor a state of a system such as a network and computer machine, a manufacturing plant, and a production line. When the monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> detects an abnormality of these monitored systems and generates an abnormal signal, the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the alarm device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> activates to carry out a alarm process according to the information which the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> manages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The output contacts of the monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are connected to the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. An RS-232C interface connects the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> detects an abnormality, the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives the contact output of the monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and RS-232C interface, and thereby the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> executes a alarm command in such a manner as described below. The monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which employs, for example, a remaining amount sensor for a fuel tank, alerts warning, when the remaining amount of the fuel tank drops below a certain level. An alert signal (contact output) is input to the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and thereby the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operating in the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> executes the alarm command to transmit a necessary alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may operate on a computer connecting to the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via a network, or on the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which contains the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an executing command for an abnormal event is previously defined. A alarm command of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is automatically executed as the defined executing command when an abnormal event occurs. For example, when the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> employs a network monitoring software, a display content of a screen changes in response to the occurrence of the abnormal event. A alarm command is previously defined in the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as the automatic action when the display content changes. The alarm command is automatically executed when the display content changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The automatic alarm system of the present invention can interface with the existing monitoring systems <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> only by executing the command of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in response to the detection of the abnormal event. With this command level interface for alarm, the automatic alarm system of the present invention can be easily constructed interfacing with an existing monitoring system which enables a command execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When a command of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is executed, the command analyzing module <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> analyzes the command, and the argument and option thereof, and obtains the user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, group information <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and schedule information <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that are defined in the information obtaining module <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> based on the result of the analysis. Next, the program executing module <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> executes the analyzed command, and then the message output module <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> outputs (alarms) a message to an obtained destination. The result output module <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> outputs the result and record of the execution to a file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As described above, because only a command execution is needed to alarm, a alarm system which exerts small influence on an existing environment can be constructed by adding a tool required for alarm, such as the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to the existing environment. There are two command execution procedures. One procedure is that the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> receives a signal indicating the abnormal event detected by the monitoring equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and thereby automatically outputs a command. Another procedure is that, when the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> detects the abnormal event, the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> starts in response to a command execution. In both two procedures, an automatic command execution enables an immediate and reliable alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Since the information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> required for alarm are managed together by the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, only the information of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be changed without changing the existing environments <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> even when a sudden operation alteration occurs. Therefore, the present invention can be easily used for changing persons to whom a message is alarmed, adding a alarm medium of a maintenance person, and limiting a alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an explanation diagram of one example of the user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes information on users to whom the alarm software alarms and information on alarm means such as a telephone, pager, and electronic mail, and on their destinations such as a telephone number, pager number, and an electronic mail address of the users. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> portable phone number and electronic mail address of a user &ldquo;AAAA&rdquo;, and a portable phone number, pager number, and electronic mail address of a user &ldquo;BBBB&rdquo; are registered as the alarm means and destinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an explanation diagram of one example of the group information <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The group information <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> contains group IDs and plural destination information. In a group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, an activation of the revolving light, telephone call to the user &ldquo;AAAA&rdquo;, messaging to the pager of the user &ldquo;BBBB&rdquo;, and sending of an electronic mail to the user &ldquo;BBBB&rdquo; are registered. In a group ID: <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, a sending of an electronic mail to the user &ldquo;AAAA&rdquo; and telephone call to the user &ldquo;BBBB&rdquo; are registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an explanation diagram of one example of the alarm content information <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In the alarm content information <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the contents to be alarmed are classified according to the group IDs. The group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> shows that content registered in Tel_file_A is to be alarmed with a telephone, and a content registered in mail_file_C is to be alarmed with an electronic mail. The group ID: <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> shows that a content registered in pb_file_A is to be alarmed with a pager, and a content registered in mail_file_E is to be alarmed with an electronic mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> explains an example of the schedule information <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. In the schedule information <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, a permission period during which a alarm can be transmitted, and an inhibition period during which a alarm cannot be transmitted, are defined for each media. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> circle mark expresses the permission period and a cross mark expresses the inhibition period. The schedule information of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is defined for a whole system. The schedule information can be also defined for each user or each group. In addition to the period, day and date information can be added to the schedule information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A procedure that the automatic alarm system of the present invention alarms in response to a monitor signal from the monitoring tool (software) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram which explains an interfacing between the monitoring tool (software) and automatic alarm system of the present invention. In the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a alarm command provided by the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is defined as the automatic action when a failure is detected. A content of the alarm command to be executed can be changed according to failure types, in such a way that a alarm A is defined for a failure A, or a alarm B is defined for a failure B. For example, a &ldquo;Cmd group ID&rdquo; is defined as the command executed when the monitoring tool detects the failure A. When the failure A occurs, the command for the failure A is automatically executed, and thereby a alarm is transmitted to the destination group specified by the group ID. Likewise, a alarm for the failure B can be processed with the alarm command defined to be executed when the failure B occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are in the same computer, a alarm can be done by a standard command executing function of the computer without a particular interface between the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. That is to say, when the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> executes a command of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> activates to alarm. When the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are respectively in different computers, the monitoring tool <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in one computer executes a command of another computer which contains the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by using, for example, the standard UNIX remote shell function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart that shows one example process after a alarm command of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> starts. When the command starts, the user information and group information which the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> manages is extracted according to the information (arguments, options) when the command is activated (step <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For example, a command &ldquo;Cmd 1000&rdquo; is executed to alarm to the group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When the command &ldquo;Cmd 1000&rdquo; is executed, it is determined whether or not destination information exists in reference to the group information <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and individual user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> forming the group information (step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>). When the destination information does not exist, an error message is output and then the command execution ends (step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>). In the group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the revolving light (electronic device) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is first activated, and a alarm is transmitted to in the following order: the telephone of the user AAAA, the pager of the user BBBB, the electronic mail of the user BBBB. The alarm to each destination is done in reference to the user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After checking the destination information, the alarm command sequentially refers to the schedule information <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> representing the schedule of each alarm media such as the revolving light and telephone (step <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>), and checks whether or not the execution time of each alarm media is in the inhibition period (step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the current time (09:40:15) is out of the inhibition period between zero o&apos;clock and two o&apos;clock, the alarm content information <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is obtained to be transmitted as a message (step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>). Tel_file_A, which is a content of a alarm to the telephone of the group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is sent to the above-described destination (step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>). Likewise, the messages are transmitted to the specified destinations by using a pager and electronic mail. Lastly, the results of such message transmissions are output to a file (step <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the output contents representing the dates and times and operations of the executions. The destinations, dates and times, and success or failure of the alarm process can be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A alarm procedure by the alarm system of the present invention in response to monitor signals from the monitoring equipment (hardware) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram which explains an interfacing between monitoring devices and the alarm system of the present invention. The monitoring devices <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, which are respectively provided for various monitorings, are connected to the alarm system. Each monitoring device closes a contact (turns on) when it detects an abnormality of a monitored object. The output contacts of the monitoring devices <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are connected to the contacts of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. The contacts of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are numbered from 1 to 3. For example, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> connects to the contact <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> connects to the contact <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the monitoring device <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> connects to the contact <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in which the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operates. A contact state monitoring module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the monitoring software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> periodically checks states of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and previously defines a alarm content for a state of each contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an example of definition for the contact numbers of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and for the contents of the alarm processes. This information of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is previously defined to indicate how the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operates when each contact of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> closes, and is stored in the contact information <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the monitoring device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> detects an abnormality, the contact of the monitoring device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> closes (turns on), and simultaneously the contact <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> closes. The alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> detects such a state that the contact <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has turned on, and thereby a alarm process is done according to the alarm definition (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, alarm to the group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>) for the contact <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Likewise, when the monitoring device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> detects an abnormality, a alarm process is done according to the alarm definition for the contact <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and when the monitoring device <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> detects an abnormality, a alarm process is done according to the alarm definition for the contact <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As described above, these respective monitoring devices are connected to the different contacts of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and are provided with different alarm contents previously defined by the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to carry out different alarm processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart which shows a procedure of a alarm process according to a contact signal from the monitoring device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When a state that one of contacts of the contact input device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has closed is detected (step <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>), a alarm process for the closed contact is checked using the definition information shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), and it is determined whether or not to alarm (step <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>). When the alarm process has not been defined (a content of a alarm process does not exist), the alarm process finishes without any execution. When the alarm process has been defined (a content of the alarm process exists), a alarm command relevant to the alarm process is executed (step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>), and then the same process as from the step <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> downwards is done, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The flow of the process towards the alarm command execution has been described above. The automatic alarm system of the present invention can be altered only by changing the contents of respective information items <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> managed by the alarm software <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. To be more precise, the user information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the group information <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the alarm content information <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the schedule information <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the contact information <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are changed. For example, when the name of the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes from &ldquo;AAAA&rdquo; to &ldquo;CCCC&rdquo; because of a personnel relocation, &ldquo;AAAA&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is replaced with &ldquo;CCCC&rdquo;, and the destination of &ldquo;AAAA&rdquo; is also replaced with that of &ldquo;CCCC&rdquo;. When there is an alteration to a work time of the user BBBB, the schedule information in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is changed. When a alarm content of the electronic mail in the group ID: <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> needs to be altered, the file name &ldquo;mail_file_C&rdquo; in the alarm content information in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is replaced with another file name, or the whole content of &ldquo;mail_file_C&rdquo; is changed. As described above, since the automatic alarm system added to an existing environment stands alone, the alteration to the information on the alarms can be achieved by altering only the automatic alarm system, minimizing influence on the existing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to the first invention, an automatic alarm system can be added to an existing environment, and exert small influence on the existing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to the second and third invention, an alarm command is executed in response to a contact signal from a monitoring device, or as an automatic action, so that the automatic alarm system can interface with various monitoring systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> According to the forth invention, alarm contents are managed together, so that destinations can be easily altered, alarm media can be easily selected, and a sudden operation alteration can be flexibly dealt with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to the fifth invention, alarm functions stand alone, so that an automatic alarm system with superior maintainability can be constructed. </paragraph>
