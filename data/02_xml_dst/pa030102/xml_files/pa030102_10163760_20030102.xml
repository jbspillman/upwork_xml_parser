<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to data communication networks. More particularly, the invention relates to network elements that employ a cross-connect switch matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Transport networks are well known in the data communication art. Transport networks include ATM networks, Frame Relay networks, the Synchronous Optical Network (&ldquo;SONET&rdquo;), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (&ldquo;SDH&rdquo;) networks, and others. A transport network typically includes a plurality of network elements (elements) coupled together by one or more data communication channels (or paths). These network elements may, in turn, couple to local elements or networks, or may couple to other network structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a SONET network, the basic transmission signal is referred to as the Synchronous Transport Signal level 1 (STS-1) signal. Higher level signals are referred to as STS-N signals, and are byte-interleaved multiples of the basic STS-1 level signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an SDH network, the basic transmission signal is referred to as STM-1. An STM-1 signal has the same bandwidth as a SONET STS-3 signal. Higher level SDH signals are referred to as STM-N signals, and are byte-interleaved multiples of the basic STM-1 level signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Many of the network elements in the transport networks include switching hardware that are used to switch data from one data communication channel to another. The switching process in a network element is typically carried out using a hardware cross-connect switch matrix. The cross-connect switch matrix includes a plurality of input ports, a plurality of output ports, and a plurality of switches. In a network element in a SONET/SDH network, the cross-connect typically switches a plurality of input STS-N signals coupled to the input ports to a plurality of output STS-N signals on the output ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Switch matrices are well known in the art. Switch matrices are usually built to handle a certain type of payload. For example, when applied to a SONET or SDH type of payload, known switch matrices would typically switch STS-1 type signals, VT1.5 type signal, or other types of SONET/SDH type payloads, such as VC-4 or VC-12. These known switch matrices are limited to switching a particular payload type, and typically cannot be used to simultaneously switch different payload types or sizes. Thus, for example, a cross-connect switch matrix designed to switch SONET type payloads typically cannot also switch SDH type payloads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an illustration of a known TSI based switch matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The known TSI based switch matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> typically comprises an input channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an output channel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a write engine <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a buffer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a read engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The write engine <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> receives data or a payload from the input channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and writes the payload or data to the buffer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The read engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reads data from the buffer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and outputs the data via an output channel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to accomplish a time slot interchange (TSI) cross connection. The switch matrix control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> controls the reading by the read engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the output channel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The channels are read out in a specific time slot to accomplish TSI cross-connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The known TSI based switch matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the capability of switching a number of fixed size elements (e.g., the matrix can switch a number of STS-1, or VT1.5, or VC12 . . . elements). The control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> only works with payloads having the same size. In a 2.5 Gbs switch matrix that is VT1.5 granular, such as a matrix that receives a STS-48 equivalent payload via the input channel, the control would view the matrix as having 1344 linear elements (48*28&equals;1344 VT1.5 elements) that have to be TSI-ed (cross-connected) onto a set of 1344 linear output elements. In this example, the control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would generate a reading sequence that it provides to the read engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for reading the 1344 VT1.5 elements out of the buffer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the output channel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to accomplish the TSI switching. If part of the payload included VT2 elements, this VT1.5 granular switch matrix could not be used. The known switch matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is designed to operate on only a single payload type and size, and thus it cannot be used to simultaneously switch between different payload sizes (e.g., VT1.5 or VT2), or between different payload types (e.g., SONET and SDH). With this type of known switch matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is essentially a lookup vector containing 1344 elements for an input bandwidth of 2.5 Gbs. The lookup vector represents the output sequence, spaced linearly in time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawing figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> sets forth a system diagram of an exemplary transport network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The transport network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown includes two ring networks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The first ring network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a SONET network and the second ring network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an SDH network. Each ring network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of network elements, labeled N0-N6, coupled in the ring structures by one or more communication paths <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the two paths <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B transport a plurality of SONET STS-1 (or STS-N) data streams in opposite directions about the SONET ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the two paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B transport a plurality of SDH STM-1 (or STM-N) data streams in opposite directions about the SDH ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The communication paths <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are preferably fiber optic connections (in SONET and SDH), but could, alternatively be electrical paths or even wireless connections (in other types of networks). In the case of a fiber optic connection, paths <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B could be implemented on a single fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, on dual fibers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B, or some other combination of connections. Also, paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B could be implemented on a single fiber <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, on dual fibers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B, or some other combination of connections. In the dual fiber implementation, one of the fibers could be the working ring, and the other fiber could be the protection ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In each ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, preferably each network element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coupled to two other network elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the ring structure. For example, network element N0 is coupled to network elements N1 and N3. The coupling between the elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is two-way meaning that each element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> transmits and receives signals to and from each of the two other elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to which it is connected. Each network element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes at least two transmitter/receiver interfaces, one for each connection to another element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The network elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> could be many types of well-known network devices, such as a digital cross-connect system (&ldquo;DCCS&rdquo;), an Add-Drop Mux (&ldquo;ADM&rdquo;), switch, router, or other type of device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The network devices <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are preferably DCCSs. A DCCS is a device having an upstream network element interface, a downstream network element interface, and an add/drop interface. These DCCSs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are coupled to local elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and are used to add signals to the network data traffic from the local elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and, conversely, to drop data signals from the network data traffic to the local elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The switching, adding and dropping operations of the DCCS <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are typically performed by one or more hardware cross-connect switching system cards having one or more hardware cross connect switching matrices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One network element in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, network element N3, is coupled to two network elements in each ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This network element N3 must be capable of passing traffic between each ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Consequently, this network element has a cross-connect system and/or a cross connect switch matrix that is capable of switching traffic between each of the transport network types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another network element in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, network element N1, is coupled to two local connections L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Local connection L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is an DS-1 line that provides a VT1.5 payload to ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Local connection L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a E1 line that provides VT2 payload to ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This network element N1 must be capable of passing traffic between ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and Local loop L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and between ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and local loop L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Consequently, this network element has a cross-connect system and/or a cross connect switch matrix that is capable of switching traffic of different sizes using a single cross connect matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an exemplary cross-connect system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a network element that is capable of switching traffic having payloads of different types and/or sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The exemplary cross-connect system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises a receiver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a path overhead terminator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a virtual tributary aligner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a virtual tributary cross-connect matrix <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a virtual tributary defect assessor (Quality-TAG) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a processor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a path overhead regenerator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a transmitter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In this implementation, the receiver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> receives data, e.g. at 622 Mbs, via input ports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and converts the 622 Mbs signal to a signal that can be processed by standard logic. The converted signals are passed to the POH terminator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The POH terminator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> terminates the high order path for low bandwidth signals, (e.g. VTx and VCx), and simply passes through higher bandwidth signals, e.g. STS-1 or STM-1, that are within the received converted signals, as specified in GR-253-CORE for SONET and in ITU-T G.707 for SDH. The VT aligner receives the output from the POH terminator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and adjusts the columns of the signals to the same frequency, and aligns the column boundary. The VT TAG <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extract the quality of the signal output by the VT aligner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The cross-connect matrix <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> performs a TSI switching function on the signal output by the VT aligner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> under the control of the processor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The VT XCON matrix is the actual column-based non-blocking switch that can cross-connect any in-coming VT/VC to any outgoing VT/VC. The total bandwidth capacity of the matrix is 2.4 Gbps in this example. After leaving the cross connect matrix, the POH Re-Generator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> creates the POH column for each of the outgoing streams as specified in GR-253-CORE for SONET and in ITU-T G.707 for SDH. The transmitter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> converts the output of the POH Re-Generator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to an appropriate output stream and presents the output stream at output ports <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Preferred Switching Device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a preferred switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The preferred switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a column-based reconfigurable switching matrix comprising a physical matrix <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a cross-connection controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is capable of simultaneously switching signals of multiple payload type and/or size. For example, the preferred switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is capable of simultaneously switching signals of multiple payload types such as simultaneously switching both SONET and SDH signals. The preferred switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is capable of simultaneously switching signals of multiple payload sizes such as simultaneously switching VT1.5 and VT2 signals. The preferred switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also capable of simultaneously switching signals of multiple payload types and sizes such as simultaneously switching SDH VC11 signals and SONET VT6 signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The preferred switching matrix <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is capable of switching on a column by column basis, which allows it to switch signals of multiple payload type and/or size. The preferred switching matrix <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> comprises a write engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a buffer or memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a read engine <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The write engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives traffic or payload from an input channel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and writes the payload or data to the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably in a sequential manner. The switching matrix <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> also preferably assigns a column address to each column of data written into the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The read engine <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> reads data from the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably on a channel by channel basis in a predetermined order and outputs the data via an output channel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to accomplish a time slot interchange (TSI) cross connection. The cross-connection controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> preferably provides the read engine <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> with the channel by channel order in which to read the data out of the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by providing the channel addresses in the order in which the channels are to be read. The channels are read out in a specific time slot to accomplish TSI cross-connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the cross-connection controller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably comprises some type of control hardware <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> such as a DSP although other devices such as a microprocessor, controller, micro-controller, programmable logic device, or others could be used. The control hardware <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with two input vectors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and generates an output vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> based on the input vectors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and its knowledge of the how the read engine <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> writes data into the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The first input vector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is a payload identification input vector. This vector contains information relating to the payload that is written into buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The switch matrix controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> performs its calculations based on a basic building block for the payload. The basic building block is the smallest basic payload size that is common to the types of signals that are to be switched. For the preferred switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which can switch both SDH and SONET signals, the basic building block is a STM-1 frame because it is the smallest higher order payload size that is common to both SDH and SONET. The payload identification input vector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> contains one or more payload identification blocks <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) wherein each payload identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> contains identification information for one basic building block slice (STM-1 frame slice in this example) of the payload that is stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The total number of payload identification blocks <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the payload identification input vector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is equal to the total number of payload building blocks needed to describe the entire payload in the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For example, for a switching device that can switch four STS-12 signals or 2.5 GBS, the payload identification input vector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> would contain 16 payload identification blocks <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) wherein each identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> would describe one STM-1 slice of payload. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An exemplary payload identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The payload identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is subdivided into a plurality of payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The number of payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is determined by the maximum number of possible lower rate signal groups that could be supported by the basic building block. In this example, because the basic building block is a STM-1 frame slice, the number of payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is 21 because the maximum number of lower rate signal groups that could be multiplexed into an STM-1 signal is 21 virtual tributary (VT) groups in the case of SONET or 21 tributary unit group level 2 (TUG-2) groups in the case of SDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> collectively describe the portion of the payload the payload identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> relates to. Not all of the payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may contain identification information. The first payload description channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> describes the first section of the relevant payload portion. The next payload description channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that has applicable identification information is determined based on the size of the last described payload section. For example, if the first payload description channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> identified the payload as a SDH STM-1 signal then none of the remaining payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in that payload identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> would have applicable information because the STM-1 signal would use the entire bandwidth that could be described by the payload identification block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. If the first payload description channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> identified the payload as a SONET STS-1 signal, then the next applicable payload description channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> would be payload description channel No. 8 because a STS-1 signal would use the bandwidth that could be described by payload description channels 1-7. If the first payload description channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> identified the payload as a SONET VT1.5 signal, then the next applicable payload description channel would be payload description channel No. 2 because a VT1.5 signal would be contained in a single lower rate signal group and each channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> represents the bandwidth for a signal group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The second input vector <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a connection point vector. The connection point vector <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> contains connection point information that identifies the time slot in which the payload sections identified by the payload identification blocks <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are to be outputted. The output of the switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be viewed as consisting of a plurality of time slots. Cross connection is accomplished by the switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by outputting a specific payload section that is received in the input channel in an appropriate time slot in the output channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The connection point vector <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> contains one or more connection point blocks <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. For example, for a switching device that can switch four STS-12 signals or 2.5 GBS, the connection point vector <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> would contain 16 connection point blocks <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) wherein each connection point block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> contains information for one basic building block slice (STM-1 frame size in this example) of the payload that is stored in buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each connection point block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of connection point block channels <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, the number of connection point block channels <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, being determined by the maximum number of possible virtual tributary groups (VTGs) or TUG-2 groups times the maximum number of virtual tributaries (VTs) or virtual containers (VCs) that could be supported by a VTG/TUG-2. In this example, each connection point block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> contains 84 connection point block channels <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> wherein each group of four channels correspond to a VTG/TUG-2. Therefore, there are 84 possible cross-connections out of an STM-1 slice of bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The output vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> preferably is an output column vector. The output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> preferably includes a plurality of column vector blocks <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. For example, for a switching device that can switch four STS-12 signals or 2.5 GBS, the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> would contain 16 column vector blocks <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) wherein each column vector block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> contains information for one basic building block slice (STM-1 frame slice in this example) of the payload that is stored in buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Each column vector block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of column vector block columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> wherein the number of column vector block columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is equal to the total number of columns in a buffer unit slice of payload. In this example there are 270 column vector block columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> because there are 270 columns of data in a STM-1 data frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> populates each column vector block column <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with a column address that corresponds to a column of data in buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The order of the column addresses in the column vector blocks <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines the order in which the columns of data are read out of buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As a column of data is read out of the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, it is assigned to the next output time slot. By determining the order in which the columns of data are read out of buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can determine the time slot each column of data is assigned to thereby controlling the time slot interchange the switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> performs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cross-connection controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> also preferably includes programming <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and lookup tables <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> that instruct the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on how to use the first and second input vectors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to perform the translation necessary to generate the output vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The translation from the payload description to the output column address sequence is preferably accomplished through the use of a couple of lookup table stages especially since the various payloads do not occupy consecutive column numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In operation, as payload is written into buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> examines the payload identification input vector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to determine the payload type/size for the incoming payload. The DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> then examines the connection point vector <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to determine how the payload is to be cross-connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If, for example, the first STM-1 slice of payload is described as an STM-1 slice, then the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> looks only at connection point block channel no.1 to identify the time slot in which this STM-1 slice is to be cross-connected to. After identifying the output time slot, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> determines the appropriate column address sequence needed to direct this STM-1 slice to its assigned output time slot and writes this column address sequence to the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at columns 1-270, in the appropriate column vector block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, if the first payload section in the first STM-1 slice is described as a STS-1 slice, then the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would look at connection block channel no. 1 to identify the time slot in which the STS-1 slice would be cross-connected to. After identifying the output time slot, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> determines the appropriate column address sequence needed to direct the STS-1 slice to its assigned output time slot and writes this column address sequence to the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in columns 1-90 in the appropriate column vector block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would next look at payload description channel no. 8 to find the description for the next slice of bandwidth within the STM-1 slice (because the prior STS-1 slice occupied payload description channel nos. 1-7). If this slice is also described as an STS-1 slice, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would look at connection block channel no. 29 to identify the time slot in which this STS-1 slice would be cross-connected to (because the prior STS-1 slice occupied connection block channel nos. 1-28). After identifying the output time slot, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> determines the appropriate column address sequence needed to direct the STS-1 slice to its assigned output time slot and writes this column address sequence to the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in columns 91-180 in the appropriate column vector block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would then look at payload description channel no. 15 to find the description for the next slice of bandwidth within the STM-1 slice (because the prior STS-1 slice occupied payload description channel nos. 8-14). If this slice is described as an VT-6 slice, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would look at connection block channel no. 57 to identify the time slot in which the VT-6 slice would be cross-connected to (because the prior STS-1 slice occupied connection block channel nos. 29-56). After identifying the output time slot, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> determines the appropriate column address sequence needed to direct the VT-6 slice to its assigned output time slot and writes this column address sequence to the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in columns 181-192. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would then look at payload description channel no. 16 to find the description for the next slice of bandwidth within the STM-1 slice (because the prior VT-6 slice occupied payload description channel no. 15). If this slice is also described as an VT-6 slice, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would look at connection block channel no. 61 to identify the time slot in which the VT-6 slice would be cross-connected to (because the prior VT-6 slice occupied connection block channel nos. 57-60). After identifying the output time slot, the DSP <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> determines the appropriate column address sequence needed to direct the VT-6 slice to its assigned output time slot and writes this column address sequence to the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in columns 193-204. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This process of examining the payload description channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and connection block channels <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, determining the appropriate column address sequence, and writing the column address sequence to the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is repeated until the remainder of the STM-1 bandwidth slice has been operated on. This process is performed for each STM-1 slice within the total payload in buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The read engine <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the hardware switch matrix <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> would then read out the columns from the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into the output channel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the appropriate output time slot based on the order provided in the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to accomplish the TSI switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> uses real SONET/SDH column numbering. An STM-1 is formed of 270 columns and therefore each STM-1 slice of payload requires 270 column vector block columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the output column vector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A VT1.5/VC11 signal would occupy 3 of those columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A VT2/VC12 would occupy 4 of those columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A VT3 would occupy 6 of those columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A VT6 would occupy 12 of those columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A STS-1/AU3 would occupy 90 of those columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. And, an STM-1/AU-4 would occupy all 270 of those columns <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also, the switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can generate AIS and UNEQ for all of the known payload types when AIS or UNEQ is to be injected, negative connection numbers are provided in the connection point vector to appropriately instruct the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> would cause AIS or UNEQ payload to be fetched from the AIS/UNEQ block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, instead of the TSI memory block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Some embodiments of the switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used to implement a multi-language, multi-service central cross-connect. Some embodiments are not specific to a certain payload language, or size, as long as it is column based (as SONET and SDH are). Some embodiments are easy to control from the software point of view, as its control mechanism deals with payload type, size and number, i.e. a direct representation of what the user would tell the matrix. And, in some embodiments, the complexity of the control is hidden by a hardware layer that translate payload descriptions into &ldquo;real work&rdquo;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Other variations from these systems and methods should become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the claims.
