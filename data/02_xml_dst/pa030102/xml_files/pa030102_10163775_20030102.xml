<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a combinatorial method and apparatus for making, screening, and characterizing materials wherein process conditions are controlled and monitored. More particularly, the invention relates to a parallel reactor system and a method of using the system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Chemical synthesis has historically been a slow and arduous process. With the advent of combinatorial methods, however, scientists can now create large libraries of compounds and materials at a much faster pace. Combinatorial methods refer to the techniques for creating a collection of chemically diverse compounds or materials using a relatively small set of precursors and for rapidly testing or screening the collection of compounds or materials for desirable performance characteristics and properties. Such techniques permit researchers to systematically explore the influence of structural variations in candidate compounds or materials by significantly accelerating the rates at which the candidates are created and evaluated. As compared to traditional methods, combinatorial methods can substantially reduce the cost of preparing and screening each candidate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One impact of combinatorial methods can be seen, for example, in pharmaceutical research where the process of drug discovery has been greatly improved. (See, e.g., 29 <highlight><italic>Acc. Chem. Res. </italic></highlight>1-170 (1996); 97 <highlight><italic>Chem. Rev. </italic></highlight>349-509 (1977); S. Borman, Chem. Eng. News 57-64 (Feb. 12, 1996); N. Terret, 1 <highlight><italic>Drug Discovery Today </italic></highlight>402 (1996)). In general, drug discovery can be viewed as a two-step process: (a) acquiring candidate compounds through laboratory synthesis or natural product collection; and (b) subsequent evaluation or screening for efficacy. In the second step, pharmaceutical researchers have long used high-throughput screening (HTS) protocols to rapidly evaluate the therapeutic value of natural products and compounds synthesized and cataloged over many years. The chemical synthesis step, on the other hand, has historically been a slow and arduous process compared to HTS protocols. With combinatorial methods, however, researchers can now synthesize large libraries of organic molecules at a pace that is more on par with HTS protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although combinatorial methods have also been successfully applied to drug research and discovery, they have not been widely used to study the influence of temperature, pressure, and other process conditions upon chemical reactions. For example, reaction conditions are important in synthetic chemistry and formulation chemistry. Investigation of the impact of reaction variables by traditional methods is time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to devise a method and apparatus for carrying out these reactions in a combinatorial fashion. Since numerous industrial processes are conducted in a constant pressure reactor, there is a need for a constant-pressure parallel reactor and a method of making and using the reactor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention provide a parallel reactor system and method for using the system. The parallel reactor system may be a constant volume or constant pressure system. Preferably, the system is a constant pressure system. The parallel reactor system may be used to screen multiple compounds or materials at the same time. Preferably, the reactor system includes at least one of: (1) a plurality of reactor vessels; (2) a plurality of selector valves; (3) a plurality of syringe pumps; (4) a drive system attached to the syringe pumps; (5) and a control unit connected to the drive system and the selector valves. Preferably, each reactor vessel has a transfer line connected thereto, and each selector valve is connected to a respective reactor vessel via the transfer line. Each syringe pump preferably contains a reagent and is selectively connected to a respective reactor vessel via a respective selector valve. Preferably, the reactor vessels are adapted to allow the pressure therein to remain at an approximately constant value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; or &ldquo;in parallel&rdquo; refer to events that take place or occur at the same time or substantially the same time; i.e., simultaneously or substantially simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the invention may be used to synthesize and/or screen heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts in the liquid phase, with or without a gas phase. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> generally illustrates a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to these embodiments. Starting materials <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for synthesizing the catalysts are measured using a balance <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and then placed in a plurality of reactor vessels, one of which is shown generally at <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, a weighing station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be use to securely hold the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, while a computer-controlled automated liquid handling system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a robotic arm may be used to pick up and transfer each reactor vessel to and from the balance <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to be weighed. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,045,671 and 6,175,409 disclose a robotic handling system which may be used in these embodiments of the invention. The disclosures of the two patents are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. In other embodiments, the handling of the starting material <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be done manually. The weighing station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may also be used to measure the weight of all the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> containing the starting materials <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may thereafter be removed from the weighing station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and placed in a solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in order to synthesize the catalysts. U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,430 discloses an exemplary solid phase synthesis unit which may be used in these embodiments of the invention. The disclosure of this patent is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. In some embodiments, the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can accommodate up to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> rows of <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> reactor vessels per row for a total of 48 reactor vessels. This arrangement advantageously allows up to 48 catalysts to be synthesized in parallel, thereby substantially reducing the amount of time required for synthesis and/or screening relative to a sequential process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> After the catalysts have been synthesized and/or dried, annealed, or otherwise treated and processed offline, the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be removed from the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and placed in a parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in order to screen and characterize the properties thereof. The parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, like the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, can accommodate 8 rows of 6 reactor vessels per row for a total of 48 reactor vessels. Thus, up to 48 heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts may be screened and characterized in parallel, thereby significantly reducing the amount of time required for screening and characterizing relative to a sequential process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that any number of reactor vessels may be used in parallel, for example, 12, 24, 56, 64, 72, 81, 100, 120, and so on. Sometimes, not all reactor vessels are used in conducting a reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> optionally may be used to sparge or otherwise introduce a reagent, preferably a gas or mixture of gases, into the reactor vessels. A different gas or mixture of gases may be sparged into each reactor vessel, or the same gas or mixture of gases may be sparged into several reactor vessels. In some embodiments, the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is capable of delivering the gas or mixture of gases to up to 48 reactor vessels in parallel or simultaneously. Thus, up to 48 different oxidation or other reaction processes may be carried out at the same time in the 48 reactor vessels, thereby greatly reducing the amount of time required to conduct 48 reactions in a sequential process. In some embodiments, the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is capable of delivering the gas mixtures to the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at the same or substantially the same gas flow rate, thereby ensuring a consistent flow of gas to all the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, in general, may be any container of a suitable shape and material for carrying out a reaction such as synthesizing the heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts and performing heterogeneously or homogeneously catalyzed reactions. In some embodiments, the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be threaded glass cylinders or vials as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, such a reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably has a mouth portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is open to the surrounding environment, a body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> connected thereto, and an open-bottom neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> connected to the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The mouth portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> together define a longitudinal flow path through the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The mouth portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, by virtue of being open to the surrounding environment, allows the pressure within the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to remain substantially the same as that of the surrounding environment. The mouth portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also facilitates easy placement and removal of reaction components into and out of the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In most cases, the reactor pressure is the atmospheric pressure, i.e., approximately 1 atm. In other embodiments, however the reactor pressure may be higher or lower than 1 atm, such as 0.5 atm, 1.5 atm, 2 atm, 10 atm, and so on. In that case, the reactor vessel may need to be modified to accommodate the higher or lower reactor pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> holds the heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts within the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the inner surface of the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be treated with dichlorodimethyl silane to render the surface hydrophobic. This is done to prevent the catalysts from adhering to the inner surface of the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has threads <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> on the outer surface for providing a threaded connection between the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as well as the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Mounted within the neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are a pair of elastomeric O-rings <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that support a removable filter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> therebetween. The two O-rings <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are themselves removable and are held in place, for example, by friction. Such an arrangement provides a fluid-tight seal between the inner surface of the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the filter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and prevents the filter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from turning or otherwise working loose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The filter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> serves to retain the heterogeneous catalysts and/or a liquid within the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> while allowing a gas to freely pass therethrough. In some embodiments, the filter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be made of a fritted glass, porous plastic (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, Teflon&trade;, hydrophilic polyethylene, PEEK, PEEK alloyed with Teflon&trade;, and the like), stainless steel, or filter paper. In general, however, any material having a porosity that can provide the described function may be used to form the filter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the invention wherein a filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is formed as an integral part of the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> instead of as a separate removable component. Such an arrangement may not only be more convenient, but may also ensure there are no gaps or space between the filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the invention wherein a filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is disposed under the open-bottom neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. An elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is placed underneath the filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> as shown such that the filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are resting on top of the elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. As such, the filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is securely held in place by the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be made of any of the filter materials mentioned above. If filter paper is used for the filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, the filter paper is preferably Whatman No. 1, available from Whatman plc, Whatman House, St. Leonard&apos;s Road, 20/20 Maidstone, Kent, ME16 OLS, U.K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Note in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C that the neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is shown as narrower than the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> only to emphasize the distinction therebetween, and that the invention is not to be limited thereto. In general, the specific diameters, lengths, and/or ratios thereof for the mouth portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and neck portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be any number and can be chosen as needed for a particular application. Preferably, the aspect ratio, i.e., the height over the diameter, of the body portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> should be relatively large. For example, it should be at least 1, preferably 2, 3, 4, or 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may simply be a straight glass or metal tube without threads. In that case, a gas tight seal may be provided by a compression fitting (not expressly shown) that fits on the outside of the tube. The filter may then be a disc that is pressed into the compression fitting against the bottom of the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Once preparation of the starting materials <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> have been completed, the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> containing the starting materials are placed in the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in order to synthesize the heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> according to some embodiments of the invention. As can be seen, the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a reactor block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for housing the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> attached thereto for securely mounting the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> therein. Locking clips or clamps <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and an elastomeric member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> clamp the substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to a plenum <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and serve to create a gas tight seal therebetween. Such a gas tight seal allows the plenum <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to be subsequently evacuated as needed for vacuum filtration of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A robotic shaker <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> such as an orbital shaker is attached to the plenum <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and is operable to shake the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to thereby agitate the contents of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the robotic shaker <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be configured to return to a &ldquo;home&rdquo; or reset position to facilitate addition of reagents to the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by the automated liquid handler <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The reactor block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of reactor wells, defined by the well walls <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, for receiving the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A cooling zone <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, an insulation layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and a heating zone <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> surround each one of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the reactor block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and may be used to heat and cool the heterogeneous catalysts in the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as needed for synthesis thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of threaded bores, defined by the bore walls <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, into which the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be screwed in order to ensure a secure mount therefor. A person having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other mounting means besides a threaded connection may be used to mount the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, an elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may be disposed at the bottom of each one of the threaded bores to form a gas tight seal between the substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Where the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the elastomeric O-rings <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may take the place of the elastomeric O-rings <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At any time during or after the synthesis reaction, a vacuum may be created in the space between the plenum <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for vacuum filtration of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Liquids that may be present in the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are then suctioned by the force of the vacuum through drains <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> protruding through the bottom of the substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and collected in a plurality of collection vials <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The collection vials <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> are held in a removable rack <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> that may be removed by unlocking the locking clamps <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and lifting off the substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the reactor block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> After the heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts have been synthesized, the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are removed from the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and transferred to the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for screening and characterizing of the heterogeneous catalysts. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> according to some embodiments of the invention. Like the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> also has a reactor block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> attached to a substrate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for housing the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In addition, the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> also has a selector valve housing <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> that houses a plurality of valves which facilitate selection between delivery of a gas mixture to, or removal of unwanted fluids from, the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Locking clips or clamps <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and an elastomeric member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> clamp the selector valve housing <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to a plenum <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to create a gas tight seal therebetween. A robotic shaker <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> such as an orbital shaker having the &ldquo;home&rdquo; or reset feature is attached to the plenum <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and may be used to agitate the contents of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The reactor block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of reactor wells, defined by the well walls <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, similar to the reactor wells in the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) for receiving the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Likewise, a cooling zone <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, an insulation layer <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, and a heating zone <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may be operated to heat and cool the catalysts in the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the parallel reactor unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of threaded bores, defined by the bore walls <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, into which the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be screwed (similar to the ones in the solid phase synthesis unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). An elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> is also available, in some embodiments, in the threaded bores for forming a gas tight seal between the substrate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Where the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the elastomeric O-rings <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> may take the place of the elastomeric O-rings <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A plurality of transfer lines <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, one for each reactor vessel, connect the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to respective ones of a plurality of selector valves <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> mounted in the selector valve housing <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Each selector valve <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> connects the respective reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> either to a delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> extending from the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through an opening in the selector valve housing, or to a removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> extending through the bottom of the selector valve housing into the plenum <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Because each transfer line <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> may be connected to a separate delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> (via the selector valve <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>), each reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> consequently may receive a separate mixture of gas from the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> After oxidation or other reaction in the presence of a catalyst has been completed, a vacuum may be created in the space between the plenum <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> for vacuum filtration of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Any liquids that may be present in the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at this time are suctioned through the removal lines <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and collected in the respective collection vials <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. As in the solid phase synthesis unit, the collection vials <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> are held in a removable rack <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> that may be taken out after unlocking the locking clamps <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and lifting off the substrate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the reactor block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a close-up cross-sectional view of the selector valve <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> according to some embodiments of the invention. As can be seen, the transfer line <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to/from the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be connected to either the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> from the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, or the removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> that drains into the collection vial <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. Selection between the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> is controlled by valve actuators <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which open and close the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, respectively. In general, any type of mechanical valve may be used for the selector valve <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, but preferably the valve actuators <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are solenoid-controlled valve actuators. Such solenoid valves are commercially available from, for example, E. Clark Associates, 55 Green Street, Clinton, Mass. 01510. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In operation, when a gas mixture is to be delivered to the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the valve actuators <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are controlled to open the path to the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and close the path to the removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, respectively, thereby connecting the transfer line <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. When delivery of the gas mixture is completed, the valve actuators <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are controlled to close the path to the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and open the path to the removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, respectively, thereby connecting the transfer line <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to the removal line <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Delivery of the gas or mixture of gases is accomplished by the use of the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a cross-sectional view of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, according to some embodiments of the invention. As can be seen, the injection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes a syringe plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, the opposing sides of which are mounted to a threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and supported by a ball <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> that is threadedly engaged with the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. A stepper motor <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is attached to the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and may be configured to rotate the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in predefined increments or steps. By rotating the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the ball <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may be moved up and/or down to multiple positions along the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in precisely controlled increments. Hence, the syringe plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may also be moved up or down to multiple positions along the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. Such an arrangement is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;ball-and-screw&rdquo; drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while the ball-and-screw drive is an effective way to deliver the gas mixtures to the reactor vessels, the invention is not to be limited thereto. In general, any drive system that is capable of performing the described function may be used. For example, instead of a ball-and-screw drive, a hydraulic drive may be used in some embodiments, or a spring based drive system, or a latch and gear based system such as the one disclosed in published PCT Application WO 00/32308 which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The syringe plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is in turn attached to a plurality of plungers <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> that are slidingly engaged with a plurality of syringes <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> which hold the gas mixtures to be delivered to the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the syringe plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is raised and/or lowered to the various positions by the operation of the ball-and-screw drive, the plurality of plungers <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are also raised and/or lowered accordingly. In some embodiments, the plungers <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are all approximately of the same length, and the syringes <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> are all approximately of the same width and height relative to one another. Such an arrangement advantageously allows the gas mixtures contained in the syringes <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> to be delivered to each reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> under the same or substantially the same gas flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A syringe block <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> houses the plurality of the syringes <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and includes a cooling zone <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and a heating zone <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> for cooling and heating the gas mixtures as needed. The delivery lines <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, as described earlier, connect a respective one of the plurality of syringes <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> to a respective one of the reactor vessels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The syringes <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> are further connected via a plurality of pass lines <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> to a respective one of a plurality of control valves <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. Each of the control valves <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> is in turn connected to one of the delivery lines <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and a supply line <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. The control valves <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> control the flow of gases out of and into the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> via the delivery lines <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the supply lines <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each supply line <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> is connected to a respective one of a plurality of supply valves <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. The supply valves <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> open and close a plurality of gas lines <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> to provide gas into the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. A valve block <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> houses the plurality of control valves <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and supply valves <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, and has openings formed therein for accommodating the routing of the delivery lines <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and gas lines <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a close-up cross-sectional view of the syringe pump assembly according to some embodiments of the invention. As can be seen, a plunger head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is attached to one end of the plunger <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> within the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and preferably forms a gas tight and liquid tight seal with the inner surface of the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The plunger head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may be raised and/or lowered to multiple positions as needed in precise increments by the raising and/or lowering of the plunger <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> (the movement of which is controlled by the syringe plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> via operation of the ball-and-screw drive). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A plurality of control valve actuators <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> control the selection of whether the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> or the supply line <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> is open. In general, when either one of the delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> or supply line <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> is open, the other one is closed. A plurality of supply valve actuators <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> control the selection of the particular gas lines <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> that supply gas into the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. In general, any type of valves may be used, but preferably the control valve actuators <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and the supply valve actuators <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> are solenoid-controlled valve actuators similar to the valve actuators <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> discussed previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In operation, the plunger head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is raised to a preselected position to prepare the gas mixture to be delivered to the reactor vessel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The raising of the plunger head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> creates a slight vacuum pressure in the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> to draw the gas or mixture of gases into the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The delivery line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is closed and the supply line <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> is opened during this time via a respective one of the control valves <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. One or possibly several of the supply valve actuators <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> in the supply valve <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> are thereafter opened, and the desired gas or gases flows through the pass line <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> into the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The desired gas or gases should be allowed to flow for a sufficient time period to fill the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> up to the plunger head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. The plunger head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may then be pulled back to another predetermined position and additional/different gases may flow into the syringe <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> by opening one or more supply valve actuators <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>.

As can be seen, a method <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, according to some embodiments of the invention, begins by expanding the syringe pump to a predefined volume at step <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> by, for example, operating the transfer drive (e.g., ball-and-screw drive) to raise the syringe plate to a desired position. At step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, the syringe pump is filled with a desired gas or mixture of gases by, for example, controlling the appropriate valve actuators to open the desired gas lines. At step <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether additional gas or mixture of gases are to be added to the syringe pumps. If the answer is yes, then the expanding and filling steps <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> are repeated. If the answer is no, a flow path is opened between the syringe pumps and the reactor vessels at step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> by, for example, controlling the appropriate valve actuators to open the delivery lines (and close the removal lines). The syringe pumps are thereafter compressed to deliver the gas or mixture of gases to the reactor vessels at step <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> by, for example, controlling the transfer drive to lower the syringe plate. Finally, the flow path is closed between the syringe pumps and the reactor vessels at step <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> (via the appropriate valve actuators) and the method may be repeated or ended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Note that the above process allows any number of different gas mixtures to be created in parallel. For example, assume the syringes have a volume of 100 ml, and a gas mixture containing 50% oxygen and 50% nitrogen is to be prepared in one syringe, while another gas mixture containing 25% oxygen and 75% nitrogen is to be prepared in a second syringe. Both mixtures of gas may be prepared by raising the plunger head in each syringe at the same time (via the syringe plate) to three different positions: 25 ml, 50 ml, and 100 ml. The 25 ml position allows both syringes to be filled with 25 ml of oxygen. The oxygen line is then kept open to the first syringe and closed off to the second syringe, and the nitrogen line is opened to the second syringe. The plunger heads are then moved to the 50 ml position, which allows the first syringe to be filled an additional 25 ml of oxygen while the second syringe is filled with 25 ml of nitrogen. The oxygen line is then closed to the first syringe and the nitrogen line is opened thereto. The plunger head is then raised to the 100 ml position and the remainder of both syringes is filled with nitrogen (50 ml). Through this incremental process, the two syringes now contain their intended gas mixtures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates, in a general sense, a method <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> of using a constant pressure parallel reactor system according to some embodiments of the invention. At step <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, the starting material for the heterogeneous catalysts or other reaction components are prepared by, for example, measuring and placing them in the reactor vessels. The reaction components are thereafter synthesized and/or otherwise treated at step <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, for example, in a solid phase synthesis unit. Gas mixtures are prepared at step <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, preferably each reactor vessel receiving a different mixture of gases, or several reactor vessels receiving the same mixture of gases. At step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, the gas flow rate at which the gas mixtures will be delivered is specified, and the gas mixtures are thereafter delivered to the reactor vessels at step <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the gas delivery step should be repeated. If the answer is no, then the method is ended. If the answer is yes, then the method returns to the gas preparation step <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> for additional preparation of the gas mixtures as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The same gas flow rate may be specified for each gas delivery step, or a different flow rate may be used for some gas delivery steps. Also, a varying (increasing/decreasing) flow rate may be used within a single gas delivery step instead of a constant flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that possible embodiments of the invention are not limited only to those described herein. For example, the continuous feed parallel reactor system and various components thereof disclosed in PCT Application WO 00/32308 may be used to practice method of the invention with some modifications. Similarly, the reactors disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,288,468 and 6,149,882 may also be used to implement embodiments of the invention. All of the preceding references are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> If desired, an in situ detection mechanism may be added to various embodiments of the invention to further increase efficiency. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,959,297, 6,034,775, 6,087,181, 6,151,123, 6,157,449, 6,175,409 and 6,182,499 disclose various detection mechanisms which may be used in embodiments of the invention with or without modifications. All of the preceding U.S. patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Many different types of reactions can be studied in parallel using the apparatus and methods described herein, including carbonylation, hydroformylation, oxidation, reduction, hydroxycarbonylation, hydrocarbonylation, hydroesterification, hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydroamination, epoxidation, aziridination, reductive amination, C&mdash;H activation, insertion, C&mdash;H activation-insertion, C&mdash;H activation-substitution, C-halogen activation, C-halogen activation-substitution, C-halogen activation-insertion, cyclopropanation, alkene metathesis, alkyne metathesis and polymerization reactions of all sort, including alkene oligomerization, alkene polymerization, alkyne oligomerization, alkyne polymerization, co-polymerization, CO-alkene co-oligomerization, CO-alkene co-polymerization, CO-alkyne co-oligomerication, CO-alkyne co-polymerization, coordination polymerizations, cationic polymerizations and free radical polymerizations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Most of the reactions may be carried out in semi-continuous or continuous processes, where one or more reagents is metered into the process reactor at a controlled rate. Other processes are conducted in a continuous manner, where reagents are metered into the process reactor at a controlled rate, while products are removed from the reactor. It is frequently important to screen candidate catalysts, materials, and processes under realistic process conditions. Many catalytic reactions proceed most favorably when one or more reagents is maintained at a low concentration during the course of the reaction. Semi-continuous and continuous processes allow such conditions to be established, if the rate of reagent is consumed in the reactor at a rate comparable or faster than the rate at which it is introduced. Semi-continuous and continuous processes also allow for efficient use of industrial reactor capacity, since the final concentration of products can be much higher than the instantaneous concentration of starting materials during the course of the reaction. Also, semi-continuous and continuous processes are readily controlled, because the rate of heat release is limited by the rate of reagent addition to the reactor. Semi-continuous and continuous processes can add the reagents more slowly than the rate of reaction, so that the instantaneous concentration of reagents is low throughout the process, but so that the concentration of product from the reactor is high. Reactions that benefit from this mode include cyclization reactions to form medium- and large-sized rings, reactions where one or more of the reagents is prone to unwanted self-reaction or polymerization, and catalytic processes where one or more reagents acts as an inhibitor to the catalyst. Furthermore, semi-continuous and continuous processes may allow for the production of more chemically uniform copolymers because the process can occur with a low concentration of monomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Emulsions polymerization processes produce polymer dispersions or colloids, typically of small polymer particles in water stabilized by surfactant. Such colloids are frequently unstable in the presence of organic solvents or molecules, such as monomers. Semi-continuous and continuous process can produce emulsions with the slow addition of monomer, because the monomer concentration is maintained very low during the process. Also, semi-continuous and continuous processes allow unstable, highly reactive reagents, such as thermal initiators, to be metered throughout the course of the process, so that useful concentrations of the reagent is maintained until the reaction is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Any form of catalysts may be used in embodiments of the invention. They include, but are not limited to, homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts, phase-transfer catalysts, and arrays of catalysts. It should be understood that embodiments of the invention may also be used to study those reactions which do not require a catalyst. In addition, embodiments of the invention may be carried out according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,985,356, 6,004,617, 6,030,197, 6,149,882, and 6,187,164, which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As demonstrated above, embodiments of the invention provide a parallel reactor system and method therefor wherein mixtures of gas may be sparged into the reactor vessels. The parallel reactor system allows a plurality of heterogeneous reactions, including gas, liquid, and solid phases, to be conducted in a combinatorial manner. Moreover, specific mixtures of gas may be prepared and delivered in parallel to each of the reactor vessels. As such, the parallel reactor may significantly speed up research and development cycles. Additional advantages provided by the embodiments of the invention are apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> While a limited number of embodiments of the invention have been described, these embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as otherwise described and claimed herein. Variations and modifications from the described embodiments exist. For example, in some embodiments, instead of using open-ended reactor vessels wherein the pressure remains the same as the surrounding environment (e.g., 1 atmosphere), vent needles or other pressure control means may be used to maintain the pressure at a different value. In other embodiments, rather than injecting the gas mixtures through the bottom of the reactor vessels, a different injection point such as from the side or top of the reactor vessels may be used. In still other embodiments, instead of using syringes that are approximately all the same size to achieve a consistent flow rate relative to all syringes, different size syringes may be used to achieve different flow rates for each syringe. Moreover, unless otherwise specified, the steps of the methods described may be practiced in any order or sequence. Furthermore, some steps may be omitted, combined into a single step, or divided into several sub-steps. All numbers disclosed herein are approximate values regardless of whether that term was used in describing the numbers. Accordingly, the appended claims are intended to cover all such variations and modifications as falling within the scope of the invention.</paragraph>
