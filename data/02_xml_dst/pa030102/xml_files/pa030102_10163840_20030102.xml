<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Fluorinated peroxides have been reported to be useful in a variety of areas of organic synthesis. Fluorinated peroxides manifest unique properties, which are attractive not just for fundamental, but also for applied chemistry. For example, this class of peroxides can be used as active radical initiators for the polymerization of halogenated olefins and as reagents for perfluoroalkylation of polymers and monomers. It has been reported that even polymeric hydrocarbon materials can be perfluorinated with fluorinated peroxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Fluorinated peroxides have commonly been prepared by the reaction of perfluoroacyl chlorides or anhydrides with hydrogen peroxide under basic aqueous conditions. This method suffers from the hydrolysis and loss of starting reagents (e.g., perfluoroacyl chlorides and/or anhydrides) as well as loss of hydrolyzable products (e.g., bis(perfluoroacyl) peroxides). The formation of salt by-products in this method is also undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Numerous attempts have been devoted to developing improved methods for preparing fluorinated peroxides. Despite the attempts, convenient methods for preparing fluorinated peroxides for laboratory and/or industrial applications are desired in the art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a composition including a perfluorinated peroxide of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>. The method includes combining a perfluorinated anhydride of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>with hydrogen peroxide and a secondary reagent (preferably a catalyst) to form the composition including the perfluorinated peroxide R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>, wherein each R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>group is independently a perfluorinated aromatic or aliphatic group, or combinations thereof, optionally including oxygen atoms. The secondary reagent is a salt, a metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, a metal alcoholate, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the secondary reagent is a salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the perfluorinated peroxide of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>the R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>groups independently represent a perfluorinated aromatic group, a perfluorinated straight chain, branched, or cyclic aliphatic group, or combinations thereof, and R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>may optionally include oxygen atoms. Preferably each R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>independently represents a perfluorinated aliphatic group optionally including oxygen atoms. More preferably, R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>includes 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Most preferably, R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>represents a perfluorinated aliphatic group having the formula C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>2n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>, where n is preferably an integer from 1 to 18, and more preferably 1 to 10. The term &ldquo;independently&rdquo; means that the two R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>groups may be the same or different in any one perfluorinated peroxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Perfluorinated anhydrides of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>are generally available through methods well known in the art and are commercially available from sources such as Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo. For example, R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>may be prepared by reacting ketene with perfluorocarboxylic acid as disclosed, for example, in International Publication No. WO 01/17939. The R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>groups are as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Aqueous hydrogen peroxide is commercially available at up to about 50% by weight from chemical suppliers (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). Higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can be obtained if desired. For example, 95% by weight H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be prepared by a well-known procedure disclosed in Pizey, S. J. Synthetic Reagents; John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1985; Vol.6, p 60. Typically, higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are desired to produce higher concentrations of R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>. Preferably the hydrogen peroxide is used as an aqueous solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The molar ratio of perfluorinated anhydride to hydrogen peroxide depends on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. For example, if 100% hydrogen peroxide is used, a preferred ratio of a perfluorinated anhydride to hydrogen peroxide is 2 to form perfluorinated anhydride in perfluorinated acid. If a solution of hydrogen peroxide in water is used, more perfluorinated anhydride typically is added to get rid of the water and form a solution of perfluorinated peroxide in perfluorinated acid. Based on 100% hydrogen peroxide, if the molar ratio of a perfluorinated anhydride to hydrogen peroxide is less than 2 but more then 1 (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the products are perfluorinated acid, perfluorinated peracid, and perfluorinated peroxide. If the molar ratio of perfluorinated anhydride to hydrogen peroxide is 1 or less than 1, the products are perfluorinated acid, perfluorinated peracid, and hydrogen peroxide. If the molar ratio of perfluorinated anhydride to hydrogen peroxide is more than 2, the products are perfluorinated acid, perfluorinated peroxide, and perfluorinated anhydride. Thus, a preferred range of ratios of perfluorinated anhydride to hydrogen peroxide, based on 100% hydrogen peroxide, is about 1.5 to about 10, and a more preferred range of ratios is about 1.75 to about 3.25. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is believed that the process of the reaction between a perfluorinated anhydride and hydrogen peroxide can be represented by the following two consecutive reactions, 1 and 2 (although these are not necessarily limiting to the present invention): </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is also within the scope of the present invention to combine a perfluorinated anhydride of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>with a mixture (preferably a solution) of a perfluorinated peracid (preferably a perfluorocarboxylic peracid of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOH) in a perfluorinated acid (preferably a perfluorocarboxylic acid of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOH) in the presence of a salt, metal oxide, metal hydroxide, metal alcoholate, and/or combinations thereof, to obtain the perfluorinated peroxide of the formula R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)OOC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>(e.g., bis(perfluoroacyl) peroxide). In this embodiment, the R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>groups are as defined above. In this embodiment, the ratios of perfluorinated anhydride to perfluorinated peracid (and perfluorinated acid) are from 0.1:1 to 100:1, and more preferably about 1:1. A solution of a perfluorocarboxylic peracid in a corresponding perfluorinated acid can be prepared by a well-known procedure described, for example, in P. A. Krasutsky et al., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>2000, 65, 3926. A preferred solution includes a concentration of perfluorocarboxylic peracid in perfluorinated carboxylic acid of about 0.0001% by weight (i.e., wt-%)) to about 100% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, a catalytic amount a salt, a metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, a metal alcoholate, or a combination thereof is combined with the perfluorinated anhydride and the hydrogen peroxide (or the perfluorinated anhydride, perfluorinated peracid, and perfluorinated acid). A catalytic amount, as used herein, is less than 2.5 mole %, preferably at most about 1 mole %, more preferably at most about 0.5 mole %, and most preferably at most about 0.1 mole %, based on moles of hydrogen peroxide. A catalytic amount, as used herein, is preferably at least about 0.0001 mole %, more preferably at least about 0.001 mole %, and most preferably at least about 0.01 mole %, based on moles of hydrogen peroxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a catalytic amount, as used herein, is less than 5 mole %, preferably at most about 2.5 mole %, more preferably at most about 1 mole %, and most preferably at most about 0.5 mole %, based on moles of perfluorinated anhydride.

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in the preparation of bis(trifluoroacetyl) peroxide, Japanese Patent Application No. 1-249752 (Sawada et al.) discloses the use of 2.5 to 6000 mole % of sodium and/or potassium carbonate, based on moles of hydrogen peroxide, and 5 to 300 mole % of sodium and/or potassium carbonate, based on moles of trifluoroacetic anhydride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Salts useful in the present invention include both inorganic and organic salts. Preferably, the salt includes, for example, a Group IA (e.g., Li, Na, etc.), a Group IIA (Be, Mg, etc.), or a Group IIIA (e.g., Al, Ga, etc.) cation (e.g., currently referred to as Groups 1, 2, and 13 of the Periodic Table). More preferred cations include, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, cesium, strontium, magnesium, aluminum, or combinations thereof. Useful salts may include an organic and/or inorganic anion. Preferably, the salt is a source of a basic anion. Preferred inorganic anions include, for example, sulfate, nitrate, halide, phosphate, silicate, borate, or combinations thereof. Preferred organic ions include, for example, carboxylates (e.g., carboxylates, perfluorocarboxylates). Preferably the carboxylate is an acetate (e.g., acetate, trifluoroacetate), a propionate, a butyrate, an iso-butyrate, or combinations thereof. The carboxylate can be a salt of a saturated fatty acid if desired. In some embodiments of the present invention, the salt is a non-carbonate salt (i.e., the salt does not include carbonate anions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Metal oxides useful in the present invention have the formula M<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>, wherein M is a metal, x&equals;1 to 2, and y&equals;1 to 3. Preferred metals (M) include those in Groups IA, IIA, and IIIA (current Groups 1, 2, and 13) of the Periodic Table. More preferred metals include, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, cesium, strontium, magnesium, aluminum, or combinations thereof. Preferred metal oxides include, for example, lithium oxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Metal hydroxides useful in the present invention preferably have the formula M(OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, wherein M is a metal and z&equals;1 to 3. Preferred metals (M) include those in Groups IA, IIA, and IIIA (current Groups 1, 2, and 13) of the Periodic Table. More preferred metals include, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, cesium, strontium, magnesium, aluminum, or combinations thereof. Preferred metal hydroxides include, for example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Metal alcoholates useful in the present invention have the formula M(OR)<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, wherein M is a metal and x&equals;1 to 3. Preferred metals (M) include those in Groups IA, IIA, and IIIA (current Groups 1, 2, and 13) of the Periodic Table. More preferred metals include, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, cesium, strontium, magnesium, aluminum, or combinations thereof. Preferred metal alcoholates include, for example, lithium methylate, lithium ethylate, lithium isopropylate, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, sodium isopropylate, potassium methylate, potassium ethylate, potassium isopropylate, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the salt, metal oxide, metal hydroxide, metal alcoholate, and/or combinations thereof may function as efficient basic catalysts because of the higher nucleophilicity of perfluorocarboxylate ion (R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C(O)O<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) compared to the corresponding perfluorocarboxylic acid. Rapid ion exchange in perfluorocarboxylic acid may also facilitate the catalytic activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the perfluorinated anhydride, the hydrogen peroxide, and the salt, metal oxide, metal hydroxide, metal alcoholate, or combination thereof are combined, they preferably form a single phase system. As used herein, a single phase system means that there are no perceptible phase separation lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The reactions described above can be carried out within a wide range of temperatures as desired. Preferably, the temperature is at most about 40&deg; C., more preferably at most about 30&deg; C. Preferably, the temperature is at least about &minus;45&deg; C., more preferably at least about &minus;20&deg; C., and most preferably at least about 20&deg; C. The reaction may be run in air or under an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that air and moisture be excluded from the composition including the perfluorinated peroxide if the composition is to be stored for extended periods of time. Organic solvents can be added to the composition to adjust the concentration of the perfluorinated peroxide as desired, but typically the reaction mixture and resultant product composition are substantially free of organic solvents. If used, inert organic solvents, such as freons or solvents of the formula C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>, where x&equals;1-10, n&equals;0-24, m&equals;0-24, y&equals;0-12, are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the perfluorinated peroxide is formed in a yield of at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, even more preferably at least about 98%, and most preferably at least about 100%, based on the amount of active oxygen. As used herein, the amount of &ldquo;active oxygen&rdquo; refers to the moles of hydrogen peroxide (or moles of perfluorinated peracid (e.g., perfluorcarboxylic peracid) for embodiments in which hydrogen peroxide is not used). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the present invention, the composition including the perfluorinated peroxide may be formed as a non-aqueous composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the composition including the perfluorinated peroxide may also include a perfluorinated acid, preferably trifluoroacetic acid. The perfluorinated acid can be removed before the composition is used, or the composition can be used as produced. The composition including the perfluorinated peroxide and the perfluorinated acid may have improved stability over other compositions including perfluorinated peroxides. For example, bis(trifluoroacetic) peroxide (BTFAP) manifests high stability in trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA). As evidence of this, the concentration of a 28% solution of BTFAP in TFAA remained essentially unchanged (26.5%) at &minus;10&deg; C. for 6 months. It is known, that the stability of other bis(perfluoroacyl) peroxides might be lower, but they are also sufficiently stable for industrial/laboratory safe operations when maintained at &minus;10&deg; C. in the corresponding perfluorinated acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Perfluorinated peroxides are useful, for example, for fluorinating organic compounds with R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>groups as defined above (e.g., perfluoroalkylate, perfluoroarylate). For example, a composition including a perfluoroalkyl peroxide may be combined with an organic compound to perfluoroalkylate the organic compound. Preferred methods involve perfluorinating the organic compound. When the organic compound is a polymerizable organic compound, the fluorination may initiate a polymerization reaction of the organic compound. Other methods in which bis(perfluoroacyl) peroxides, for example, are useful include methods described in H. Sawada, <highlight><italic>Chem. Rev., </italic></highlight>1996, 96, 1779-1808. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides a peroxide of the formula RC(O)OOC(O)R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>.

The perfluorocarboxylic peracid could be used as a solution in a corresponding perfluorinated acid. A useful temperature range for the preparation of these compounds is about &minus;50&deg; C. to about &plus;30&deg; C. (depending on the stability of the perfluorinated peroxides). The molar ratio of the carboxylic acid to the perfluorocarboxylic anhydride is preferably about 1:1 to about 1:20, and more preferably about 1:6. The molar ratio of the carboxylic acid to the perfluorocarboxylic peracid is preferably about 1:0.5 to about 1:10, and more preferably about 1:1. A solution of a perfluorocarboxylic peracid in a corresponding perfluorinated acid can be prepared by a well-known procedure described, for example, in P. A. Krasutsky et al., <highlight><italic>J.
