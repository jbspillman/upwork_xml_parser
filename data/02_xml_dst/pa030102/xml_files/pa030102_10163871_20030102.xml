<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to receivers, and more particularly, to a receiver with equalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A conventional receiver includes multiple receiver components, some of which may be used to overcome signal impairments. Some of the components may implement a carrier tracking loop. The carrier tracking loop tracks differences between transmit and receive carrier frequencies and/or phases. Because a carrier tracking loop having a short loop delay is usually considered to have better performance than a loop with a long loop delay, it can be beneficial to close the loop closer to an end of the receiver. However, this arrangement can result in an undesirable interaction between the tracking loop and other receiver components. Thus, the arrangement can disadvantageously reduce the effectiveness and/or adaptability of some or all of these other receiver components. This may disadvantageously increase receiver acquisition time and reduce receiver Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) performance. There is a need therefore for a receiver arrangement that overcomes these disadvantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention is a receiver including a filter stage including one or more adaptive and/or static pre-filters, a carrier loop, and an equalization loop. The equalization loop includes an adaptive equalizer. The present invention decouples an interaction between the carrier loop, the pre-filters, and the equalizer using a technique referred to as &ldquo;remodulation.&rdquo; The architecture of the present invention is more stable and significantly faster than conventional architectures. For example, the present invention improves receiver acquisition time and SNR performance compared to conventional receivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention is a receiver for processing a received signal, the received signal includes symbols and a frequency offset from baseband. The receiver includes a carrier tracking loop for generating an estimate of the frequency offset. The receive includes a filter stage for filtering the received signal to produce a filtered signal, whereby the filter introduces inter-symbol interference (ISI) in the filtered signal. A converter converts the filtered signal to a baseband signal that is substantially free of the frequency offset and the ISI, responsive to the frequency-offset estimate and a restorative signal that compensates for the ISI. A detector detects the symbols in the baseband signal to produce a decision signal. A restorative signal generator generates, from the decision signal, the restorative signal responsive to the frequency-offset estimate, such that the restorative signal compensates for the ISI. The restorative signal generator is referred to as a decisional feedback equalizer (DFE) with remodulation. Further embodiments of the present invention are described below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an example receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> processes a received signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary arrangement, signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes data packets spaced apart in time from each other, and referred to as data bursts. Each of the data packets includes a series of Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) symbols to be demodulated by receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may relate to a multiple user cable television (CATV) broadband communication system, for example. Typically, signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes an undesired frequency offset (and/or phase offset) representative of a difference in frequency (and/or phase) between a reference oscillator in a transmitter that originated signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (not shown) and a reference oscillator associated with receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, for example). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also, signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include interference, such as ingress, to be reduced by receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a filter stage <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In filter stage <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a pre-filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> filters signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so as to reduce the above-mentioned interference, and produces a filtered signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. For example, filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be an adaptive notch filter that notches-out a relatively narrowband interferer. Also in filter stage <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an equalizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, such as a feed-forward equalizer (FFE), equalizes signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to produce a filtered, equalized signal <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (also referred to as a filtered signal <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). Typically, filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> corrupts the frequency spectrum of signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, thus causing substantial ISI in filtered signals <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Filter stage <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may include more or less filters than are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and different types of filters from those described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (which may be a frequency mixer) frequency-shifts filtered signal <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> toward baseband by an amount approximately equal to the undesired frequency offset, responsive to a frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In an example arrangement, baseband corresponds to zero &ldquo;0&rdquo; Hz. Multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> produces an intermediate signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at or near baseband, that is, substantially free of the frequency offset, but that includes the ISI. A combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, such as a signal adder, combines intermediate signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with a restorative signal <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is intended to compensate for the ISI. Thus, combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> produces a baseband signal <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that is substantially free of the undesired frequency offset and some of the ISI. Often, much of the ISI disadvantageously remains in baseband signal <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, as will be illustrated below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, also referred to as a &ldquo;slicer&rdquo; <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, detects, for example, makes decisions on, the symbols in baseband signal <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> produces a baseband decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> including the detected symbols. A DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> generates the restorative signal <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> based on decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> operates as a filter equalizer that filters an input signal (in this case, decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>) based on filter coefficients, also referred to as weighting coefficients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> estimates the frequency offset, that is, generates a frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; representative of the undesired frequency offset, based at least in part on decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> generates correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> such that it has a frequency equal to frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;. For example, carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may generate correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> as a series of samples of a complex sinusoidal signal represented by the term e<highlight><superscript>&minus;j&ohgr;n</superscript></highlight>, where n is a time index indicating the n<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>sample of signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be continuous-time signal represented by the term e<highlight><superscript>&minus;j&ohgr;t</superscript></highlight>, where t represents time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> forms part of a carrier tracking loop (also referred to herein as a carrier loop) of receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, including multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The carrier loop tracks and corrects for the undesired frequency offset. Specifically, multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> frequency-shifts filtered signal <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> toward baseband by an amount equal to frequency &ohgr; of correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Thus, multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> frequency-shifts filtered signal <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> toward baseband based on, that is, responsive to, frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes a decisional feedback equalizing (or equalizer) loop including combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The decisional feedback equalizing loop attempts to correct for the ISI mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the above-mentioned carrier loop corrects, that is substantially removes, the frequency offset prior to DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (and the DFE loop). An appropriate choice of architecture and filter coefficients for filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> allows DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to nearly perfectly compensate for the inter-symbol interference (ISI) introduced by filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the absence of a frequency offset. However, receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> exhibits several deficiencies in the presence of the frequency offset. Although the carrier loop can correct the frequency offset, the DFE coefficients must be recalculated every time the carrier loop modulates the incoming spectrum with frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Significant time is required whether the DFE is adaptive, or the DFE coefficients are predetermined, for example, calculated off-line. Moreover, the DFE coefficients cannot be recalculated until the carrier loop has acquired frequency lock to within an acceptable degree of accuracy. In some cases, an interaction between the DFE and the carrier loop can lead to receiver instability. This is unacceptable for systems requiring speedy acquisition, such as when receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is to acquire data bursts associated with signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an example receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with improvements over receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a restorative signal generator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for generating, from decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a restorative signal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> responsive to frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;, and more specifically, responsive to frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Restorative signal generator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> coupled to a remodulator <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Thus, restorative signal generator is referred to as a decisional feedback equalizer with remodulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Remodulator <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes a conjugate transformer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> coupled to a multiplier <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Transformer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> transforms frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (for example, e<highlight><superscript>&minus;j&ohgr;n</superscript></highlight>) to a transformed frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that is a complex conjugate of frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (for example, e<highlight><superscript>&plus;j&ohgr;n</superscript></highlight>). Multiplier <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> frequency-shifts decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> away from baseband responsive to frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;, and more specifically, responsive to transformed frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, thereby producing a frequency-shifted decision signal <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The process of multiplying decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> by frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is referred to as remodulation. Remodulation modulates, that is, adjusts the frequency and phase of decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in correspondence with the frequency and phase of frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> filters frequency-shifted decision signal <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to produce restorative signal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In an arrangement of receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> use the same filter coefficients, which may be either adaptive or static. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Restorative signal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is frequency-shifted away from baseband in correspondence with (that is, by an amount equal to) frequency-shifted decision signal <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In other words, restorative signal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is frequency-shifted away from baseband by an amount equal to frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the order of multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is reversed with respect to the order in receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. That is, combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> precedes multiplier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a decisional feedback loop with remodulation, including components <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, compensates for the ISI introduced by filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The carrier loop, including components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, is internal to the decisional feedback loop with remodulation. This arrangement separates the decisional feedback equalizing, and DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, from the frequency-shifting action of the carrier loop. This arrangement also requires the remodulation to maintain compatibility between DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Essentially, the remodulation temporarily undoes the effects of the carrier loop, while DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> operates. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>) receives a data burst in signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the carrier loop in receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> acquires the frequency offset associated with signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. While the carrier loop acquires the frequency offset, frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; evolves over time, for example, on a sample-by-sample basis when the signals of receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> include samples. An inspection of the architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> reveals that as the carrier loop acquires the frequency offset and as frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; evolves toward a settled value, the remodulation process used in restorative signal generator <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (which includes modulating decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> with correction signal <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>) can introduce some remodulation error in the taps of DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (the taps correspond to the vertical branches depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> leading off of the individual outputs of unit delays <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). The remodulation error occurs because while frequency offset &ohgr; evolves toward the settled and correct value, at any instant, there is a sequence of old erroneous frequency estimates propagating in the DFE taps. Even after the frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; settles to a correct value, it will take as many sample clocks (that shift samples through DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) as there are DFE taps to &ldquo;flush out&rdquo; the old values in the DFE, after which time the DFE will contain correct information. </paragraph>

Receiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> for generating, from decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, frequency correction signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; (also indicated at <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>). Carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is the same as carrier loop portion <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, except loop portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> provides frequency-offset estimate <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> as an output signal. Receiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a restorative signal generator <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> for generating, from decision signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a restorative signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> responsive to frequency-offset estimate <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>.

Remodulator <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> includes multipliers <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Remodulator <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> derives phase adjustments <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> from frequency-offset estimate <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and applies the phase adjustments to respective ones of multipliers <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Remodulator <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> phase-adjusts (that is, remodulates) each of time-delayed portions <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> with a respective one of phase adjustments <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, thereby producing phase-adjusted (or remodulated), time-delayed portions <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This process is referred to as remodulation. Weighting stage <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> weights the phase-adjusted, time-delayed portions <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> with respective coefficients C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, to produce weighted, phase-adjusted, time-delayed portions <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>.

Essentially, these multipliers are distributed or recombined internal to the DFE in generator <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, to provide a more efficient implementation. Generator <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> allows changes in the value of frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; caused by the carrier loop to be relatively instantly distributed to all of the taps in generator <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> without delay. This is because remodulator <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> concurrently applies phase adjustments <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> (which are each based on frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;) to multipliers <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> as the frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; becomes available. Thus, as soon as a settled value of frequency-offset estimate &ohgr; becomes available, remodulator <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> applies this settled value to all of the taps. In doing so, the error propagation mentioned above in connection with generator <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Stated otherwise, multipliers <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of generator <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> can be merged within DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to arrive at the architecture depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The resulting phase adjustments <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> (also referred to as remodulation factors) become &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; versions of frequency-offset estimate &ohgr;. Each tap in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is updated as soon as the carrier loop changes, thus reducing error propagation and improving acquisition speed.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A next step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> includes phase-adjusting each of the time-delayed portions with a respective phase adjustment that is based on the frequency-offset estimate, thereby producing phase-adjusted, time-delayed portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A next step <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> includes weighting the phase-adjusted, time-delayed portions with respective coefficients, to produce weighted, phase-adjusted, time-delayed portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A next step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> includes combining the weighted, phase-adjusted, time-delayed portions to produce the restorative signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Exemplary arrangements of receivers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may operate on complex signals, which may be continuous-time or sampled signals. That is, some or all of the signals discussed above, such as signals <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and so on, may be complex signals. In such arrangements, the components of the receivers perform complex operations. For example, multipliers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> perform complex multiplication operations. Other arrangements are possible, for example, wherein the receivers operate on non-complex continuous-time or discrete-time signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A general DFE architecture using a technique called remodulation has been presented. This architecture offers improved stability over known techniques through the decoupling of the carrier loop from the pre-filter (filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) and the decisional feedback equalizer (for example, DFE <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or DFER <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>). Carrier loop adaptation to frequency offsets has little or no affect on the coefficients of the DFE (or DFER), thus allowing speedier acquisition times since the carrier loop characteristically adapts faster than the DFE (or DFER). Also, an efficient implementation of the remodulation allows carrier loop changes to be distributed immediately to the DFER taps. This greatly speeds acquisition times and greatly reduces error propagation. </paragraph>
