<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an electronic interface device which takes input from two electronic devices and permits the user to select which input is fed to a display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many kinds of electronic device for use by individuals are known, such as notebook or laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile telephones. Notebook computers are designed as general purpose computing platforms, and as such include relatively large display screens and powerful multimedia computing capabilities. The multimedia computing requires a dedicated graphics processor that consumes high levels of power. Smaller application specific electronic devices such as PDAs and mobile telephones do not usually require multimedia capabilities and therefore have much smaller display screens. Low power simplified graphics processors are therefore suitable for such devices, with the advantage that the devices consume much lower levels of power, providing for much longer battery life and the use of smaller battery packs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The small display screens on the smaller electronic devices, whilst adequate for many PIM applications, are however not ideal for all uses of such devices, for example for web browsing and note taking applications. Hence the ability to use the larger screen of the notebook computer to display the output of the smaller electronic device would in some circumstances be advantageous, and it is an object of the present invention to provide this new facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention there is provided an electronic interface device characterised in that it has a first input for the receipt of signals from a graphics controller of a first electronic device having a display screen, and a second input for the receipt of signals from a second electronic device, a multiplexer, an output to the display screen of the first electronic device and switch means to select which input signal is fed to the display screen via the output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention provides the advantage that the display screen of the first electronic device can be employed, to display the output from the second electronic device, without any assistance from the microprocessor or graphics controller of the first electronic device, hence saving power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the electronic interface further includes a receiver, connected between the first input and the multiplexer, for conversion of input signals received from the graphics controller of the first electronic device in a first format into a second format, and a transmitter, connected between the multiplexer and the output, for conversion of the selected output signal to the first format, wherein the second input signal is received in the second format and the multiplexer operates on signals in the second format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment the electronic interface device further includes a transmitter, connected between the second input and the multiplexer, for conversion into a first format of the input signal received from the second electronic device in a second format, wherein the first input signal is received in the first format and the multiplexer operates on signals in the first format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Conveniently the first signal format is LVDS and the second signal format is FPL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The electronic interface device may conveniently be implemented on a mixed signal FPGA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The switch means within the electronic interface device is preferably implemented in software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The electronic interface device may conveniently be implemented integrally with the first electronic device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Electronic interface devices according to the invention are to interface between: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (a) a high power graphics controller (GC) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a first electronic device A, such as a notebook computer, having a relatively large display screen (DS) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a microprocessor (&mgr;) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (b) a second electronic device B, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile telephone, which has a lower power graphics controller (GC) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a much smaller display screen (DS) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> than that of the first electronic device A, and a microprocessor (&mgr;) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (c) the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring first in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a first embodiment of an electronic interface device according to the invention is illustrated schematically. The circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a first input <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for receipt of input signals from the high power graphics controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A in a first signal format typically Low Voltage Differential Signalling (LVDS), and a second input <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for receipt of input signals from the graphics controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the second electronic device B in a second signal format typically Flat Panel Link (FPL). The first input signal is fed to a receiver <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which converts it to the second signal format, in this case FPL. The first and second input signals, now both in the second signal format FPL, are fed to a multiplexer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> the output from which is controlled by switch means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, most conveniently implemented by control logic which acts upon commands from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device or the microprocessor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the second electronic device, such that either the first input signal forms the output or the second input signal forms the output. The output from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fed to a transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which converts the selected output to the first signal format, LVDS, which is then fed via an output <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a second embodiment of an electronic interface device according to the invention is illustrated schematically, with parts common to the circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> previously described being like referenced. As before the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has first and second inputs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for receipt of input signals from the graphics controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A and from the graphics controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the second electronic device B respectively. The second input signal is fed to a receiver <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which converts it to the first signal format, in this case LVDS. The first and second input signals, now both in the first signal format LVDS, are fed to a multiplexer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The selected output from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fed via an output <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The invention, in either embodiment, provides the advantage that the large display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A, such as a notebook computer, may be utilised to display the output from the second electronic device B but without the use of the graphics controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A with it&apos;s high power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an example of an integrated circuit implementation of the invention is illustrated schematically, with parts common to the previous Figures being like referenced. The invention may be implemented within the first electronic device A, with the high power graphics controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, receiver <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, multiplexer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, control logic <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being implemented on an integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Implementation of the invention is not limited to the examples of first and second electronic devices described, but may be used for any combination where the first such device has a larger display screen than the second and thus the advantage is provided. Furthermore it is not limited to the particular signal formats of LVDS and FPL described above. These are simply formats which are at present common for the kinds of electronic devices described, but these will inevitably be superseded by other formats in due course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is also envisaged that the second electronic device could also be provided within the outer casing of the first electronic device without a separate display screen of it&apos;s own. This would enable either device to be operated separately, such that simple functions could be undertaken on the low power consuming PDA while the notebook computer could be powered up for more complex functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the present specification &ldquo;comprise&rdquo; means &ldquo;includes or consists of&rdquo; and &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; means &ldquo;including or consisting of&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The features disclosed in the foregoing description, or the following claims, or the accompanying drawings, expressed in their specific forms or in terms of a means for performing the disclosed function, or a method or process for attaining the disclosed result, as appropriate, may, separately, or in any combination of such features, be utilised for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof. </paragraph>
