<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first electronic device A, such a notebook computer has a slot <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for receipt of a mechanical module such as a floppy disc drive, a CD drive or a DVD drive. At the rear of the slot is a mechanical module connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into which in use the selected mechanical module is connected for the transfer of data between the mechanical module and the circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> within the first electronic device A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An electronic interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> according to the invention is for communication between the first electronic device A and a second electronic device B. It includes a receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for receipt of input signals from or the sending of output signals to the second electronic device B, a circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for decoding/coding and mapping of the input signals from and output signals sent to the second electronic device B and a mechanical connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for connection with the mechanical module connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A. It also includes a mechanical connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for a tether lead <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for connection to the second electronic device B. In this embodiment the input and output signals of receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are microprocessor bus compatible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Most conveniently the interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is implemented in a housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is substantially identical to those in which the mechanical modules described above are housed and which is of a size just small enough for receipt in the slot <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the first electronic device A, such that the connectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are readily aligned when the interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is inserted into the slot <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thus connection is simple to achieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are conveniently implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), although other forms of implementation may be used as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of an electronic interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; according to the invention is illustrated, with parts common to the first embodiment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being like referenced. The electronic interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a conversion circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an infrared transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The conversion circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> converts signals received from the second electronic device B in infrared into microprocessor bus compatible format, and converts signals for transmission to the second electronic device B from microprocessor bus compatible format to infrared. Thus communication in this embodiment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is achieved by infrared without the need for a tether lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments may communicate by different means, and will simply require appropriate conversion circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The electronic interface devices <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; operate very simply as follows. When it is desired to transfer data between the first and second electronic devices A, B the interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to the mechanical module connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the first electronic device A. The second electronic device B is aligned with the interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as connected via the tether lead <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or aligned with the infrared transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as required for infra-red wireless connection as appropriate. The data transmission can then take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The data which would normally be communicated to or from a selected mechanical module via the mechanical module connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> uses a large set of addresses. An IDE controller as is normally used for communication between the first electronic device A and a selected mechanical module. Such IDE controllers are typically provided integrated with the relevant drive (floppy, CD or DVD) and are therefore part of the relevant mechanical module. In simple high speed data transfer between devices such as a PDA and a notebook two sets of data addresses are used. Conveniently, 0376H is used to receive data from the second device B and 0170H is used to send data to the second device B. It should be noted that 0376H and 0170 H refer to an &times;86 microprocessor I/O map. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The use of the interface according to the invention does not require an IDE controller to communicate via the module connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus keeping the cost of the device down. Indeed the interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is implemented with minimal low cost components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the present specification &ldquo;comprise&rdquo; means &ldquo;includes or consists of&rdquo; and &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; means &ldquo;including or consisting of&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The features disclosed in the foregoing description, or the following claims, or the accompanying drawings, expressed in their specific forms or in terms of a means for performing the disclosed function, or a method or process for attaining the disclosed result, as appropriate, may, separately, or in any combination of such features, be utilised for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof. </paragraph>
