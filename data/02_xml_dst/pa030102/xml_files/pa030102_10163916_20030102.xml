<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an antenna switch and a method of providing a radio frequency signal to an antenna switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In transceivers, such as mobile telephones, it is known to provide an antenna switch for switching between the transmit and receive path to the antenna. Indeed, multi-band and/or multi-mode devices are known having two or more transmit paths and/or two or more receive paths. Antenna switches may be provided to switch between these parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each transmit path requires a power amplifier to amplify a radio frequency signal to a high enough level for it to reach a receiver, such as a base-station. For multi-mode and multi-band devices, separate power amplifiers may be needed for each mode or band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings illustrates schematically an example of an arrangement of power amplifiers and a switch for a dual band transceiver. The switch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes transmit connections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for inputting respectively GSM 900 and GSM 1800 radio frequency signals. It also includes received connections <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for outputting GSM 900 and GSM 1800 radio frequency signals, together with an antenna connection <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for connection to an antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The illustrated power amplifier for the transmit (TX) paths has three stages, though two or four stages could be used depending on the application. As illustrated, the first stage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be provided in common for both transmit paths. However, it is usually necessary, as illustrated, to provide separate third stage amplifiers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for the respective transmit paths. It will be appreciated also that each subsequent stage of amplification requires greater die area than the previous stage. The areas required for the final stage of amplification are significantly great and, hence, add to the size and cost of producing the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for multi-band and/or multi-mode devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide amplification and switching of a radio frequency signal which at least reduces the problems discussed above and in which the area required for amplification can be reduced, particularly with regard to multi-band and/or multi-mode devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a method of providing a radio frequency signal to an antenna. The method includes selectively connecting the radio frequency signal to the antenna with an antenna switch including at least one transistor and amplifying the radio frequency signal by arranging the at least one transistor of the antenna switch to provide amplification of the radio frequency signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This may be achieved by providing the radio frequency signal to the gate of the at least one transistor so as to amplify the radio frequency signal and selectively providing a DC bias to the gate of the at least one transistor so as to turn the transistor on or off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is also provided an antenna switch including a transmit connection for inputting a radio frequency signal, an antenna connection for connection to an antenna for transmitting the radio frequency signal and a signal path between the transmit connection and the antenna connection including at least one transmit transistor controllable to connect selectively the transmit connection to the antenna connection so as to transfer the radio frequency signal from the transmit connection to the antenna connection. The transmit transistor is arranged so as to provide a stage of amplification to the radio frequency signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this way, any transistors already required by the antenna switch to selectively connect transmit paths to the antenna can be used to provide the final stage of amplification. This results in a die area which is considerably less than the sum of the previously used separate power amplifier and switch, thereby also providing a significant cost reduction. Furthermore, this architecture allows the overall efficiency of the transmit chain to increase. Thus, for a mobile telephone handset, an improved talk-time can be given from a given battery capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that, by reducing the overall area in this way, it becomes possible to provide multi-band and multi-mode operations more easily at reduced cost. In this respect, it will be appreciated that the power amplification for each transmit path can be provided in the same way as defined above, i.e. by the transistor(s) of the respective paths in the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> This arrangement results in a separate third or final output stage of the power amplifier being eliminated. Since, in the previous architecture, the antenna switch adds insertion loss to the transmit path, the new architecture reduces losses and thus improves efficiency. This is because the transmit switch function also performs the function of the power amplifier output stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another benefit is that the power amplifier output impedance level is higher, thus allowing far greater ease of multi-band and multi-mode operation due to the lower Q-factor and larger frequency bandwidths over which they can be matched, for instance to 50 ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the signal path includes a plurality of series connected transmit transistors, the transmit transistors together providing the stage of amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is normal to provide, for each signal path, a plurality of series connected transistors, i.e. connected drain to source, to connect or disconnect that path from the antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It need not be necessary to use any additional transistors for each signal path, such that no additional area is required by the transistors. However, each series connected plurality of transistors may be connected to the rest of the circuit in a novel manner so as to achieve the required amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The antenna switch may of course include a plurality of signal paths with one or more transistor in each path for selectively connecting the respective path to the antenna connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the transmit connection is connected to the gate of the or each transmit transistor such that the radio frequency signal is transferred from the transmit connection to the gate of the or each transmit transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this way, each transistor (where there is more than one) in the signal path from a transmit connection amplifies the radio frequency signal supplied to that transmit connection. A suitable bias is provided at the drain, gate and source of the or each transistor such that it provides the required amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a gate DC bias circuit is connected to the gate of the or each transmit transistor so as to enable the respective transmit transistor to be turned on or off according to a DC gate bias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Thus, for each signal path, the transistor(s) can be turned on or off so as to provide the antenna switch functionality as well as the amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the drain/source conduction path of the transmit transistor or transistors is connected between a DC bias connection and ground such that the transmit transistor or transistors can be turned on or off according to a DC drain/source bias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Thus, by means of the DC bias connection, a DC bias may be selectively applied such that the drain/source conduction path of each transistor has an appropriate bias voltage to cause the required amplification. By removing the DC bias, the transistors may be turned off and amplification prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In general, whether or not a transistor is turned on or off will depend on the drain/source voltage. Thus, the transistors may be turned on or off by varying appropriately the DC bias applied across respective sources and drains. In particular, this is preferably achieved by varying the relative values of the gate bias voltages applied by the gate bias circuit and the drain/source bias voltage applied by the bias connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the signal path includes an inductor/capacitor resonant circuit connected between the transistor or transistors and the antenna connection so as to eliminate one or more frequencies. An L/C parallel trap may be provided so as to eliminate a particular frequency or a series resonant pass may be provided so as to pass only the frequency of the respective signal path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This is particularly useful when another signal path in the antenna switch is used for a higher frequency radio frequency signal, for instance a harmonic in the case of GSM 900 and GSM 1800. In particular, it would not be possible to eliminate these higher frequencies using a low pass filter at the antenna due to the need for transmitting similar frequencies from the other signal path. Thus, a parallel resonant 1800 MHz trap may be used to eliminate the 1800 MHz harmonic of the GSM900 signal path, or a series resonant 900 MHz pass may be used to pass only the 900 MHz signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a matching circuit is provided between the signal path and the antenna connection to provide impedance matching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that standard amplification stages include impedance matching, for instance to 50 ohms in the case of mobile telephone technology, to match them to down stream components. Since it is proposed to use the antenna switch transistors for amplification as well as switching, a suitable matching circuit is proposed for the output of the transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As suggested above, the antenna switch may include at least one additional signal path, for instance starting with a transmit connection. In this case, the matching circuit preferably provides impedance matching at at least two frequencies corresponding to the frequencies intended for the respective transmit connections and signal paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Hence, when the antenna switch includes multiple transmit paths for different respective bands, the antenna switch should be matched to the antenna for all of those bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the signal path includes at least one amplification stage between the transmit connection and the at least one transmit transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Since the final and largest stage of amplification has been incorporated into the antenna switch, preferably for each transmit path, it becomes possible to integrate the earlier and smaller stages of amplification in the same arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The antenna switch may be embodied as an MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thus, all of the amplification and switching circuits may be implemented in one single integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is preferably provided a transceiver and a mobile telephone unit including an antenna switch as defined above.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description, given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention is particularly applicable to power amplifier and antenna switch architectures for multi-band and/or multi-mode transceivers such as mobile telephone handsets. Within the GSM mode, four bands exist, namely GSM 900 (also known merely as GSM), GSM 1800 (also known as DCS), GSM 1900 (also known as PCS) and GSM 850. Furthermore, there are additional modes such as EDGE and the third generation WCDMA standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a handset capable of transmitting or receiving in different bands or modes, it is necessary to provide an antenna switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a known triple band antenna switch arrangement. A plurality of transmit connections TX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, TX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and receive connections RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, RX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to an antenna connection <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via respective signal paths. Although illustrated for simplicity with a single transistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in each path, four series transistors, such as JFETs, may actually be provided in series for each path, with the source of one transistor connected to the drain of the adjacent transistor. A resistor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> bridges the drain and source of each transistor and a bias voltage is provided to the drains and sources of the transistors from a supply voltage Vdd via a diode <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a radio frequency isolation capacitor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and respective resistors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. By virtue of the diode <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the drains and sources of the transistors are biassed to a voltage below the supply voltage Vdd, for instance at Vdd minus 1.2V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> By selectively applying the supply voltage Vdd to the respective gates of the transistors, they may be turned on so as to allow transfer of a radio frequency signal between the antenna connection <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a respective transmit or receive connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, power amplifiers are required to amplify radio frequency signals from the transmit path to a high enough level in order to reach a base-station. For instance, for GSM 900, maximum output levels of 33 dBm (2 watts) is required and, for GSM 1800, maximum output levels of 30 dBm (1 watt) is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Typically, separate power amplifiers are required for each mode or band though, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, initial stages of power amplification may be shared in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The present invention proposes a new architecture which combines the separate power amplifiers and switch components into one circuit, preferably a MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) based on GaAs (Gallium Arsenide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the radio frequency paths for a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The particular illustrated embodiment is a dual band device. However, it should be appreciated that additional signal paths can be introduced for additional bands or modes. Similarly, the present invention could also be used in a single band and single mode device and/or a transmitter with no receive paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, transmit connections <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are provided. These each provide respective radio frequency signals to signal paths which lead to an antenna connection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Each signal path first includes two stages of amplification <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. These stages of amplification may be of any suitable design and include matched outputs of preferably 50 ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As with previous antenna switches, each signal path then includes a plurality of transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, such as JFETs, connected in series, i.e. with the source of one connected to the drain of the next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> However, unlike the previous antenna switch, the radio frequency signal of each respective signal path is provided to the gates of the respective transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The drain of the first transistor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of each series is, in contrast, connected to ground <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. By applying a suitable bias voltage to the drains and sources of the transistors, as well as to the gates, it is possible to provide them in a state suitable for amplifying the radio frequency signal provided to their gates. In this way, the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are used for the output stage of the power amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> This arrangement results in a separate third or final output stage of the power amplifier being eliminated. Since, in the previous architecture, the antenna switch adds insertion loss to the transmit path, the new architecture reduces losses and thus improves efficiency. This is because the transmit switch function also performs the function of the power amplifier output stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Another benefit is that the power amplifier output impedance level is higher, thus allowing far greater ease of multi-band and multi-mode operation due to the lower Q-factor and larger frequency bandwidths over which they can be matched, for instance to 50 ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, transmit connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is intended for GSM 900 at 900 MHz and transmit connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is intended for GSM 1800 at 1800 MHz. However, it will be appreciated that the signal paths from the transmit connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and transmit connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> respectively could additionally be used for GSM 850 and GSM 1900. Thus, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> could be adapted to be tri band or four band by adding appropriate receive signal paths. Of course, other embodiments, might include additional paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Amplification of the 900 MHz signal with transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will result in the generation of harmonics. Since the first of these will be at 1800 MHz, i.e. the frequency of the signal provided to transmit connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the illustrated embodiment includes a filter <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for removing these components. In particular, this may be a parallel inductor/capacitor 1800 MHz trap, though a 900 MHz pass could alternatively be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Since the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are now operating as amplifiers, their outputs will be relatively low impedance and will need matching to the antenna. Hence, an impedance matching circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided for connecting the respective signal paths to the antenna connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Since a signal matching circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided in common for the signal paths, including the receive signal paths, it is provided to match the impedance for each of the respective bands. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, a double resonant output matching circuit is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Finally, it may be noted that the receive signal paths are of a known construction since it is not necessary to provide any radio frequency amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a dual band arrangement similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but in which the separate power amplifiers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have been incorporated into a switch <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. However, the smaller shared power amplifiers <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on this embodiment are provided separately to the switch <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the DC bias connections of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A gate DC bias circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the gates of transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and a DC bias connection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided to apply a DC drain/source bias to the source to drain conduction path of the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In particular, when the transmission path from transmit connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is turned on, a voltage of 12 volts is applied at the DC bias connection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, thereby providing 12 volts over the conduction path through the source/drains of the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to ground <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As will become apparent from the description given below, since the transistors are also acting as amplifiers, they will draw some current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A capacitor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is provided to isolate the DC bias connection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from other signal paths in the circuit. An inductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> acts as a high impedance to the RF signal but low impedance for the DC bias so as to prevent the RF signal affecting the power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, with the DC drain/source bias applied across all of the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in series, the respective voltage across each of the transistors will be different. Hence, in order to bias the respective gates to bring the transistors into an amplifying state, it is necessary to provide different respective gate voltages. Hence, the gate DC bias circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a gate voltage of 0 volts to transistor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, 3 volts to transistor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, 6 volts to transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and 9 volts to transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Each gate is connected to the gate DC bias circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by means of a respective resistor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. These resistors act as a high impedance to the RF signal but as a sufficiently low impedance to the DC gate bias. This is because the gate has a very high impedance for DC, but low impedance for RF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Also, each gate is connected to the signal path, i.e. the output of amplifying stage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, by means of a respective capacitor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for isolating the bias applied to each gate from the other gates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Optionally, capacitor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may also be provided as a block to the DC voltages to the upstream power amplifier stages. This supplements the DC isolation provided by capacitors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Finally, it is also possible to use additional small transistors <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, such as FETs, on each gate in order to improve the isolation between the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. These small transistors are biassed to be on or off at the same time as the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In order to turn off the signal path from the connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the DC bias connection is brought to 0 volts and the gate DC bias circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> brings the gate voltage of all of the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to &minus;3.8 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In this way, the transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the signal path from the connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may selectively be controlled between on and off states wherein, in the on state, they also act as an amplifying stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the signal path from connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided with a gate DC bias circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, DC bias connection <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, capacitor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, inductor <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, resistors <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, capacitors <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, capacitor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and, optionally, small transistors <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. As will be appreciated, these components operate in a manner directly equivalent to those discussed above, such that the signal path from connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may also be turned on or off selectively. It will be appreciated that, in order to operate this circuit, a supply voltage of 12 volts is required due to the fact that the final amplifier stage includes 4 transistors in series. This means that the operating voltage is 4 times that of a conventional 3 volt FET output stage. However, an appropriate DC-DC converter can easily be integrated as part of the power amplifier power control function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Of course, it will be appreciated that the required DC bias voltages will differ accordingly if transistors of different characteristics are used or if less than or more than 4 transistors are provided in series. Similarly, with different materials for the devices, the applied polarities may be reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The antenna switch arrangement may be used in a transceiver such as a mobile telephone as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
