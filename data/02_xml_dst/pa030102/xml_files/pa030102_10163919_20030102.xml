<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to Integrated Circuit (IC) testing. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a Vddq IC testing system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various test strategies and systems have been designed to efficiently test electronic integrated circuits to detect manufacturing defects. One of the test method that is widely used is the so called &ldquo;Iddq&rdquo; testing method that is based on the measure of the quiescent power supply current, hence the terminology Iddq, of a CMOS IC. To determine whether the IC passes or fails the test, a measured current value is usually compared to a threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally, a main drawback of Iddq testing is its relatively low frequency of operation, yielding a relatively slow testing procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with emerging submicron technologies and their increased leakage current levels, determining the threshold that separates faulty ICs from good ICs becomes increasingly difficult, which is another major drawback of the conventional Iddq testing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it is therefore apparent that there is still room in the art for improvements in IC testing systems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A Vddq integrated testing method relying on a system according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with references to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a nutshell, a general concept of the present invention is to place a resistive element (P-FET1) between a voltage output terminal (Vaa) of a voltage supply source and a power supply terminal (VDD) of an IC under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Since the current drain of the IC under test is expected to be very small when the IC is in a steady state, the voltage at the power supply terminal VDD is expected to be close to Vaa because only a small voltage drop in the resistive element P-FET1 is expected. As it is the case in Iddq testing, it is possible to determine if the IC under test is faulty, i.e. if it contains manufacturing defects, by comparing the resulting VDD value to a predetermined threshold or by other post-processing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> summarizes this general concept. In step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the IC under test and a voltage source are provided. Step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is the positioning of the resistive element P-FET1 between the output terminal Vaa of the voltage source and the power supply terminal VDD of the IC under test. A test vector is then prepared for the IC under test (step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The test vector is then applied and the voltage present at the terminal VDD is then approximated. The approximated value of the voltage present at the terminal VDD is compared with a previous known value of VDD or stored for further post-processing (step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> From the result of this comparison or post-processing, step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> determines if the IC under test is to be considered faulty. In step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, should the IC under test be considered faulty, the test ends (step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). Otherwise, the system then verifies that all the required test vectors have been applied to the IC under test (step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). If it is so, the test ends (step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). If not, the system returns to step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a further test vector is prepared and applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Of course, as will easily be understood by one skilled in the art, more than one test vector is usually used to determine whether the IC under test is faulty. Therefore, steps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are repeated as many times as different test vectors are applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention may also include methods for increasing the speed of the test. Indeed, as will be more easily understood by one skilled in the art upon reading the following description in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, which is a possible implementation of the comparing step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, two strategies are proposed to decrease the time required to perform the Vddq test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Generally stated, a first strategy is to provide a controllable switch (P-FET2) between the terminal of the voltage output Vaa and the terminal of the IC under test VDD. This switch, when in a conductive state, allows more current to flow from the voltage source to the IC under test, thereby decreasing the delay for the IC under test to reach again its steady state when a new test vector is applied thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A second strategy involves actively determining the value of the voltage at the power supply terminal VDD by successively comparing the value of this voltage to predetermined values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Turning now more specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, the implementation of these two strategies will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> consists in providing a supplementary controllable output voltage source having a voltage output terminal (VVS) connected to the power supply terminal VDD of the IC under test. This can be advantageously achieved via a controllable switch element (SWA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A differentiator circuit (DX) having an input connected to the power supply terminal VDD of the IC under test is also provided (step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). The purpose of the differentiator circuit will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a supplementary controllable switch (PFET2) is provided between the output terminal Vaa of the voltage source and the power supply terminal VDD of the IC under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A controller is further provided (step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) to control the controllable output voltage source VVS, the controllable switch element SWA, the differentiator circuit DX and the supplementary controllable switch P-FET2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the output voltage VVS is set to a predetermined initial value that is the central value of a predetermined voltage range that is advantageously large enough to contain foreseen possible values that the voltage at the terminal VDD may take. It is believed that one skilled in the art would have no problem in selecting the predetermined initial value for a specific IC to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In step, the switch P-FET2 is placed in a conductive state to allow the high switching currents to flow easily before a test vector is supplied thereto. Then the test vector is applied (step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). Once all the switching is completed and all the logical values are stable, i.e. when the IC under test has reached a steady state under the test vector, the switch P-FET2 is returned to a non-conductive state (step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). Steps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> therefore embody the first above-noted strategy of decreasing the time required for the IC under test to reach its steady state. It is to be noted that the time required for the IC under test to reach a steady state is different from a type of IC to another. It is therefore believed within the skills of one versed in the art to determine the duration of the conduction period of the switch P-FET2, which is to correspond to the time required for the specific IC under test to reach a steady state after the test vector is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The output terminal VVS is then connected to the power supply terminal VDD via the switch SWA (step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). The node VDD2 is thereby brought to a voltage value dictated by the output terminal WS. After an adequate delay that ensures that the node VDD2 is indeed at the voltage value dictated by VVS, the switch SWA is placed back in a non-conductive state (step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>) to disconnect the node VDD2 from the output terminal VVS. Again, it is to be noted that the time required for the node VDD2 to reach the WS voltage is different from a type of IC to another. It is therefore believed within the skills of one versed in the art to determine the duration of the conduction period of the switch SWA, which essentially depends on the equivalent impedance as seen from the VVS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Upon disconnection of the node VDD2 from the output terminal WS, the voltage of the node VDD2 tends to converge towards a final value, i.e., the value that is to be approximated. In step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the differentiator determines the direction of the voltage variation to determine whether VVS is greater than VDD2. In step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the actual comparison between the voltages present respectively at terminals WS and VDD2 takes place. If WS is greater than VDD2 (step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>), the value of VVS is decreased by a calculated increment. On the other hand, if VDD2 is greater than VVS (step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>), the value of WS is increased by a calculated increment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The system then verifies whether the number of iteration is equal to a predetermined number of iteration (step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>), which is determined according to a desired precision of the final estimated value of the voltage present at terminal VDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If the predetermined number of iteration has been completed, the system assumes that the estimated voltage value of VDD equals VVS plus or minus half the calculated increment (step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). If not, the system returns to step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to begin a new iteration with the adjusted value of WS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Examples of Determination of the Range of Voltage </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> There are several ways to determine a voltage range and the calculated increment, as will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A first method consists in using a digital controllable voltage source that is controllable using 8 bits, i.e. 255 increments, and by setting the higher value, i.e. value 255, at the value of Vaa (for example, 3.3 volts). In this case, the initial voltage value would be value 128, i.e. the middle of the voltage range. After the first iteration, the value of VVS is adjusted to either 192 or 64 depending on the outcome of the comparison in step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in a second iteration, the remaining range is further divided by two. As will easily be understood by one skilled in the art, after six iterations a precision of about 0.052 volts (4/255&times;3.3) is achieved for the value of VDD2. In other words, the value of VVS is adjusted midway between a current value of VVS and the corresponding end of the current voltage range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A minor drawback of the above-mentioned method is that it considers that VDD2 may take any value between 0 and 3.3 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A second method involves setting an initial threshold below which the IC under test is automatically considered faulty and starting the evaluation from this threshold. For example, if the IC under test has a nominal voltage of 3.3 volts, the initial threshold could be set to 2.0 volts. If the first iteration determines that VDD2 is below this value, the IC is automatically rejected as faulty. If VDD2 is above 2.0 volts, the voltage range is set between 2.0 volts (value 0) and 3.3 volts (value <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>) and the test can continue as described hereinabove. As will be apparent to one skilled in the art, this second method has two advantages: it allows some faulty ICs to be rejected at the very beginning of the test through the use of a threshold and it needs less iterations to reach the same precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, a Vddq IC testing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The testing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a voltage source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having a known voltage output terminal Vaa <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a resistive element P-FET1 <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provided between the voltage output terminal Vaa <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a node VDD2 <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to which an IC under test <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is to be connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes a controllable output voltage source <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having an output VVS <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that may be connected to the node VDD2 <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via a controllable switch element SWA <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>; a differentiator circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> connected to the node VDD2 <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via an input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and a supplementary controllable switch P-FET2 <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> connected between the output terminal Vaa <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the node VDD2 <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Finally, the testing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> connected to the voltage source <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, to the switch <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and to the switch <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to enable an adequate operation of these elements. The controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is also connected to the IC under test <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to sequentially supply test vectors thereto. It is believed that one skilled in the art would be in a position to determine the number and nature of the test vectors to be applied before the testing of a particular IC is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that should the resistive element P-FET1 <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> take the form of a Field Effect Transistor, it could be controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is also to be noted that the differentiator <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> has an output <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> connected to the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to supply it with information about the direction of the voltage variation as discussed hereinabove, thereby allowing the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to determine if the value of the voltage of terminal VVS <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is to be increased or decreased. For example, the differentiator <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> may supply two different signals to the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, namely a first signal indicating that the voltage VVS <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> decreases and a second signal to indicate that the voltage VVS <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The use of two different signals to indicate different directions of the voltage variation is advantageous for many reasons. First, it makes possible to select different thresholds for voltage increases and decreases. Second, it may accelerate the entire process in the close neighborhood of the final voltage since neither signal would then be emitted, thus enabling the controller to stop the process, which is not feasible when a single signal having two possible values is used. Third, it may be part of the effort to reduce the noise since the data is more precise than when a single signal is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Of course, the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be programmable and is advantageously provided with instructions to monitor the system described hereinabove with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. It is believed that one skilled in the art would have no problem selecting the controller and programming it accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The operation of the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is believed to be easily understandable by one skilled in the art having read the description of the method hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The frequency of operation of the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is advantageous, for example when the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> implements strategies like the ones described hereinabove such as to increase the testing speed. Indeed, the switch P-FET2 <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is used to decrease the required time for the IC under test <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to reach its steady state and the controllable voltage source <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is used in the successive approximation of the value of the voltage present at the power supply terminal VDD by the increase or the decrease of the value of WS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Turning now briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, a more comprehensive diagram of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from this figure, the resistive element P-FET1 <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a resistor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the supplementary controllable switch P-FET2 <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is a P-type field effect transistor (FET). The source <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> takes the form of a DAC having an output fed to an operational amplifier allowing the shaping of the signal and having an output supplied to a buffer. The controllable switch element SWA <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> takes the form of an analog switch and the differentiator circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes a sample &amp; hold circuit, a comparator and a buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of the appended drawings illustrates a Vddq IC testing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Since the testing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is very similar to the testing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, and for concision purposes, only the differences between these two systems will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The main difference between the systems <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is that the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes three (3) controllable output voltage sources <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> having respective output terminals WS1, WS2 and WS3 having reference numerals <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> connected to the node VDD2 <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via respective controllable switching elements <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this arrangement of three independently controlled output voltage source allows the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, while one of the source <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is adjusted to the predetermined initial value (in step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>), to adjust the other two sources to the increased and decreased values of WS (steps <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively). The system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is thereby ready to connect the adequate voltage source to the node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the next iteration of the process. As will easily be understood by one skilled in the art, this feature further decreases the testing time since it allows some of the steps described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to be done simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, a Vddq IC testing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be briefly described. Since the testing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is very similar to the testing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, and for concision purposes, only the differences between these two systems will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The main difference between the systems <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is that a current source <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a protection circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The main purpose of the current source <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is to supply the main portion of the current required by the IC under test. Indeed, it has been found since the current required by CMOS circuits tend to increase as the size of the devices decreases, it may be interesting to provide a current source <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that is initially set to supply the totality of the current required by the IC under test. If the IC under test is faulty, only the supplemental current required will be supplied by the source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This feature is also interesting since is allows the measure to be more precise since a larger value of the resistive element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be used without accounting for a voltage drop caused by the normal stray current of the IC under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The introduction of the current source <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in the system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> makes it interesting to provide a protection circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> since the initial current supplied by the current source <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> could be too high for subsequent test vectors. Should not protection circuit be used, this too high current could potentially damage the IC under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is also to be note that in the system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> the P-FET1 is controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As will readily be understood by one skilled in the art, while the system described herein by way of different embodiments thereof measures the voltage at the power supply terminal of the IC under test, the system of the present invention can easily be modified to measure the voltage between the ground terminal of the IC under test and the electrical ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described hereinabove by way of preferred embodiments thereof, it can be modified, without departing from the spirit and nature of the subject invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
