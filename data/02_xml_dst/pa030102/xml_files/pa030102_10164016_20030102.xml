<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the field of healthcare, and more specifically, a system for and method of using targeted questions directed to a covered population and responses to those questions to monitor and improve the health of the covered population. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Healthcare costs have been rising at a staggering rate over the past two decades. In response, individuals, businesses, and insurance carriers have been seeking ways to lower healthcare costs. For instance, the rise in the use of health maintenance organizations (HMO&apos;s) is one attempt to gain control of the costs of healthcare. While controlling costs is one way to reduce the costs of healthcare, the only way to reduce the costs of healthcare in the long run is to focus on the &ldquo;demand side.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the best ways to reduce the costs of healthcare is to reduce the demand for healthcare by maintaining and improving the health of members of a covered population of people. Not only does this reduce the costs of health care for the insurer and those paying premiums, but it also increases the quality of life for those whose health is improved. One goal of a demand side program may be to increase the life expectancy and quality of life of population members by helping individuals gain the knowledge, motivation, and opportunities they need to make informed decisions about their health. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A comprehensive health promotion/disease prevention program is thus helpful to reduce demand side costs. Accurate information regarding the covered population is helpful in establishing an effective health promotion/disease prevention program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Preventable illness makes up approximately 70 percent of the burden of illness and its associated costs. Preventable causes of illness, led by cigarette smoking, lack of exercise and poor diet, represent eight of the nine leading causes of death in the U.S., accounting for 980,000 deaths per year. Self efficacy, the confidence gained by accepting accountability for one&apos;s lifestyle choices, is helpful for subsequent changes in health behaviors. Researchers and experts have shown that appropriate health care utilization is linked to the presence or absence of personal self-efficacy and to the availability of well-presented information. However, present questionnaire systems do not acquire the desired information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are existing systems that provide a system of questionnaires directed at individual participants of the covered population. Such programs operate by using a finite set of questionnaires broken up into channeling questionnaires and serial questionnaires. The channeling questionnaires are used to determine whether individual members of the population fall into a high risk or low risk profile. Members who are determined to be in the low risk profile receive the same repeated questionnaire every six months. Members in the high risk profile receive one or more of a finite number of high risk questionnaires every three months. For instance, high risk questionnaires, or modules, are available on weight management, smoking, asthma, arthritis, as well as additional areas. While these programs may be effective in developing questionnaires and feedback, they are not truly targeted because they fails to modify the questionnaire based on the answers to previous questionnaires. In other words, the same individual, having certain characteristics, will receive the same questionnaire repeatedly, regardless of his answers on previous questionnaires. This leads to poor participation and repeated feedback. In addition, the such programs are unable to assess the staging of the individual, or the individuals inclination toward adopting behavioral changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming the one or more problems or disadvantages associated with the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Healthcare programs may be managed in part, by responding to the health characteristics of the population associated with the healthcare program. Health related information associated with the population needs to be gathered in order to determine the health characteristics of the population. This health related information may be gathered through multiple questionnaires disseminated to the population. That is, as discussed below, there is an initial questionnaire disseminated to the population to establish some preliminary health related information associated with the population. Then, based on the responses to the initial questionnaire, one or more targeted questionnaires is established and disseminated to an associated target population. The targeted population may be a portion, or subset of the entire population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart of the targeted questionnaire and feedback process for an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Targeted questionnaire and feedback process (TQF process) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> begins at stage <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the building of Health Risk Assessments (&ldquo;HRAs&rdquo;). In the exemplary embodiment, HRAs are developed to refine and/or define a targeted HRA strategy, define questions, priorities, frequencies, timing, and the targeted population. At stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, medical expertise may be employed to develop the appropriate feedback to HRA results. At stage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the HRAs developed in stage <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the feedback developed in stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be entered into a computer system or manually compiled, so that, at stage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, targeted HRA packages may be generated for individual participants in the population based on the targeted population defined in stage <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Further, at stage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the HRA packages are administered to the targeted population. At stage <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the results of the HRA packages are entered into the computer system which generates individual feedback based on the results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart of the building of the HRAs of stage <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. HRAs are developed to refine and/or define the targeted HRA strategy, define questions, priorities, frequencies, timing, and the targeted population. At stage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the targeted HRA strategy is developed. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, this is performed by medical experts, e.g. doctors, nurses, etc., who define a medical target for improvement among the covered population. However, other clinical personnel or management may take part in the process. Indeed, the targeted HRA strategy could even be performed automatically based on analysis of health data of the covered population. Smoking cessation is one possible targeted HRA strategy that may be defined at stage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This is one of many particular strategies that could be defined by physicians, management, clinical personnel, or suggested by automated computer analysis well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, targeted questions are developed based on the specific targeted strategy defined in stage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The questions developed are up to the expertise of the physicians or clinicians involved, but they generally lie in one of four categories. Targeted questions are those questions administered to a member of the population based at least in part upon results from previously administered questionnaires to that member, such as the initial questionnaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One category of a targeted question is an applicability question. An applicability question establishes whether further questions would be appropriate from the respondent of the questionnaire. For instance, a targeted smoking questionnaire may ask, &ldquo;Do you currently smoke cigarettes&quest;&rdquo; This would alleviate the need for the respondent to answer further questions about their smoking habits. While the questionnaire would generally not go to a non-smoker, the relevant personnel data may be out of date or the person may have recently quit smoking. The second category of questions are in regard to contraindications. These questions relate to whether a particular course of treatment or feedback suggestions are appropriate based on the respondents&apos; medical history. The third category of questions is about barriers. Questions may be posed to determine what barriers to treatment might lie in the respondents&apos; attitudes to treatment. A fourth category of questions relates to staging, or what mental stage a respondent is at in terms of his readiness to proceed with treatment, i.e., is the person willing to change their lifestyle. Other categories and types of questions may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, at stage <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, priorities may be assigned to the strategy developed at stage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. HRA strategies may be prioritized so that when targeted questionnaires are generated at stage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the questions relating to a particular strategy will appear in their order of priority. Also, limits may be imposed on the length of a questionnaire, and those HRA strategies of lower priority may have to be removed from the generated targeted HRA questionnaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, frequencies may be defined for how often the questions associated with this HRA strategy should be repeated. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, HRA strategy questions are assigned a frequency with which they should be asked. This reduces repetition and permits lower priority HRA strategy questions the opportunity to be posed when they might be otherwise blocked by higher HRA strategy questions. In addition, the frequency may be modified based dynamically on future responses or targeted feedback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the timing of questions may be established. Similar to the frequency concept of stage <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the timing concept might be used to block questions from being presented at certain times of the year or to trigger an HRA strategy to be presented. For instance, weight associated HRA strategy questions might be disabled over the Christmas holiday season when weight loss and treatment strategies are less successful. By the same token, post New Years Day might trigger weight associated HRA strategies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the target population for the HRA strategy developed at stage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is defined. A Targeted HRA Person Model may be used to define the target population. The target population is the result of a match of HRA strategies with a database of information about the covered population to determine which members of the covered population receive the HRA strategy questions (the target population). Established target population characteristics are used in a query to the database to determine the appropriate target population. For instance, for an HRA strategy of an aspirin regimen for those members of the covered population having cardiovascular risk, the target population may be defined as males over the age of 50 or females over the age of 55 who have an additional cardiovascular risk. Additional factors that may be used to establish the target population include, but are not limited to, the personnel database, self-reported information from previous questionnaires, or medical and drug records. A single HRA strategy may have multiple targeted populations, as illustrated above for the aspirin strategy. Different HRA strategies may well have different target populations established. A given target population, of which there are an almost infinite number in a set of covered population, may find themselves the target of multiple HRA strategies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An HRA strategy may be targeted at one or more health risks. For instance, a health risk may be cardiovascular risk. The targeted questionnaire may be used to establish who is at risk for cardiovascular problems in the targeted population. A profile may be used to indicate which members of the target population would respond to a particular HRA strategy, e.g. aspirin regime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, the results are analyzed. In addition, once a targeted population is identified, the creator of the Targeted HRA Person Model may run a simulation of the model against the database of the covered population to determine how many people match the model. This is useful, for instance, when budgetary constraints may enable the feedback that will have the largest success rate for the identified health risk, and that will impact the most people, to be established. Or, fixed startup costs of an HRA strategy may require that a minimum number of people participate to justify the costs of generating and implementing the HRA strategy. Running a simulation allows the Person Model to be tuned to increase or decrease the number of covered population who would be included in the target population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Feedback and modification of the targeted HRA process is useful in making continuous improvement to the process. Where prior art &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; questionnaire systems not only fail to truly target a population, they also fail to modify themselves based on the successes or failures of an overall HRA strategy <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. At stage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, the system, either manually or through an automated process, may modify one or more of the characteristics defined in stages <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. TQF process <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may yield a large database of results of HRA targeted questionnaires and may have access to the feedback provided to the target population, as well as the target population&apos;s medical records. Examination of the results of the TQF process may provide information that would suggest, for instance, the enlargement of the targeted population, so that an HRA strategy may possibly benefit additional members of the covered population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, at stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> the tailored feedback is established. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, this is established by defining a set of appropriate responses (feedback) to self-reported answers of one or more questions. These Tailored feedback&mdash;Person Models may define a set of appropriate responses for each person model who answered the targeted questionnaire. The Tailored feedback&mdash;Person Model is based on the answers to the questions of the targeted questionnaire and the characteristics of the person completing the questionnaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For instance, a targeted smoking questionnaire might have one tailored feedback designed for those over age 60 who smoke, have tried multiple times to quit, and are contemplating quitting in the next month, while a second tailored feedback is intended for those over age 60 who smoke and have no interest in quitting smoking. The feedback may be a letter, an implementation strategy, a follow-up questionnaire, etc. The feedback may be illustrated with regard to a preset letter for each Tailored feedback&mdash;Person Model. However, the Tailored feedback&mdash;Person Model, may be defined such that individual paragraphs, or even sentences, are placed into a form letter based on the model. Through the use of a paragraph, instead of a letter-based model, greater flexibility is given to generate a single feedback letter when a targeted questionnaire may be composed of multiple HRA strategy questions. Thus, an individual who is a member of two different targeted populations, for instance colorectal cancer and smoking, and who receives both sets of HRA strategy questions may receive a single feedback letter comprising all feedback, instead of two feedback letters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the targeted HRA questions, Targeted HRA&mdash;Person Models, and Tailored feedback Person Models may be input into the computer system database. The computing platform <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, more fully shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and its accompanying description, may include a database <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> describing the covered population and a database having health records, including medical and pharmaceutical records for the covered population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the targeted HRAs are administered. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating the process of administering targeted HRAs in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. At stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a trigger is generated that initiates the administration process <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The trigger may be manually generated or may be automatically generated based on time or calendar information ore previously acquired information. For instance, the system may activate a trigger every fiscal quarter. Once the trigger is activated, at stage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, the computing platform <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> searches its database of HRA strategies and determines the highest priority strategy that has not been utilized during the current process <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. At stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the frequency is checked to determine if the current date is appropriate for administering the selected HRA strategy or if the current time is too close in frequency to the last time the HRA strategy was administered. If the frequency is too soon, processing proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> where processing of other HRA strategies may proceed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If the frequency is appropriate, flow proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> where the time constraints are checked to see if the current date is a time blocked date for the selected HRA strategy. If the date is blocked for the current strategy, flow continues to stage <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>; otherwise, flow proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the Targeted HRA Person Model of the selected HRA strategy is used to generate a query of the covered population database. This query yields a subset of the covered population, which is the targeted population for this HRA strategy. At stage <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, a member of the targeted population is selected. At stage <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, for the selected member of the targeted population, a check may be performed of the length of the targeted HRA questionnaire that has been generated thus far. If a maximum length has been selected for the questionnaire and the length has been exceeded, flow continues to stage <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> where further members of the target population may be processed. If the maximum length has not been exceeded, and will not be exceeded by the addition of questions, processing proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> where the targeted questions from the currently selected HRA strategy are added to the individual&apos;s questionnaire. Flow proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> where additional members of the targeted population will be processed through stages <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. Once all members of a targeted population have been processed, flow proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, if further HRA strategies are in the database of HRA Strategies, then flow proceeds to stage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. If no more strategies are in the system, flow proceeds to state <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> where the targeted questionnaires are administered. For each member of each targeted population selected by the HRA strategies, the associated questionnaire generated in steps <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is provided to the member. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the questionnaires may be printed by computer platform <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and mailed to members, may be sent by email to the members, or may be accessed as an HTML form by the members via the Internet or corporate Intranet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Once the questionnaires have been completed, the process continues at stage <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating the entry of HRA questionnaire results and generation of feedback of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. At stage <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, completed, targeted HRA questionnaires are received by the system. At stage <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, the completed questionnaires are input into the system. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, completed questionnaires are entered either in batch form or individually. Entry may also be accomplished by computer recognition through scanned input, such as electronic form readers or handwriting recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After the entry of the completed questionnaires into the system and their subsequent storage in the database, at stage <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> one of the HRA strategies that had been administered at stage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is selected. At stage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the Tailored feedback Person Model is drawn from the HRA strategy and a query is performed on the database containing the completed questionnaire and information about the associated member of the targeted group. At stage <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, the query results in the generation of at least a portion of a feedback strategy. The strategy may include a feedback letter to be mailed to the selected individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> At stage <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, a check is done as to whether there are additional HRA strategies to be analyzed for generation of further feedback information, and, if so, processing returns to stage <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. If not, at stage <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> the process ends with the completed feedback strategy being implemented, which may include letters being delivered to the individual persons who completed the questionnaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition to the generation of feedback to enhance the lives of those involved in the programs of the disclosed invention, specific targeted, or tailored, benefits may be generated as a result of analysis of the questionnaires. For instance, in the case of a colorectal screening HRA strategy, further medical benefits may be targeted based on the results strategy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Also, the results of the analysis of the targeted questionnaire may result in the automatic generation of insurance pre-authorizations for treatment. In this way, time and money are conserved by leveraging the information gathered by the process. Also, the lifestyle of the individual member is further enhanced by the simplification of seeking and receiving medical treatment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not exhaustive and does not limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practicing of the invention. For example, the described implementation includes a particular network configuration but the present invention may be implemented in a variety of data communication network environments using software, hardware, or a combination of hardware and software to provide the processing functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that all or part of systems and methods consistent with the present invention may be stored on or read from other computer-readable media, such as: secondary storage devices, like hard disks, floppy disks, and CD-ROM; a carrier wave received from the Internet; or other forms of computer-readable memory, such as read-only memory (ROM) or random-access memory (RAM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, one skilled in the art will also realize that the processes illustrated in this description may be implemented in a variety of ways and include multiple other modules, programs, applications, scripts, processes, threads, or code sections that all functionally interrelate with each other to accomplish the individual tasks described above for each module, script, and daemon. For example, it is contemplated that these programs modules may be implemented using commercially available software tools, using custom object-oriented code written in the C&plus;&plus; programming language, using applets written in the Java programming language, or may be implemented as with discrete electrical components or as one or more hardwired application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) custom designed just for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Methods of and systems are provided for using targeted questions directed to a covered population and responses to those questions to monitor, analyze, and improve the health of the covered population. The targeted questionnaires, known as Health Risk Assessments (HRAs), are used to collect self-reported information about a person&apos;s lifestyle behaviors that can impact his or her long term health. Questions are used that are deemed appropriate for a pre-defined population of people. For example, females would not see questions asking about their prostate screening history, but they may see questions directed at pregnancy. Based on the result of these HRAs, feedback may be sent to the individuals tailored to these results. For instance, only smokers determined to be in the &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; phase of considering smoke-cessation would be sent feedback defined for those in &ldquo;preparation of smoke cessation.&rdquo; In addition, targeted benefits may be offered for those pre-determined to be at risk of future disease. For example, hemoccult self-screenings may be offered to people under the age of fifty who report having a family history of colorectal cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An example of an HRA strategy will be useful in illustrating the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A demonstration program was initiated whereby members of a test group were selected to participate as covered participants in an initial test of the present invention. The medical team decided to form an HRA strategy around prophylactic aspirin therapy as an aid in delaying and possibly preventing heart attacks. Prophylactic aspirin therapy may reduce by 50% the incidence of heart attacks, which are devastating to the victim and his or her family, as well as, expensive, incurring costs of $30,000 to $50,000 in the first year of the heart attack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The team then selected targeted questions directed at the HRA strategy of prophylactic aspirin therapy, including the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;1. Do you take aspirin daily or at least every other day&quest; (Yes/No). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> 2. I avoid aspirin because: a) I&apos;m allergic to aspirin; b) I&apos;m on anticoagulant treatment; c) I have a bleeding disorder; d) I have stomach or duodenal ulcers; e) My doctor told me not to take aspirin; f) I have recurrent gout; g) It is against my personal beliefs; h) I have tried to take aspirin, but I cannot tolerate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> 3. Which of the following apply. I do not take daily aspirin because . . . a) I see no benefit; b) I don&apos;t want to depend upon medicine; c) I have difficulty swallowing pills; d) I can&apos;t remember to take them daily; e) Although I don&apos;t have ulcers, it causes me heartburn or stomach distress; f) It costs too much; g) I haven&apos;t really thought about it; h) My doctor has never told me to take it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> 4. Please select the one statement which best describes your plans: Currently, in regard to taking a daily low dose aspirin . . . a) I do not plan to start; b) I plan to start in the next 30 days; c) I plan to start in 1 to 6 months; d) I plan to start in 6 to 12 months; e) I plan to start, but am uncertain when.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The above questions illustrate the targeted questions and the targeted questionnaire used in the experiment. Question 2 is a typical contraindication question. Question 3 is a barrier question. And, Question 4 is a staging question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Once the questions were developed, the team selected the Targeted HRA Person Model. The Targeted HRA Person Model was males over age 50 and females over age 55 with other cardiac risk factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The Tailored feedback Person Model was established in the form of a series of 18 potential form letters comprised of one or more form paragraphs. For instance, response letter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> would be sent to any member of the targeted population known as a &ldquo;Personal reason for not taking ASA male/female,&rdquo; which is a person who answered no to question one and yes to (g) of question 2. In this way, feedback would be specific to each individual. In addition, responses would vary as the questionnaire was repeated as people changed their habits of taking aspirin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The Targeted HRA Person Model was then run against the covered population. Of the 1600 individuals who were members of the covered population, over 400 of them met the criteria of the Targeted HRA Person Model. These 400 individuals were then administered the targeted questionnaire previously illustrated. And, appropriate feedback was generated by the Tailored feedback Person Model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> While implementation of the demonstration system was mostly by hand, this invention contemplates either a manual, semi-computerized, or full computerized implementation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The system and method for using targeted questionnaires according the present invention finds application in the health care industry. Specifically, the system has widespread application in the insurance industry, within corporations trying to control costs, and for any group concerned with increasing the health and lifestyle of its members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a way to significantly reduce costs associated with health care by providing meaningful questionnaires and feedback to individuals seeking to improve their health. By providing questionnaires targeted at individuals, which vary over time, the questionnaires are more likely to be completed, thus encouraging participation and review of the feedback received. Tailoring the feedback to the individual increases self-efficacy for enhancing lifestyle and improvement of lifestyle choices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It will be readily apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications of an obvious nature may be made, and all such changes and modifications are considered to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
