<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to transmission of messages with text-mode contents in a telecommunication system and particularly in a mobile system, or in a telecommunication system comprising a mobile system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition to normal speech and data connections set up on traffic channels in digital mobile systems, short text-mode messages sent on system control channels can be transmitted between actual signaling. These messages are generally referred to as short messages. In order to implement short message service (SMS), mobile systems are provided e.g. with a short message service center that forwards short messages, and stores and resends short messages that have not been delivered. The short message service center can receive a short message via any network for transmission to a terminal, or a short message formed e.g. by means of a keypad from a terminal for delivery to another terminal or some other destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Short messages can be used e.g. to transmit text-mode information between mobile system subscribers. Short messages can also be used to provide subscribers with various text-mode services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Writing of short messages with a limited keypad of a mobile station is typically slow and difficult. Furthermore, a length of a short message is usually rather limited, for example 160 characters. A possible solution to these problems is the use of various abbreviations. In other words, shortening the words to be transmitted in a short message can expedite, on the one hand, the time needed to create a short message and, on the other hand, enable more information to be fitted into a restricted message length. A problem with abbreviations is that the receiver does not necessarily understand their meaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A possible solution to this problem is use of well-known abbreviations. However, this arrangement restricts the use of abbreviations, since not all words have an established abbreviation. Furthermore, it still does not ensure that the receiver understands the abbreviation correctly since even common abbreviations may be open to interpretations or may have various meanings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to another prior art arrangement, a terminal can be provided with predictive input of text that facilitates and expedites particularly the input of text with a restricted keypad, thus reducing a need for abbreviations. A problem of this arrangement is that it does not eliminate the restriction on the message length, since the text is written out in full length already during the creation of the message. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An objective of the invention is to provide a method and an apparatus implementing the method so as to eliminate the aforementioned problems. The objective of the invention is obtained by a method and a system that are characterized by what is disclosed in independent claims <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on maintaining a database comprising definitions of correspondences between character strings, such as words and acronyms or synonyms, and replacing such character strings in the textual contents of a message to be transmitted that are found in the database with corresponding character strings before the message is delivered to the receiver. For example acronyms can thus be replaced with the corresponding full-length words. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The method and the system according to the invention have the advantage that a message can be written by means of abbreviations, which expedites the writing and enables more information to be fitted into the message. On the other hand, the receiver receives the message in an edited form, where e.g. abbreviations have been replaced with the corresponding words, whereupon the receiver does not have to know the abbreviations used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the contents of the database are at least partly specific to a sender, which means that the sender, such as a mobile system subscriber, can predetermine personal abbreviations and corresponding words, word groups or other character strings in the database. This enables the use of personal abbreviations or synonyms in writing of messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the preferred embodiment of the invention the contents of the database are at least partly specific to a receiver, i.e. the sender can predetermine receiver-specific abbreviations and corresponding words, word groups or other character strings in the database for use only in messages addressed to the receiver in question. This enables the use of receiver-specific messages or synonyms for writing messages, so that the same abbreviation can correspond to different words depending on the receiver of the message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an architectural diagram of a telecommunication system where the invention can be utilized. The telecommunication system shown in the figure comprises a mobile system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (PLMN, Public Land based Mobile Network), which is in this example a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), without restricting the invention thereto, however. The mobile system can also be e.g. a 3G system, such as a universal mobile communications system (UMTS), or then the telecommunication may comprise no mobile system at all. The GSM can also comprise services supporting more advanced protocols, such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). These services are available to users subscribing to the services and having a terminal that supports the services. A short message service center (SMSC) enables short message service in the mobile system and forwards short messages and stores and retransmits those short messages that have not been delivered. The SMSC can receive a short message via any network for transmission to a mobile station MS, and a short message formed e.g. by means of a keypad from a terminal for transmission to another terminal or to some other destination. A base station subsystem BSS provides an air interface for mobile stations MS to connect to the system. In this connection, a mobile station MS refers generally to a unit of a mobile subscriber and an actual terminal. A terminal can be any equipment able to communicate in the mobile system, or a combination of several terminals. The mobile system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further connected e.g. to the Internet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to which a terminal PC, such as a personal computer, is also connected, and to a public switched telephone network PSTN. The details of the systems disclosed above are known to those skilled in the art and therefore need not be described in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Even though the invention is described by way of an example in connection with mainly short messages, the invention is not restricted thereto but it can be applied in connection with any messages containing text-mode or alphanumeric data. Examples of other applications of the invention include multimedia message service (MMS) and various Internet e-mail messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the telecommunication system comprises a database DB, which refers herein to a system element that includes not only the actual database but also means required to transmit data to/from the database. The database is situated e.g. in the mobile system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and it can be a separate component, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or it can be associated with the SMSC, for instance. The database DB can also be located elsewhere and connected to the system via the Internet, for example. Furthermore, there can be several databases, or the database can be divided into physically separate units. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of the contents of the database DB. The database DB contains definitions of correspondences between character strings, wherein one or more second character strings STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(n)) have been defined for each first character string STRING<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing at least one character, the second character strings corresponding to the first character string. The character strings can contain letters, numerals, special characters and combinations thereof. Upper-case and lower-case letters can be processed as identical or different characters, depending on the situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also according to the invention, in a message to be transmitted from a sender to a receiver in a telecommunication system each second character string STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the database in the textual contents of the message is replaced with the corresponding first character string STRING<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> before the message is delivered to the receiver. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for instance a short message from a mobile station MS to another mobile station MS or to an Internet terminal PC is transmitted by first inputting the message normally to the mobile station MS. The message can be input by means of the second character strings STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> contained in the database DB. An address used to transmit a short message to a receiver is usually the receiver&apos;s telephone number or some other corresponding identifier. Before the message is delivered to the receiver MS or PC, a system element performs the replacement of character strings according to the definitions in the database. This takes place by checking the character strings in the textual contents of the message and replacing each located second character string STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the database DB with the corresponding first character string STRING<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, according to the database shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, character strings &lsquo;js&rsquo;, &lsquo;jsmith&rsquo; and &lsquo;john<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rsquo; are replaced with the string &lsquo;John Smith&rsquo; in the textual contents of the message. After all the located second character strings STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have been replaced, the message with the edited textual contents is delivered to the receiver MS or PC. The message can thus be written by means of e.g. the abbreviation &lsquo;js&rsquo;, but the receiver reads from the message the corresponding character string &lsquo;John Smith&rsquo;. The replacement of character strings according to the invention is advantageous e.g. in SMS-based services, which operate by transmission of a service request in the form of a short message to a particular service number (service provider), the request containing different commands and parameters, on the basis of which the service, such as information on the weather, is obtained. It is thus possible to determine a long string of commands and parameters to correspond to an abbreviation of only one or a few characters, so that the use of the service requires the subscriber only to remember the predetermined abbreviation, which will be automatically replaced with the corresponding full-length character string before the message is delivered to the service provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The system element performing the replacement is preferably the short message service center SMSC or some other similar element responsible for transmission of messages. The replacement can also be performed e.g. by the transmitting terminal, such as a mobile station MS. The functionality according to the invention in the system element performing the replacement can be implemented by suitable software, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Textual contents of a short message usually have a length of 160 characters. It is therefore possible that the textual contents of an original short message with a great number of abbreviations do not fit in a single short message after the replacement of character strings. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the textual contents are divided into two or more separate messages, which are delivered to the receiver if the length of the textual contents of the message exceeds the maximum length reserved for textual contents of one message as a result of the replacement of the character strings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The definitions in the database DB concerning the correspondences between character strings STRING<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be at least partly common, which means that they are applied to messages transmitted by any of the senders MS and PC. In addition thereto or alternatively, the definitions in the database DB concerning the correspondences between the character strings can be at least partly specific to a sender or a sender group, in which case the sender-specific or sender-group-specific definitions are only applied to messages transmitted by the sender in question or by a sender of the sender group in question. For example, the database DB can contain definitions according to which the character string &lsquo;name&rsquo; is replaced with &lsquo;John Smith&rsquo; in a message arriving from a particular sender MS or PC, but in a message from another sender the same string &lsquo;name&rsquo; is replaced with string &lsquo;Carol Jones&rsquo;. Thus, the database can preferably be edited by a system user, such as a subscriber or some other sender MS or PC of messages. The database DB can be provided with a suitable connection and a user interface for making such sender-specific definitions. Access to the database for making definitions can be obtained e.g. via the Internet or the mobile system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, depending on the system. A system user can make definitions concerning the correspondences between character strings STRING<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the database DB in any manner he/she desires. It is also possible that the system suggests abbreviations or synonyms to certain words input by the user, or the abbreviations are formed according to a predefined principle. When the user is inputting definitions into the database, it is preferably checked that the definitions contain no contradictions, or if there are any contradictions, the user is alerted. In other words, for example a user is prevented from unintentionally determining two corresponding first character strings STRING<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for one and the same second character string STRING<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, unless the user also determines different uses for the alternatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> If the database DB contains both definitions common to all the users and sender-specific or sender-group-specific definitions, the common definitions are preferably applied only to the character strings that are not provided with any sender-specific or sender-group-specific definitions. Furthermore, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention the definitions contained in the database DB concerning the correspondences between the character strings can also be at least partly specific to a receiver or a receiver group, which means that such receiver-specific or receiver-group-specific definitions are only applied to messages to be delivered to the receiver in question or to a receiver of the receiver group in question. If the definitions in the database DB are both sender-specific and receiver-specific, the user (sender) can determine, in the database, personal character string correspondences that are dependent on the addressee of the message transmitted by the user. For example, a system user can determine that in messages to a particular receiver MS or PC, the character string &lsquo;BR&rsquo; is replaced with the string &lsquo;Best Regards&rsquo;, whereas in messages transmitted to another receiver the same character string &lsquo;BR&rsquo; is replaced with the string &lsquo;Yours Sincerely&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the above examples, the term &lsquo;sender&rsquo; or &lsquo;receiver&rsquo; can refer to a mobile station MS or a terminal PC with a particular telephone number or some other corresponding subscriber identifier, or a subscriber or user using the MS or the terminal. When character strings are being replaced, the sender of the message, on the basis of which the replacement is performed, is identified e.g. based on the telephone number from which the message was transmitted. Correspondingly, the receiver is preferably determined during replacement according to an address related to the message, such as a telephone number or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The replacement of character strings according to the invention is preferably carried out in response to an indication contained in a message for performing replacement. The indication can be e.g. a predetermined character or character combination contained in the textual contents, in which case the system element performing the replacement of character strings only carries out the replacement if the message comprises the agreed indication for replacement. The indication can be located either at the beginning or end of the textual contents, for example. The indication can also be included in signaling information possibly contained in the message. In such a case, the indication can be e.g. a particular predetermined parameter value or it can be included in the address data of the message. The telephone number or the like constituting the address of the short message can contain a predetermined additional number identified by the system transmitting the message, the number operating as an indication as described above for editing the textual contents of the message according to the invention. The message can also contain data on which of the alternative definitions contained in the database DB are to be applied to the message in question. For example, when the database comprises partly sender-specific and/or partly receiver-specific definitions, the indication can also contain data on the alternative definitions to be applied in the replacement of character strings. It is also possible that a system subscriber or some other sender of messages agrees in advance with the system provider on whether the service according to the invention is applied to the messages transmitted by the subscriber, and on the terms of the replacement. It is then possible to determine that the service is applied to every message or only to certain defined messages that fulfill predetermined conditions concerning the identity of the receiver, for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover, it should be recognized that structures and/or elements and/or method steps shown and/or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
