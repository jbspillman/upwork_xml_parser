<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">It is an object to control the rotation of a motor for driving clock hands more reliably and to prevent abnormal wear and breakage of components due to an overload. When a rotation detecting circuit detects that a motor has not been rotated by a normal driving pulse, a control circuit controls the rotation of the motor with a corrective driving pulse having a pulse width greater than that of the normal driving pulse. When the rotation detecting circuit detects that the motor has not been rotated even by the corrective driving pulse, it stops controlling the rotation of the motor and notifies the fact that the movement of the hands of the clock has stopped with a notifying device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an analog electronic clock in which the rotation of a motor for driving clock hands is controlled based on a driving pulse supplied from motor control means and which displays time with the clock hands that are driven for rotation by the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Analog electronic clocks have been conventionally used including analog electronic wrist watches and analog electronic clocks in which the rotation of a motor for driving clock hands is controlled based on a driving pulse supplied from motor control means and which displays time with the clock hands that are driven for rotation by the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, a step motor is used as the motor; a normal driving pulse having small effective power and having a predetermined width is supplied to a motor driving circuit from the control means; and the motor driving circuit drives the motor with a pulse having the same width as that of the supplied driving pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In some cases, the rotation of the motor cannot be controlled by the normal driving pulse because of a drop in the power supply voltage, aging of the motor control means or a motor driving mechanism, and so on. In order to control the rotation of the motor with higher reliability even in such a case, the rotation of the motor is detected after the normal driving pulse is supplied to the motor and, when no rotation is detected, a corrective driving pulse having effective power greater than that of the normal driving pulse (for example, a width greater than that of the normal driving pulse) is supplied to the motor to rotate the motor forcibly (for example, see Japanese Patent Publication No. 18148/1988 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9865/2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, since the motor is forcibly rotated by the corrective driving pulse, a gear train for driving the motor is overloaded, which has resulted in the risk of abnormal wear and breakage of components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to control the rotation of a motor for driving clock hands more reliably and to prevent abnormal wear and breakage of components because of an overload. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, there is provided an analog electronic clock in which the rotation of a motor for driving clock hands is controlled based on a driving pulse supplied from motor control means and which displays time with the clock hands that are driven for rotation by the motor, characterized in that the motor control means has normal driving pulse generation means for generating a normal driving pulse having a predetermined pulse width, corrective driving pulse generation means for generating a corrective driving pulse having energy higher than that of the normal driving pulse and rotation detecting means for detecting the rotation of the motor and in that the rotation of the motor is controlled by the corrective driving pulse when the rotation detecting means detects that the motor has not been rotated by the normal driving pulse and the rotation control of the motor is stopped when the rotation detecting means detects that the motor has not been rotated by the corrective driving pulse. The rotation of the motor is controlled by the corrective driving pulse when the rotation detecting means detects that the motor has not been rotated by the normal driving pulse, and the rotation of the motor is stopped when the rotation detecting means detects that the motor has not been rotated by the corrective driving pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The motor control means has rotation detection driving pulse generation means for generating a driving pulse for detecting rotation, and the motor is driven by the driving pulse for detecting rotation after the rotation of the motor is controlled by the corrective driving pulse to detect whether the motor has rotated or not with the rotation detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The corrective driving pulse may be a driving pulse having a width greater than that of the normal driving pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A configuration may be employed in which there is provided notifying means for notifying the fact that the movement of the hands has stopped when the motor control means has stopped controlling the rotation of the motor.</paragraph>

A third output section of the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is connected to a notifying device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for notifying of the stoppage of the movement of the hands. The notifying device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> constitutes the notifying means, and a display device which visually notifies of the stoppage of the movement of the hands or a buzzer or the like which acoustically notifies of the same may be used. A rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for detecting whether the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated or not is connected between the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> constitutes the rotation detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The dividing circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> divides the frequency of a reference clock signal from the oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and outputs it to the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> receives the signal from the dividing circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and outputs a driving pulse to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A normal driving pulse which is a driving pulse having small effective energy and a predetermined pulse width and a corrective driving pulse which is a driving pulse having effective energy greater than that of the normal driving pulse are prepared as the driving pulse, and the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> selectively outputs the normal driving pulse and corrective driving pulse to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in accordance with a detection signal from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> constitutes the normal driving pulse generating means for generating the normal driving pulse and the corrective driving pulse generating means for generating the corrective driving pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> supplies the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with a control pulse for detecting rotation required for the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to detect the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> constitutes rotation detection control pulse generating means for generating a control pulse for detecting rotation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the dividing circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> constitute the motor control means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are timing charts in the present mode for carrying out the invention. It shows an example in which it is detected that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is not rotating as a result of detection of the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> performed by the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in response to a control pulse SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation after the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is rotated by a normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As will be detailed later, when the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> detects that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is not rotating, the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> controls the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> based on a corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and thereafter controls the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with a driving pulse Px for detecting rotation, and the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> operates to detect the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in response to a control pulse SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> N-channel transistors <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a resistor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation that is series-connected to the transistor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, a resistor <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation that is series-connected to the transistor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and a comparator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are included in the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An operation of the analog electronic clock according to the present mode for carrying out the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> First, in a motor driving period, the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is supplied from the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and, as a result, the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> controls the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the transistors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are controlled to be in an on state, and a driving current consequently flows through the coil <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> to rotate the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> At the next driving of the motor, although not shown, when the next normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied from the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the transistors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are controlled to be in the on state, and a driving current in the direction opposite to that of the driving current flows through the coil <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> to rotate the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the operation is repeated to rotate the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A rotation detecting period is provided immediately after each motor driving period to detect whether the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the rotation detecting period, the control pulse SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> is supplied from the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> controls the transistors <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to put them in the on state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in response to the control pulse SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation, and controls the transistor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> on/off in predetermined cycles with the transistors <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> in the on state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At this time, a detection voltage that develops at the resistor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation is taken out from a terminal OUT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A signal having a waveform as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is obtained as the detection voltage. When the detection voltage is equal to or lower than a predetermined threshold (Vss in the present mode for carrying out the invention), i.e., when the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is rotating, a rotation detection signal Vs at a high level indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is rotating is output from a comparator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is not rotating, i.e., when the detection voltage does not exceed the threshold, a rotation detection signal Vs at a low level indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is not rotating is output from the comparator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although not shown, in the period for rotation detection performed after the end of the next motor driving period, the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> controls the transistors <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to put them in the on state in response to the next control pulse SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation and controls the transistor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> on/off in predetermined cycles in this state. At this time, a detection voltage that develops at the resistor <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation is taken out from a terminal OUT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the detection voltage is equal to or lower than the predetermined threshold, i.e., when the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is rotating, a rotation detection signal Vs at the high level indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated is output from the comparator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is not rotating, i.e., when the detection voltage does not exceed the threshold, a rotation detection signal Vs at the low level indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not rotated is output from the comparator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In each of the rotation detecting periods, the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> receives the rotation detection signal Vs from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and judges whether the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A description will now be made on an operation in the case in which the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not been rotated by the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not been rotated by the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a rotation detection signal Vs indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not rotated is input from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Upon receipt of the rotation detection signal Vs indicating that there is no rotation, the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> judges that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not rotated and supplies a corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a width greater than that of the normal driving pulse as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> controls the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> finishes driving the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with the corrective driving pulse, it supplies a driving pulse Px having a pulse width smaller than that of the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and thereafter outputs a control pulse SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>) to the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a type which detects a voltage induced by the rotation and vibration of a rotor (not shown) included in the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and the induced voltage is not generated and rotation can not be detected in the case that the vibration of the rotor has already stopped when the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ends because the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a great pulse width. Therefore, the driving pulse Px for detecting rotation is supplied to the motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> immediately after the end of the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to vibrate the rotor of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> detects whether there is rotation or not. Therefore, the driving pulse Px for detecting rotation is formed with a pulse width smaller than that of the normal driving pulse because it is required only to vibrate the rotor of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and is not required to rotate the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The motor driving circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> drives the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with the driving pulse Px for detecting rotation. The rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> detects whether the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated or not in response to the control pulse SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for detecting rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has been rotated by the corrective driving pulse, in the same manner as described above, a rotation detection signal Vs at the high level indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated is output from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not been rotated by the corrective driving pulse, in the same manner as described above, a rotation detection signal Vs at the low level indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not rotated is output from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the rotation detection signal Vs from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated, the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> thereafter drives the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with the driving pulse returned to the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, upon receipt of the rotation detection signal Vs from the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> indicating that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not rotated even when driven by the corrective driving pulse, the control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> stops controlling the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to stop the operation of moving the hands and notifies of the fact that the movement of the hands has been stopped using the notifying device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As described above, the analog electronic clock according to the present mode for carrying out the invention is particularly an analog electronic clock in which the rotation of a motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for driving clock hands is controlled based on a driving pulse supplied from motor control means and which displays time with the clock hands that are driven for rotation by the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, characterized in that the motor control means has normal driving pulse generation means for generating a normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a predetermined pulse width, corrective driving pulse generation means for generating a corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having energy higher than that of the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for detecting the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and in that the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is controlled by the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> detects that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not been rotated by the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the rotation control of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is stopped when the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> detects that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has not been rotated by the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is therefore possible to control the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> more reliably and to prevent abnormal wear and breakage of components due to an overload. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> There is provided a notifying device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for notifying the fact that the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has stopped, and the notifying device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is configured such that it notifies the fact that the movement of the hands has stopped when the motor control means has stopped controlling the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. It is therefore possible to quickly notify a user of the fact that the movement of the hands of the clock has stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The motor control means has rotation detection driving pulse generation means for generating a driving pulse Px for detecting rotation and has a configuration in which it controls the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereafter controls the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with the driving pulse Px for detecting rotation and detects whether the motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has rotated or not with the rotation detecting circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. It is therefore possible to detect the rotation of the motor reliably even when the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a pulse having a very large width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A driving pulse having a pulse width greater than that of the normal driving pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used as the corrective driving pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the present mode for carrying out the invention, but it is possible to use a driving pulse having a great wave height value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to control the rotation of a motor for driving clock hands more reliably and to prevent abnormal wear and breakage of components due to an overload. </paragraph>
