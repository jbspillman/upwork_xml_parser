<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> voltage regulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which is provided with external terminals, namely, an input voltage terminal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a GND terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and an output voltage terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, is constituted by a reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> capable of outputting a constant voltage, a voltage dividing circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> capable of dividing in an appropriate proportion a voltage of the output voltage terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an error amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> capable of comparing two input voltages to adjust an output voltage, and an output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> capable of adjusting an impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The error amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> causes the output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to adjust an impedance such that an input voltage from the voltage dividing circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is kept equal to an output voltage of the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can keep a voltage of the output voltage terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> constant even if an input voltage fluctuates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the voltage dividing circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is constituted by resistors, and the output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is constituted by an enhancement PMOS transistor. Various external loads such as a CPU and a microcomputer are connected to the output voltage terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> according to an application of the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The voltage regulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> generates in the output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> a loss represented by the following expression (1).</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Pt</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>in&minus;<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>out)&times;<highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight>out&emsp;&emsp;(1)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Where Pt is a loss (W), Vin is an input voltage (V), Vout is an output voltage (V) and Iout is an output current (A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When the input voltage is high and the output current is large (an impedance of an external load is low), the loss increases. Usually, an allowable loss is defined for a plastic package or the like in which a voltage regulator is implemented and a user sets conditions of use not to exceed the allowable loss. Most of the loss is generated in the form of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional voltage regulator, if it is erroneously used in excess of an allowable loss, there are problems that characteristics of the voltage regulator are deteriorated and the regulator may be destroyed by generated heat. Thus, a user is required to a measurement for heat radiation and safety in order to cope with a case of the voltage regulator being erroneously used in excess of an allowable loss. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-described problems, a voltage regulator of the present invention is provided with means for detecting a loss, with which the voltage regulator can detect an increase in a loss to automatically enter a protective operation and reduce the loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The voltage regulator of the present invention is provided with a loss detecting circuit that functions so as to lower an output voltage when a loss has increased. When the loss detecting circuit is activated, the output voltage falls to decrease an output current, reducing the loss. As a result, an automatic protective function against an excessive loss is added to the voltage regulator, whereby a voltage regulator with high safety can be realized in which its characteristics are not deteriorated and the regulator is not destroyed even if conditions of use are erroneously set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a voltage regulator comprising: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> an output circuit that is controlled by an output of the error amplifier circuit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> a voltage dividing circuit that is connected to the output circuit in series, the error amplifier circuit receiving a divided voltage from the voltage dividing circuit as the other input; </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be hereinafter described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a circuit block diagram showing an example of a configuration of a voltage regulator of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is provided with a loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> between an input terminal of an error amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, to which a reference voltage generated by a reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is inputted, and a GND terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In addition, a loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided between an output terminal of the error amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and an input voltage terminal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Other parts of the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that outputs a constant voltage, the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are set to monitor a loss of an output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and to respectively have a decreased impedance only when the loss exceeds a fixed value. When the impedance of the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> decreases, a reference voltage is pulled down to be closer to a potential of the GND terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Thus, an output voltage of the error amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> increases, and the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> applies feedback in a direction in which an output voltage of the output voltage terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is decreased. In addition, when the impedance of the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> decreases, since an output of the error amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is pulled up to be closer to a potential of the input voltage terminal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an output voltage of the output voltage terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> also falls. Here, since an output current is represented by the following expression, the output current decreases when the output voltage falls. From the above expression (1), it is seen that a loss becomes small when the output current decreases.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight>out&equals;<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>out/<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>out&emsp;&emsp;(2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Where Vout is an output voltage (V), Iout is an output current (A) and Rout is an external load (&OHgr;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition, the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are set to monitor a loss of the output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and to respectively have a sufficiently increased impedance when the loss becomes smaller than a fixed value. Therefore, when the loss becomes small, the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the present invention returns to a state in which it can output a constant voltage again. In this way, since the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is added with the automatic protective function against an excessive loss, a voltage regulator with high safety can be realized in which its characteristics do not deteriorate and the regulator is not destroyed even if conditions of use are erroneously established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Here, the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can freely set an amount of loss to be detected according to a use application. In addition, the above-described effects can be obtained even if only one of the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided. Further, the loss detecting circuits may be provided in any place and may have any circuit configuration as long as they can detect a loss and lower an output voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing another example of a configuration of a voltage regulator of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A voltage regulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is provided with a reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> as shown in JP 04-065546 B instead of the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> has a depression NMOS transistor and an enhancement NMOS transistor arranged in series and outputs a constant voltage. In the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, base terminals of the depression NMOS transistor and the enhancement NMOS transistor are electrically connected with source terminals of them, respectively. However, potentials of the base terminals can be set to other potentials. For example, the base terminal of the depression NMOS transistor may be electrically connected to have a potential of the GND terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In addition, a temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is provided as an example of the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> uses an enhancement NMOS transistor and is set to electrically connect a gate and a source to be turned off. In addition, a temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is provided as an example of the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> uses an enhancement PMOS transistor and is set to electrically connect a gate and a source to be turned off. Other parts of the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are set to be usually in an off state and have a sufficiently large impedance. However, these circuits monitor heat generation due to a loss of the output circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and are set to have a small impedance utilizing heal leakage only when a temperature exceeds a fixed value. Therefore, since the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> have the same functions as the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the loss detecting circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can obtain the same effects as the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can easily adjust a temperature at which an impedance decreases by adjusting characteristics of a transistor such as its size and a dosage of impurities. Consequently, since an output voltage falls when the temperature reaches a desired temperature and an automatic protective function against overheating is added to the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a voltage regulator with high safety can be realized in which its characteristics are not deteriorated and the regulator is not destroyed even if conditions of use are erroneously chosen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition, when using a circuit such as the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the enhancement NMOS transistor in the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and the enhancement NMOS transistor in the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> may be constituted by transistors of the identical type. However, if sizes of both the transistors are adjusted and the enhancement NMOS transistor of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is set to cause heat leakage earlier, an overheat protective operation can be easily realized. In addition, although an impedance of the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is determined by a size of the depression NMOS transistor, the impedance is high in practice and only a current in the order of several &mgr;A is flowing at most. Therefore, in detecting a temperature, it is sufficient that the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> has an impedance lower than that of the reference voltage circuit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, which can be easily realized if a heat leakage characteristic of the enhancement NMOS transistor is adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is needless to mention that the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can freely set a temperature to be detected according to a use application. In addition, the above-described effects can be obtained even if only one of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is provided. Further, the temperature detecting circuits may be provided in any place and may have any circuit configuration as long as they can detect a loss and lower an output voltage. For example, diodes in a reverse bias direction in which a current does not flow may be arranged, respectively, instead of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to utilize a heat leakage characteristic of the diodes or a temperature sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a circuit block diagram showing still another example of a configuration of the voltage regulator of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A voltage regulator <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is further provided with an ON/OFF terminal <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a logic circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, which are external terminals. The logic circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is constituted by an inverter having hysteresis and an inverter. In addition, a temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is provided instead of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. The temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is the same as the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> except that its gate is connected to an output of the inverter having hysteresis of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Further, a temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is provided instead of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is the same as the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> except that its gate is connected to the output of an output of the inverter of the logic circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Other parts of the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> That is, the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> has an ON/OFF function in addition to the functions of the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. When the ON/OFF terminal <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is set to a potential of the input voltage terminal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as Hi), the gate of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> assumes a potential of the GND terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as Lo) and the enhancement NMOS transistor of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is turned off to increase an impedance. In addition, the gate of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> assumes the potential Hi and the enhancement PMOS transistor of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is turned off to increase an impedance. Thus, the regulator is turned on to output a constant voltage. On the other hand, when the ON/OFF terminal is set to the potential Lo, the gate of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> assumes the potential Hi and the enhancement NMOS transistor of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is turned on to decrease an impedance. Further, the gate of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> assumes the potential Lo and the enhancement PMOS transistor of the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is turned on to decrease an impedance. Thus, the regulator is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Here, while the regulator is in an on state, the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> have sufficiently high impedances and are in completely the same states as the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the temperature detecting circuit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Since the heat leakage characteristic is the same as a matter of course, the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can obtain the same effects as the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention utilizes the circuit configuration of the ON/OFF function and the automatic protective function against overheating is added thereto without increasing the number of a circuit. Therefore, a voltage regulator with high safety can be realized without increasing costs, in which its characteristics are not deteriorated and the regulator is not destroyed even if conditions of use are erroneously set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the present invention employs a protective system for detecting a loss, an amount of current that can be outputted varies according to an input voltage to the voltage regulator. That is, from the expression (1), it is seen that more current can be outputted until a loss reaches a certain level if the voltage regulator is used in an area where an input/output voltage difference is small. The present invention is clearly different from, for example, a protective system for detecting only a constant overcurrent and is more practical in this respect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Further, although the embodiments have been described with a CMOS transistor circuit as an example, it is obvious that the present invention can be applied to a bipolar transistor circuit and other circuit forms as well, and is not limited by the embodiments by any means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the voltage regulator the present invention, there is provided the loss detecting circuit that functions so as to lower an output voltage if a loss has increased, obtaining the effect that a voltage regulator with high safety can be realized in which its characteristics do not deteriorate and the regulator is not destroyed even if it is erroneously used in excess of an allowable loss. In addition, there is another effect that the heat radiation measure and the safety measure required of a user can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is seen that a voltage regulator is provided. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the preferred embodiments which are presented for the purposes of illustration and not of limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims which follow. </paragraph>
