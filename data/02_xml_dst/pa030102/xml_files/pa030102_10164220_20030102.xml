<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Electronic systems and methods for providing a virtual advisor are provided. Various illustrative features and displays of illustrative embodiments of the present invention are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/295,696, filed Jun. 4, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A virtual advisor may be, for example, any system that, in response to a user&apos;s queries, provides electronic advice, answers, suggestions, or any other information or combination thereof using case-based reasoning, live experts, or both. The virtual advisor may be implemented on any suitable stand-alone or distributed system (i.e., Internet-based or non-Internet-based computer network). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a virtual advisor and features thereof. The virtual advisor provides electronic advice, answers, suggestions, or any other information to users in response to their queries, using case-based reasoning, live experts, or both. In some embodiments, the virtual advisor may utilize case-based reasoning (e.g., textual, conversational, structural, etc.) to provide solutions to a user&apos;s query. Case-based reasoning is a technique whereby problems are solved using solutions to previous problems or questions (&ldquo;cases&rdquo;). These cases may be stored in a database or in any other suitable searchable electronic format, and on any suitable searchable storage device (e.g., hard disk drive, memory card, etc.). Examples of case-based reasoning systems are the engines provided by KAIDARA SOFTWARE, E-GAIN, and PRIMUS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For example, a user may enter a particular query that represents a problem or question into the virtual advisor. The virtual advisor may then search for previous cases that have features related to or similar to the current problem or question. Features that are related to or similar to the current problem or question may include, for example, parameters or other characteristics that the current query has in common with previous cases. Commonality between the user&apos;s query and previous cases may be determined by assigning predefined or weighted values to various parameters or characteristics in a user&apos;s query and comparing such values with the values assigned to stored cases. For example, in a virtual advisor for the personal care products industry, parameters and characteristics, which may be predefined or weighted, may include viscosity, PH, molecular weight, price, or any other suitable physical or nonphysical property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After analyzing the parameters and characteristics of the user&apos;s query and searching for cases that have similar features to the user&apos;s query, the virtual advisor may provide the user with one or more solutions. To further narrow the solutions provided to the user, the virtual advisor may prompt the user to enter more specific questions or information in an order that may be based upon case-based reasoning, predefined or weighted values, or both, and assigned to the advisor-prompted questions or requests for information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To enhance the advisor&apos;s ability to provide accurate solutions to user queries the advisor may store new user queries, answers to the user&apos;s new queries, and any other suitable information on the advisor&apos;s searchable storage device for use in providing solutions to subsequent user queries. To improve the efficiency in providing solutions to user queries, information stored by the virtual advisor may be organized and categorized using predefined values, hierarchical taxonomies, ordered lists, or any other suitable method for organizing and categorizing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When a solution cannot be determined using case-based reasoning, the virtual advisor may provide the user with electronic access to a live expert to receive advice on the problem. For example, the virtual advisor may establish a communications session between the user and a live expert using real-time messaging, email, Internet-based (or other network based) telephony, by automatically establishing a telephone link, or using any other suitable approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The virtual advisor may be implemented using any suitable computer-based approach. For example, non-on-line client-server or peer-to-peer based approached or, preferably, an on-line (i.e., Internet-based) approach, may be used. If desired a combination of these approaches may be used. Illustrative on-line and non-online based arrangements for a virtual advisor system are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, respectively. In the illustrative on-line arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> access devices <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may include any device or combination of devices suitable for providing Internet access to a user of the system. Access devices may include, for example, any suitable personal computer (PC), portable computer (e.g., a notebook computer), palm computer, handheld personal computer (H/PC), automobile PC, personal digital assistant (PDA), Internet-enabled cellular phone, combined cellular phone and PDA, e-book, or other device suitable for providing Internet access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Internet and application server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be any server suitable for providing on-line access to a virtual advisor web site, or other Internet-based site. Internet application server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may, for example, provide one or more pages to access devices <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> using one or more suitable protocols (e.g., Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)). The pages may be defined using, for example, any suitable markup language (e.g., Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), pages defined using Extensible Markup Language (XML), Javaserver Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages (ASP), or any other suitable approaches). The pages may include scripts, computer code, or subsets of computer code, that define mini-programs (e.g., Perl scripts, Java applets, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), or any other suitable approaches). The system may be designed using suitable modular approaches such as, for example, Java 2 Platform&mdash;Enterprise Edition (J2EE), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed component Object Model (DCOM), or any other suitable approach. Internet application server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also run a database engine suitable for maintaining a database of user information such as, for example, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle 8i, or any other suitable database engine. In practice, features of Internet and application server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be integrated into a single server, or may be distributed across multiple servers that are interconnected via Internet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Links <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may include any transmission medium suitable for providing Internet access to access devices <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an illustrative flowchart of a process for allowing a user to enter a query into the advisor and search one or more modules for solutions to the user&apos;s query. Step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may allow the user to select a primary area of interest. For example, a primary area of interest for the personal care products industry may include areas such as shampoos, conditioners, etc. At Step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> the user may be provided with an opportunity to enter a query and the opportunity to select one or more modules in which to receive information from; optionally, at step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> the user may be provided an opportunity enter one or more parameters to further define the user&apos;s query. To enter a query and a parameter, the user may utilize natural language semantics, markup language semantics, or any other suitable type of language semantics. The user may also enter a query and a parameter using one or more successive screens (e.g., parametric search), a Boolean query, any other suitable approach, or any suitable combination thereof. Any suitable user interface elements may be used such as, a reply, check-boxes, text fields, drop-down lists, or any other suitable user interface element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> After the user enters a query, the advisor at step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may determine whether the user&apos;s query is sufficiently defined. The advisor may determine whether a user&apos;s query is sufficiently defined using, for example, a predefined rule or set of rules, case-based reasoning, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the advisor determines that the user&apos;s query is not sufficiently defined, the advisor may request that the user enter additional information to more particularly define the user&apos;s initial query (step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). In some embodiments, the advisor may generate and provide the user questions in order to more particularly define the user&apos;s query. These questions may be provided to the user based upon previous entries made by the user in the current query, predefined and weighted parameters (as described in detail above), or both. For example, in a virtual advisor for the personal care products industry, parameters that may be predefined and weighted, may be PH, molecular weight, viscosity, cost objectives, or any other suitable physical or nonphysical characteristic of a product that could assist in defining and identifying information with respect to the user&apos;s query. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Once the advisor determines that the user&apos;s query has been sufficiently defined, such that the user has entered sufficient information and, if provided, all of the advisor&apos;s questions have been exhausted, the advisor may perform a search using, for example, a predefined rule or set of rules and case-based reasoning to generate a solution to the user&apos;s query (step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>). For example, a rule may include generating a solution to the user&apos;s query based on matching a certain percentage of the user entered information with information assigned to and stored in cases on the advisor system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the advisor is unable to generate a solution with respect to the user&apos;s query, the advisor may provide the user&apos;s query to live expert module <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>). For example Live expert module <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may submit a question or a problem to a live expert via a live chat (e.g., an instant message forum), e-mail, video link, or any other suitable communications medium. The user may also have the ability to submit file attachments or any other suitable electronic form of data (e.g., photographs, video, spread sheets, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, live expert module <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may capture, store, and transfer all previous exchanges between the advisor and the user to the live expert. The user may also be allowed to enter any additional information to further define his or her query to the live expert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Live experts may include persons such as in house experts, outsourced experts, or both. Such experts may be located anywhere in the world. The advisor may choose to send a user&apos;s query to a particular expert or combination of experts based upon various criteria such as, for example, expertise, cost, or any other suitable criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> After the advisor has successfully transferred the user&apos;s query and any other appropriate information to a live expert, the advisor may provide the user with a notification that the transfer was successful (step <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>). The notification may be accomplished through a variety of methods such as, for example, an e-mail, an instant message, a telephone call, a page, a teletext message, or through any other suitable communications medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If the advisor is able to identify one or more solutions to the user&apos;s query, the advisor may provide the user a list of these solutions (step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>). The list provided may fit all or part of the user&apos;s query. The list provided may also be based upon a predefined set of rules. For example, these rules may require solutions to a user&apos;s query have more than 50% of a user&apos;s defined parameters to be displayed. When such a rule is used, the solutions may be displayed, for example, with a percentage corresponding to the number of user defined parameters that have been met. The list of solutions may also show or otherwise indicate which criteria has or has not been fulfilled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the advisor provides one or more solutions to the user&apos;s query, the user may select a desired solution (step <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>). After selecting the desired solution, the user may be provided with one or more information screens (step <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>). The information screens provided may based upon the particular module or modules selected by the user in step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the information screen provided may optionally allow the user to obtain information or utilize features from any module on the advisor system (step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>). For example, when a user is provided a formulation information screen the user may obtain information related to the user&apos;s query that may be found in question and answer module <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>, troubleshooting module <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, user feedback module <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, product information module <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>, ingredients module <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>, process module <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>, definition module <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, information module <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, account management module <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, and any other suitable module provided on the advisor system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, when the user requests a formula and selects formulation module <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, as described above, the virtual advisor may provide the user formula information screen <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, as illustratively shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The virtual advisor may be used in connection with various business models. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is an illustrative example of a business model. For example, the owner of the virtual advisor system may provide system-related technical support, product-related support, or other types of support or information to a customer. A customer is any entity that utilizes the advisor system. In exchange for this access, support, or information, the customer may pay an access fee (e.g., flat fee, royalty, etc.) to access the advisor system, to receive support, or to receive information. Customers that utilize the advisor system with a predetermined frequency determined by the owner of the advisor system or the advisor system itself may be eligible receive a refund of either all or a fractional portion of their access fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the chosen business model may include the owner of the advisor system, and/or the advisor system itself, giving customers a supplier recommendation. Suppliers are entities that may be under an outsourcing agreement or other suitable agreement with the owner of the advisor system to provide, for example, technologies, products, services, or capacity that the owner of the advisor system cannot provide. In exchange for these recommendations, the supplier may pay a recommendation fee (e.g., a flat fee, a royalty, or other suitable compensation) to the owner of the advisor system. In some embodiments the recommendation fee or a portion thereof paid by suppliers to the advisor&apos;s owner may be passed along to customers in the form of a rebate, additional access, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the chosen business model may include the owner of the advisor system providing customers rebates, discounts, or other forms of monetary or non-monetary benefits. These rebates, discounts, and benefits may be offered directly from the owner of the advisor system or from a third party provider. A third party provider may be an individual or entity that purchases access to the advisor system in large blocks or other suitable units. After purchasing such blocks or other suitable units, the third party provider may repackage the blocks or units into smaller sub-units. Repackaging the blocks or units into sub-units allows individuals and entities with relatively small financial resources to obtain access to the advisor system. These rebates, discounts or benefits may be generated by the advisor system. Any rebates, discounts, or benefits offered may be tracked or monitored through a proof of purchase system or any other suitable system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The above business model examples may provide incentives to the owner of the advisor system, to suppliers, and to customers by providing increased and directed advertising, discounts, and other tangible and intangible benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thus, systems and methods for providing a virtual advisor are provided. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration rather than of limitation, and that the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
