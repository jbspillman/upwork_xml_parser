<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a receiving clock reproducing method, an estimated value of delay time fluctuation of a received signal is estimated at intervals defined by transmitting clock included in the received signal. To estimate the estimated value, an oscillator counter counts pulses of a reference clock supplied from an independent oscillator while a reading counter counts pulses of the receiving clock. The estimated value is used to control a voltage controlled oscillator for producing the receiving clock. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a clock reproducing method, in particular, to a receiving clock producing method which enables real time transmission of a moving picture signal on a network, such as a packet switching network or an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, by reducing or absorbing jitter on a received data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the network such as the packet switching network or the ATM network, the jitter is apt to occur on a transmitted signal transmitted through a transmission channel of the network. In addition, the network does not guarantee to establish network synchronization between a transmitting side and a receiving side. Accordingly, the network has a problem that delay time of the received data signal has fluctuation. That is, the received data signal has the jitter given by the transmission channel. To reduce or absorb the jitter on the received data signal, a jitter-absorbing buffer is necessary at the receiving side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Herein, the term of &ldquo;jitter&rdquo; represents a state that pulses of the received data signal deviate forward or backward from normal time positions. That is, the pulses of the received data signal has phase variation or fluctuation in this state. Accordingly, the state may be considered that undesirable phase shift modulation is provided to the transmitted signal. The undesirable phase shift modulation appears as jitter noise when the received data signal is demodulated. Thus, the jitter deteriorates transmission quality of the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The jitter is roughly classified into two types. One type is transmission channel jitter caused by transmitting the transmitted signal through the transmission channel. The other is a stuff jitter brought by pulse staffing synchronization for multiple synchronization. This invention aims to reduce or absorb the transmission channel jitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Generally, a receiving buffer different from the jitter-absorbing buffer is provided in the receiving side. To prevent the receiving buffer from overflowing, a reading clock (or a receiving clock) must be synchronized with a writing clock (or a transmitting clock). Thus, a related receiving clock producing apparatus adopts an adaptive clock reproducing method that its notion is defined by ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector) recommendation 1.363.1. According to an existing adaptive clock reproducing method, the amount of data staying in the receiving buffer is monitored and the receiving clock is controlled so that the amount of the data staying in the receiving buffer is equal to a predetermined volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The existing adaptive clock reproducing method does not consider the transmission channel jitter. Thus, it is hard to reduce or absorb considerably the transmission channel jitter on the received data signal by the use of the receiving buffer. Therefore, the related receiving clock producing apparatus provides the jitter absorbing buffer mentioned above. That is, the related clock reproducing apparatus has two buffers and is complex in structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a clock reproducing method capable of absorbing transmission channel jitter without a jitter-absorbing buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide a receiving clock producing apparatus capable of reducing transmission channel jitter included in a received data signal without a jitter-absorbing buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other object of this invention will become clear as the description proceeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of this invention, an independent clock is provided to a receiving side to produce a reference clock. An oscillator counter is counts pulses of the reference clock to produces a standard time. Reproduction of a receiving clock is made by control including calculation of delay time variation caused by jitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of this invention, a receiving clock reproducing method is used for reproducing a receiving clock without synchronizing the receiving clock with a transmitting clock included in a received signal. The receiving clock reproducing method comprises the steps of finding an estimated value of delay time fluctuation of the received signal at intervals defined by said transmitting clock, and controlling a voltage controlled oscillator according to the estimated value to reproduce the receiving clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of this invention, a receiving clock reproducing apparatus reproduces a receiving clock to read data from a buffer memory. The data read from the buffer memory is taken from a received signal and written in the buffer memory in synchronization with a transmitting clock included in the received signal. The receiving clock reproducing apparatus comprises a writing counter for counting pulses of the transmitting clock to produce a counted writing value. A voltage controlled oscillator produces the receiving clock according to an oscillator control signal. A reading counter is connected to the voltage controlled oscillator and counts pulses of the receiving clock to produce a counted reading value. An independent oscillator produces a reference clock. An oscillator counter is connected to the independent oscillator and counts pulses of the reference clock to produce a counted reference value. A controller is connected to the writing counter, the reading counter and the oscillator counter to produces the oscillator control signal on the basis of the counted writing value, the counted reading value and the counted reference value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to further still another aspect of this invention, a receiving clock reproducing apparatus reproduces a receiving clock to read MPEG data from a buffer memory. The MPEG data is transmitted via a packet switching network together with a transmitting clock in the form of packets and written in the buffer memory in synchronous with the transmitting clock. The receiving clock reproducing apparatus comprises a writing counter which counts pulses of the transmitting clock to produce a counted writing value. A voltage controlled crystal oscillator starts to produce the receiving clock after an amount of the MPEG data stored in the buffer memory reaches a predetermined value. A reading counter counts pulses of the receiving clock to produce a counted reading value. An oscillator counter counts pulses of a reference clock supplied from an independent oscillator provided at a receiving side of the packet switching network to produce a counted reference value. A calculating portion produces a digital voltage control signal used to control the voltage controlled crystal oscillator on the basis of the counted writing value, the counted reading value and the counted reference value. A digital-to-analog converter converts the digital voltage control signal into an analog voltage control signal to supply the analog voltage control signal to the voltage controlled crystal oscillator. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, description will be at first directed to a moving picture experts group (MPEG) coding/decoding system using a clock reproducing apparatus (or a receiving clock producing apparatus) according to a first embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The MPEG coding/decoding system comprises a transmitting set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a receiving set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a transmission channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connecting the transmitting set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the receiving set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The transmission channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided on a packet switching network or an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The transmitting set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an MPEG coding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an ATM adaptation layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> producing portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an ATM cell producing portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a transmission channel interface portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the receiving set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a transmission channel interface portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an ATM cell disassembling portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an ATM adaptation layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disassembling portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a jitter absorption processing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and an MPEG decoding portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As well known in the art, a service signal based on MPEG-2 standards is not directly connected to an ATM layer, but connected to the ATM layer via an ATM adaptation layer. Five types (from AAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to ML<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) are defined as the ATM adaptation layer. The AAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, AAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be used for multimedia service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provides functions suitable for data communication, file transfer, or the like. Concretely, the AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> produces a transport stream (TS) packet having a length of 188 bytes which is four times as long as that of a substantial data of an ATM cell. Because the length of the TS packet is an integral multiple of that of the substantial data of the ATM cell, the TS packet is easily converted into the ATM cell. That is, the service signal based on MPEG-2 standards is efficiently connected with the ATM layer by the ATM adaptive layer. Additionally, the ATM cell has a total length of 53 bytes including 47 bytes for the substantial data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An operation of the MPEG coding/decoding system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the transmitting set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the MPEG coding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> encodes picture data (or a picture signal) into MPEG data. The AALS producing portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces TS packets from the MPE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> data. Each of the TS packets has a fixed length of 188 bytes as mentioned above. The ATM cell producing portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> produces ATM cells from the TS packets. Each of the ATM cells has a fixed length of 53 bytes as mentioned above. The ATM cells are transmitted from the ATM cell producing portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the transmission channel interface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a transmission speed of 6 Mbps. The transmission channel interface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits the ATM cells to the receiving set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the transmission channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a transmission speed of 150 Mbps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the ATM cells are transmitted through the transmission channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, jitter occurs on the ATM cells. That is, a received signal (or ATM cells) received by the receiving set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has delay time variation or fluctuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the receiving set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the transmission channel interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives the ATM cells from the transmission channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and changes transmission speed of the received ATM cells from 150 Mbps to 6 Mbps. The ATM cell disassembling portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disassembles the received ATM cells supplied at a transmitting speed of 6 Mbps into received TS packets. The AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disassembling portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> disassembles the received TS packets into received MPEG data and a received transmitting clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the jitter is given to the ATM cells in the transmission channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. That is, the received MPEG data and the received transmitting clock from the AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disassembling portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has the transmission channel jitter. The transmission channel jitter must be absorb or reduce to decode correctly the received MPEG data. The jitter absorption processing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used to absorb the transmission channel jitter on the received MPEG data. That is, the jitter absorption processing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> absorbs the transmission channel jitter on the received MPEG data to produce a smoothed MPEG data. The MPEG decoding portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> decodes the smoothed MPEG data to produce received picture data (or a received picture signal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the jitter absorption processing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is described in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The jitter absorption processing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises a first in first out (FIFO) memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> supplies a writing clock (or the received transmitting clock) to the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to write the received MPEG data having the transmission channel jitter into the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in synchronous with the writing clock. Furthermore, the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> reproduces a receiving or reproduced clock (or a reading clock) which is used to read out the MPEG data from the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as the smoothed MPEG data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> To carry out the above-mentioned operation, the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a writing counter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a reading counter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, an independent oscillator <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, an oscillator counter <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, a CPU communication control unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, a register <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, and a digital-to-analog (DIA) converter <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> forms a controller of the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> together with the CPU communication control unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, the register <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and the D/A converter <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An operation of the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will be roughly described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The received MPEG data &ldquo;a&rdquo; having the transmission channel jitter is supplied from the AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disassembling portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the received transmitting clock &ldquo;b&rdquo; is supplied from the AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disassembling portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> divides the received transmitting clock &ldquo;b&rdquo; into two and supplies one of them to the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a writing clock. Thus, the received MPEG data &ldquo;a&rdquo; having the transmission channel jitter is written in the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in synchronous with the received transmitting clock &ldquo;b&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The other of the divided transmitting clock &ldquo;b&rdquo; is supplied to the writing counter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The writing counter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> counts pulses of the divided transmitting clock &ldquo;b&rdquo; to produce a counted writing value &ldquo;f&rdquo; representing the number of the pulses of the divided transmitting clock &ldquo;b&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When amount of the MPEG data &ldquo;a&rdquo; stored in the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> reaches a predetermined volume &ldquo;target&rdquo;, the clock reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> produces the receiving clock &ldquo;c&rdquo; with an initial repetition frequency. The receiving clock &ldquo;c&rdquo; is divided into two and one of them is supplied to the FIFO memory buffer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a reading clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The other of the divided receiving clock &ldquo;c&rdquo; is supplied to the reading counter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The reading counter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> counts pulses of the divided receiving clock &ldquo;c&rdquo;to produce a counted reading value &ldquo;g&rdquo; representative of the number of the pulses of the divided receiving clock &ldquo;c&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the independent oscillator <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> produces an independent clock &ldquo;d&rdquo; with a fixed repetition frequency. The oscillator counter <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> counts pulses of the independent clock &ldquo;d&rdquo; to produce a counted reference value &ldquo;h&rdquo; representing the number of the pulses of the independent clock &ldquo;d&rdquo;. </paragraph>

With this method, the digital voltage control signal &ldquo;cont&rdquo; are given by: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the MPEG data read from the buffer memory has deviation of 20 ppm in a case where the received MPEG data has the transmission jitter of 0.01 msec at the maximum. That is, the receiving clock reproduced by using the related clock reproducing method has the deviation of 20 ppm when received signal has the jitter of 0.01 msec at the maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> show the simulation results obtained by using the clock reproducing method of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows that the MPEG data read out from the buffer memory has slightly deviation of 2 ppm in a case where the received signal has the transmission jitter of 1.5 msec. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows that the MPEG data read out from the buffer memory has deviation of 30 ppm even if the received signal has the transmission jitter of 10 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As easily understood from FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the clock reproducing method of this invention can considerably reduce or absorb the transmission channel jitter in comparison with that of the related clock reproducing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> While this invention has thus far been described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments thereof, it will readily be possible for those skilled in the art to put this invention into practice in various other manners. For example, this invention may be applied to a common packet switching network including an Internet protocol network. Furthermore, this invention may be applied to a packet switching network for transmitting packets having variable length. In this case, the AAL<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disassembling portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> detects the length of each received data packet to notify the jitter absorption processing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the length of the received data packet.
