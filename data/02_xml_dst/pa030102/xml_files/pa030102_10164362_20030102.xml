<heading lvl="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of plant science and genetics. More specifically, it relates to improved methods for chromosome doubling in grasses. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Several chemicals and physical treatments are known to induce chromosome doubling in plant cells. For example, colchicine, nitrous oxide gas, heat treatment, amiprophos methyl, trifluralin, oryzalin, and pronamide have been used to obtain progenies with doubled chromosome number in many plant species. Those chemicals and physical treatments are also used for chromosome counting because these treatments arrest mitosis and accumulates mitotic figures in the specimens. For example, colchicine (Jamieson et al., 1986; Murata, 1983; Sallee, 1982) and cold treatment (Rayburn and Gill, 1985) have been used for pretreatment to accumulate metaphase chromosome figures for chromosome observation in various plant species. 8-hydroxyquinoline (Aguiar-Perecin and Vosa, 1985; Carvalho and Saraiva, 1993; Chen, 1969; Jewell and Islam-Faridi, 1994; Lin, 1977; Rayburn and Gold, 1982; Sachan and Tanaka, 1977), monobromonaphthalene (Kindiger, 1994; Sallee and Kimber, 1981; Sallee, 1982), mixed solutions of monobromonaphthalene with colchicine (Hadlaczky et al., 1975), and colchicine with 8-hydroxyquinoline (Ward, 1980) were also used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One application of chromosome doubling is the induction of pure lines by doubling the chromosome complement of haploids. There are many recent reports on chromosome doubling of seed propagating crops, e.g., rice (<highlight><italic>Oryza saliva </italic></highlight>L., Reiffers and Freire, 1990; Alemanno and Guiderdoni, 1994), wheat (<highlight><italic>Triticum aestivum </italic></highlight>L., Hansen and Andersen, 1998; Hassawi and Liang, 1991, Redha et al., 1998), oat (<highlight><italic>Avena saliva </italic></highlight>L. Kiviharju et al, 2000), and barley (<highlight><italic>Hordeum vulgare </italic></highlight>L., Furusho et al., 1999). Another use of chromosome doubling is to restore fertility to interspecific or intergeneric hybrids, e g., Triticum spp.&times;Leymus spp. (wheat&times;lymegrass, Anamthawat-Jonsson et al., 1997), <highlight><italic>Avena strigosa </italic></highlight>Schreb.&times;<highlight><italic>Avena magna </italic></highlight>Murphy et Terrell (Ladizinsky, 2000), <highlight><italic>Lolium perenne </italic></highlight>L.&times;<highlight><italic>Festuca arundinacea </italic></highlight>Schreb. (Pasakinskiene, 2000), and <highlight><italic>Aegilops caudata </italic></highlight>L.&times;<highlight><italic>Triticum turgidum </italic></highlight>L. (Simeone et al., 1989) Chromosome doubling is also used to overcome the crossing barrier between crops of different ploidies (Katsiotis et al., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Among treatments that have been used for chromosome doubling, colchicine has been extensively used to obtain progenies with doubled chromosome number in many plant species. Colchicine is very effective to obtain polyploids or doubled haploids in dicotyledonous species. However, in grass species, the chromosome doubling effects of colchicine are inconsistent. In grass species, the shoot meristem is more intensely surrounded by young leaves than dicotyledonous species. If colchicine is applied to the grass meristem, young leaves surrounding the shoot meristem are more heavily treated than the shoot meristem and the heavily treated leaves prevent the elongation of the shoot and result in the death of the shoot. After the death of the primary shoot, doubled sectors are sometimes observed in the secondary or tertiary branches at a low frequency. This process is laborious, unreliable and hazardous (Alemanno and Guiderdoni, 1994; Hansen et al., 1998; Pasakinskiene, 2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are several reports that describe colchicine treatments on parthenogenetically induced haploid maize (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L.) seedlings (Bordes et al., 1997; Chalyk, 2000; Chase, 1952b, 1969; Eder and Chalyk, 2002; Gayen et al., 1994). Although haploid recovery rates of 26-41% were reported, colchicine treatments were affected by the growing conditions (Bordes et al., 1997), and the recovery rates could drop as low as 0.8-3.1%. It was observed that rapidly growing vigorous haploid seedlings were more prone to colchicine injury (Chase, 1969). Also, when colchicine or other anti-microtubule substances are applied as a liquid solution, the shoot meristem and surrounding tissue are injured. As a result, in maize, the flowering time of the tassel and the ear of treated plants will not be concordant, and self pollination becomes impossible. Further, penetration of colchicine into maize shoot meristem must be facilitated by vacuum, injection or submergence of the roots (Bordes et al., 1997; Chalyk, 2000; Chase, 1969; Eder and Chalyk, 2002; Gayen et al., 1994). Therefore, generally, colchicine treatments of shoots are tedious, hazardous and produce inconsistent results (Alemanno and Guiderdoni, 1994; Hansen et al., 1988, 1998; Pasakinskiene, 2000). For this reason, there has been no reliable method to obtain selfed progenies from haploid maize plants. Generally, treatment at seedling stages will cause considerable injury on other grass species and identification of appropriate treatment using colchicine is sometimes very difficult. For this reason chromosome doubling experiments in grasses have been less successful, particularly in maize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Protocols for in vitro application of antimicrotubule agents were developed to overcome the low frequency of doubled sectors with shoot or seedling treatments (Wan et al., 1989, 1991; Hansen and Andersen, 1996, 1998; Hansen et al., 1995, 1998; Notsuka et al., 2000; Saisingtong et al., 1996; Wan et al., 1991). Several investigators have developed treatments of plant sections in vitro with colchicine or other anti-microtubule substances, e.g., trifluralin, oryzalin, amiprophos-methyl or pronamide. In these methods, dissected shoots, callus or microspores were treated with an antimicrotubule agent for a few days on a medium and plants with doubled chromosome numbers were consistently obtained. Both colchicine and amiprophos-methyl treatments proved to be effective for chromosome doubling of maize haploid calli, which were induced by anther culture. However, the application of these in vitro procedures for maize haploid breeding is rather difficult because most of the maize elite breeding lines will respond very poorly if at all to anther culture media (Byter, 1997; Petolino and Jones, 1986; Petolino and Thompson, 1987; Petolino et al., 1988). Also, in maize, male and female flowers emerge at different positions (e.g., a monoecious plant). Recent maize varieties produce only one shoot meristem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In vitro chromosome doubling methods can not be applied for maize haploid seedlings induced by stock 6 (Coe ,1959; Sarkar and Coe, 1966), stock 6 derivatives (Bordes et al., 1997; Chalyk, 1994; Eder and Chalyk, 2002; Lashermes and Beckert, 1988, Sarkar et al., 1972) or stocks carrying ig gene (Kermicle, 1969, 1971; Kindiger and Hamann, 1993). This is because in each case the haploid embryos are obtained as dry kernels. Since these methods produce haploids at relatively high rates (0.5-8%), it is necessary to develop a reliable chromosome doubling method for haploid maize seedlings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another compound that has been shown to have an antimicrotubule effect and that has been used for chromosome doubling following colchicine is nitrous oxide gas (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) (Stergren, 1944; 1954). The chromosome doubling effects of nitrous oxide gas were observed by Stergren (1944, 1954) and have been used to induce chromosome doubling in wheat (<highlight><italic>Triticum dicoccum</italic></highlight>, Khapli et al., 1960, Dvorak et al., 1973; ), wheat haploids (<highlight><italic>Triticum aestivum </italic></highlight>L; Hansen et al., 1988), barley (<highlight><italic>Hordeum vulgare </italic></highlight>L., Dvorak et al., 1973, Subrahmanyam and Kasha, 1975), red clover (<highlight><italic>Trifolium pratense </italic></highlight>L., Taylor et al., 1976), oat (<highlight><italic>Avena sativa </italic></highlight>L., Dvorak and Harvey, 1973), Russian wildrye (<highlight><italic>Psathyrostachys juncea </italic></highlight>(Fisch.) Nevski, Berdahl and Barker, 1991), potato (<highlight><italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic></highlight>L.; Montezuma-de-Carvalho, 1967) and tulip (Tulipa spp., Zeilinga and Schouten, 1968). N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O has been shown to induce partial chromosome doubling in maize shoot meristem and root tips (Kato, 1997a). Most of the prior investigations treated plants just after fertilization with 300-600 kPa nitrous oxide gas to prevent the first zygotic division in order to obtain progenies with doubled chromosome numbers. In maize, the prior methods entailed identifying haploids at the kernel stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Nitrous oxide gas, however, has often been considered to be less effective than colchicine for use with both grasses and dicotyledonous species, although some studies have suggested similar effects to colchicine (Hansen et al., 1988). Because the doubled cells induced by nitrous oxide gas tend to be outcompeted rapidly during growth. As a result, plants were treated just after fertilization to obtain progenies with doubled chromosome numbers. In this treatment the first cleavage of the fertilized egg cell is prevented by the gas and there is no elimination of doubled cells by competition. However, the occurrence of polyploids using this procedure is low. This has limited the applicability of chromosome doubling techniques in maize. In particular, this has limited the use of doubled haploids in maize plant breeding. There is, therefore, a great need in the art for novel methods of chromosome doubling in grasses and especially maize that can be used to obtain high yields of doubled progeny. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art by providing a method for the efficient doubling of chromosomes. The technique has particular applicability to grass species. In particular, the invention provides a method of using N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O treatments that can be carried out during the flower primordia formation stage of development to obtain high yields of doubled sectors on reproductive organs in plants. The technique overcomes the low yields of doubled progeny associated with the use of prior techniques for doubling chromosomes in plants, particularly in grasses such as maize. Using the technique, plants may be treated for several days under pressure with N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The technique can be used in large scale applications and has been demonstrated to be highly effective in maize, for example, for the production of inbred lines by the chromosome doubling of haploid plants. This is because, following treatment with the technique, plants remain amenable to self pollination, thereby allowing the efficient isolation of doubled haploid progeny plants. Development of inbred lines is important because heterozygous plants do not breed true. Also, inbred lines are used for the production of hybrid varieties in crops that exhibit hybrid vigor, such as maize. These types of plants are generally grown by farmers as F<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>hybrids derived from the crossing of two parent inbred lines. Development of new inbred lines is thus crucial to the development of new crop varieties. Furthermore, doubling can be used to produce polyploid plants. Such polyploid plants may have improved agronomic traits and the development of a polyploid (for example, tetraploid) series in crops, vegetables and ornamental flowers (for example, lily) would provide superior varieties which can be used commercially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Use of haploids to develop inbred maize lines has not been practically applied because of the inefficiency of chromosome doubling of maize haploid seedlings. The instant invention overcomes this difficulty by increasing the efficiency of chromosome doubling, allowing for the first time the practical application of the technique in breeding programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> I. Chromosome Doubling </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To overcome the shortcomings of prior chromosome doubling techniques, the inventor developed a technique for using nitrous oxide gas to induce doubled sectors on haploid plants. The technique results from studies carried out for the development of a high-yield technique for chromosome doubling in grasses and particularly, in maize. The new procedure induces doubled sectors on the flowers of grasses at a high rate (50-100%) without injuring seedlings. The results of nitrous oxide treatments are uniform and consistent. Carrying out the technique does not require special skills. With the technique, large number of plants (1000/day) can be treated by one person. In maize haploids, doubled sectors are induced both on the tassels and ears and self pollination is possible at 30-90% level, whereas no reliable procedure for chromosome doubling had previously been available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Nitrous oxide is a gaseous substance that induces chromosome doubling in barley, red clover, rice and wheat. In an initial study using B55 haploids, it was observed that this gas, at 600 kPa of pressure, induced doubled sectors in both the tassel and the ear of the haploid plants. From these sectors, selfed progenies were obtained. In the treatment, maize plants were placed in a sealed iron chamber (8 inch diameter, 6 feet long), and treated with high pressure nitrous oxide gas at room temperature. Unlike with a liquid solution, precise control of the intensity and the duration of treatment was possible. Also, this procedure is good for treating many haploid plants at the same time uniformly. The plants were not damaged and sufficiently large numbers of doubled sectors were produced such that self pollination of haploids was possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Various N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O treatments can be used with the invention. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, treatment may comprise treatment with about 100 kPa , 200 kPa , 300 kPa , 400 kPa , 500 kPa and about 600 kPa of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. Treatment may also, in other embodiment of the invention, include greater than 600 kPa of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, for example, of about 700 kPa, 900 kPa , 1100 kPa , 1200 kPa , 1300 kPa , and 1400 kPa or greater amounts of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. Treatment times may also vary in accordance with the invention, For example, treatment may be carried out for about 1 to about 3 days, including for 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours. Treatment may also be less than 1 day, such as about 3, 6, 12 or 18 hours, or may be greater than 3 days, including about 4-6 days. A few to several treatments may be applied on the same plant at different growing stages. The six foot length treatment chamber has been made and used to treat haploid plants. It will be understood to those of skill in the art that the concentrations may be varied in accordance with parameters used. For example, it may be necessary to consider possible genotypic effects for the response to nitrous oxide gas. Further, treatment times will vary with temperature changes. For example, if the temperature is low, long treatments are possible; for instance, treatment can be 6 days in the case of treatment of lily bulbs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Treatments at the 6 leaf stage were found to be best to induce fertile sectors on both tassels and ears in order to obtain selfed progenies. Unlike colchicine, nitrous oxide penetrates the plant tissue rapidly and uniformly. With nitrous oxide, a large number of seedlings can be treated (500-1000 seedlings) with consistent results by one person per day using multiple chambers, thus indicating the broad applicability of the procedure for plant breeding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Optimization of the procedure may allow induction of more fertile anthers on haploids derived from Oh43 and A619. Multiple short treatments of haploid seedlings surrounding the 6 leaf stage may increase the number of fertile anthers and ovules. Multiple treatments may also improve fertile sector induction on the haploids of F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>s where the inbred parent lines have widely different maturities, since each haploid will have an assortment of alleles that may differentially affect ear and tassel development time. Spontaneous fungus attack during the treatment is another problem. Additional application of the fungicide mefenoxam, which has different anti-fungus activity from Captain, may be used to prevent fungus attack during the treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> II. Application of the Technique </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One important application of the instant technique is in the breeding of crops. A particularly economically important crop for which the improvement of breeding methods is desirable is maize. Development of a reliable technique for haploid induction and chromosome doubling makes haploid breeding possible. Such a method can be utilized for rapid development of inbred lines, thereby contributing to the development of high performing varieties. The overall efficiency of haploid breeding is determined by both efficiencies of haploid induction and chromosome doubling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 1. Haploid Doubling for Breeding Crops </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In crops (for example, maize, rice, wheat and barley) pure lines are utilized as varieties or the parents of varieties. Successive self pollinations (typically 6-10 generations) are necessary for the production of pure lines, and this can take several years. The doubling of haploids can be used to shorten the period of successive generations of self pollination that are typically required for development of new varieties of true-breeding lines. Because pure lines can be induced by doubling the chromosome number of haploids, utilization of haploids has been attempted in these crops from the middle of 20th century. In haploid breeding, both the haploid induction procedure and the doubling procedure are necessary. For haploid production in maize, the stock 6 line with the embryo-endosperm marker R1-scm2 enables the induction and rapid detection of haploids. What has been lacking is a suitable method for chromosome doubling of haploids in grasses, particularly maize. The instant invention provides such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The goal of crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Standard breeding techniques take advantage of a plant&apos;s method of pollination. There are two general methods of pollination: a plant self-pollinates if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant; a plant cross-pollinates if pollen comes to it from a flower on a different plant. Some plants, such as corn (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L.) have separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively. Natural pollination occurs in corn when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the ear shoot. Manual pollination can also be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The development of a new plant hybrid variety generally involves two stages: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm sources; and (2) the selfing of the selected plants for a number of generations to produce a series of inbred plants, which, although different from each other, each breed true and are highly uniform. Where the crop is grown as a hybrid, a third step is involved comprising (3) crossing selected inbred plants with unrelated inbred plants to produce hybrid progeny (F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred plants is that the hybrid between any two inbreds is always the same. Once the inbreds that give a superior hybrid have been identified, hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained. In the self pollinating crops, such as rice, wheat, barley etc. pure lines are directly utilized as commercial varieties. Thus the pure line development is important for commercial variety development in seed propagating crops and vegetables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The selfing of plants to produce inbred lines typically involves five or more generations of selfing and selection to produce an inbred, e.g., F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rarr;S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>; S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rarr;S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rarr;S<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>; S<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;S<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>; S<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rarr;S5; S<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&rarr;S<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>etc. After at least six generations, the inbred plant is typically considered genetically pure and will breed true to type. Thus, plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, e.g., a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for each gene locus. Conversely, a cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of loci produces a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically from each other and are not uniform. The resulting non-uniformity makes performance of the hybrid unpredictable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The problem with the technique of repeated inbreeding is that it is time and labor intensive. Breeding five generations may take several years and may require significant labor and selection of progeny. Chromosome doubling of haploids represents a useful way of shortening this process by providing another way of making inbred lines. Through preparation of a haploid from a diploid heterozygous plant followed by the doubling of the haploid, a diploid plant is produced which is homozygous at each locus. The method is advantageous because of its relatively short period of development. In rice, wheat and potato, haploids have been used for breeding. In maize, however, haploids have not been employed because, using prior techniques, of the difficulty in self pollinating haploid plants that have small doubled sectors in separate male and female flowers. The instant invention allows the efficient use self-pollinations, however. This allows elimination of the repeated self fertilizations. Thus, a heterozygous plant at any generation (e.g., F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-S<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) can be used as materials for the preparation of a doubled haploid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Using the haploid doubling procedure for plant breeding, the initial stage of plant breeding is generally the same as that using standard techniques. For example, breeding is initially used to combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more starting plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by haploid breeding. One technique for combining desired genetic backgrounds is pedigree breeding. The pedigree breeding method involves crossing two genotypes. Each genotype can have one or more desirable characteristics lacking in the other; or, each genotype can complement the other. If the two original parental genotypes do not provide all of the desired characteristics, other genotypes can be included in the breeding population. Superior plants that are the products of these crosses can be selfed and selected in successive generations. At any succeeding generation, preferably when the desired genetic backgrounds have been combined, doubled haploids can be produced to make true-breeding lines. These lines may then be subject for performance analyses and either eliminated or maintained based on the characteristics of the variety developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In selecting a second parental inbred line to cross for development of a new hybrid variety, it will typically be desired to choose plants which either themselves exhibit one or more selected desirable characteristics or which exhibit the desired characteristic(s) when in hybrid combination. Corn plants (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L.) can be crossed by either natural or mechanical techniques. Natural pollination occurs in corn when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the recipient ears. Mechanical pollination can be effected either by controlling the types of pollen that can blow onto the silks or by pollinating by hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> 2. Exemplary Process for Producing Doubled Haploids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Haploid kernels can be induced by pollinating colorless aleurone plants (inbred or hybrid) with the pollen of Stock 6 homozygous for the R1-scm2 gene and other color factors. This allele of r1 conditions color in the embryo as well as the aleurone. Ninety four percent of kernels identified by this method were haploid. In comparison, R1-nj, another embryo color marker gene commonly used for haploid kernel identification (Greenblatt and Bock, 1967), could result in a misclassification rate 80% (Nanda and Chase, 1966). Because the C1-I allele is very infrequent among the U.S. dent breeding lines, the R1-scm2 color marker is used effectively to distinguish haploid kernels at the dormant stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Kernels with a haploid embryo that exhibit colored aleurone and colorless scutellum (0.5-2%) may then be separated. Among the kernels with colored aleurone and colorless scutellum, diploids and aneuploids are occasionally observed (5%). However, those non-haploids can be distinguished by their higher plant height and high fertility Kernels on the ears are dissected and if necessary germinated for chromosome counting using root tips. Chromosome number determination may be conducted using the N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O gas method (Kato, 1999a), or the method utilizing heat pretreatment (Kato, 1997b). By this method determination of chromosome numbers of 50 samples per day is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The haploid seedlings can then be doubled using the invention, for example, by treating the plant with pressurized N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O gas for 1-3 days (600-800 kPa ) at the time of flower primordia formation (4-7 leaf stage, at this stage 4-7 leaves are fully excluded from the leaf whole). At the 4 leaf stage, four elongated leaves are observable, and the tip of fifth leaf is appear at the leaf whorl (stage V3 according to Ritchie et al., 1997). At the 5 leaf stage, five elongated leaves, are observable, and the tip of sixth leaf is appear at the leaf whorl (stage V4). At the 6 leaf stage, six elongated leaves are observable, and the tip of seventh leaf is appear at the leaf whorl (stage late V4 or early V5). At the 7 leaf stage, seven elongated leaves are observable, and the tip of eighth leaf is appear at the leaf whorl (middle stage V5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Doubled sectors can be detected on tassels with fertile anthers, while in the non-doubled sector, anthers do not protrude or the rarely protruded anthers are shriveled and sterile. On a pollinated ear, doubled sectors can be detected as plump kernels. Care is necessary to determine the N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O effect from spontaneous chromosome doubling. Evaluation of the doubling effects in flowering organs can be made rapidly with the naked eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 3. Chromosome Doubling in Interspecific Hybrids in Grasses </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In some crops (for example, wheat and tallfescue) interspecific hybrids are utilized as varieties. Generally those interspecific hybrids are highly sterile. However, if the chromosome numbers are doubled they restore fertility. The invention thus also has applicability for the doubling of chromosome number of interspecific hybrids, thereby potentially restoring fertility of the interspecific hybrids. In some combinations of rice intraspecific crosses, the hybrids show sterility. For example, indica&times;japonica crosses exhibit high sterility because of their distant genetic relationships. This technique may be used to restore fertility in the crosses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 4. Production of Polyploids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The development of an efficient chromosome doubling combined with a haploid induction method also makes it possible to construct a ploidy series (n, 2n, 3n, 4n, 6n, 8n) of any given inbred line. Dosage effects in maize have been investigated utilizing B-A translocations (Birchler, 1991; 1994c), aneuploids (Guo and Birchler, 1994) and the e1 mutation (Guo et al., 1996). Establishing ploidy series of inbred lines will contribute to the research advances in this field. Those polyploids can be used as one of parent of interspecific crosses to overcome ploidy barriers between crop species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Induction of tetraploids from diploids is more difficult than obtaining diploids from haploids in maize. Successful chromosome doubling of diploids has been reported using heat treatment just after fertilization (Randolph, 1932), the e1 mutation (Alexander, 1957; Rhoades and Dempsey, 1966), or colchicine treatment of seedlings (Guenov, 1991). Among these methods, the e1 gene is frequently used (Birchler, 1994b), because the heat treatment of developing ovules and the colchicine treatment of seedlings are difficult to repeat. The induction of tetraploids in known inbred lines is difficult because successive back crossing is necessary if the e1 gene is to be used to obtain tetraploids. Consequently there are only two tetraploid inbred lines from diploid inbred lines (N6, W23) registered in the Maize Stock Center (in Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter, 1997, pp117.). Therefore, the chromosome doubling method using nitrous oxide on diploid seedlings&mdash;will enable construction of tetraploid inbred series from elite maize inbred lines, representing a significant advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> 5. Species for Application of the Technique </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The current invention could potentially be used with any plant species which is susceptible to the mitotic or meiotic disrupting effects of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O during formation of the floral primordia. However, the invention will find particular use in those species for which prior techniques have found limited utility in chromosome doubling, and particularly in grasses, including maize. Examples of species deemed especially useful with the invention include, but are not limited to, maize (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L.), rice (<highlight><italic>Oryza sativa </italic></highlight>L.), common wheat (<highlight><italic>Triticum aestivum </italic></highlight>L.), durum wheat, barley, oat, rye, sorghum (<highlight><italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic></highlight>L.), onion (<highlight><italic>Allium cepa </italic></highlight>L.), Jobs-tears (<highlight><italic>Coix lacryma-jobi </italic></highlight>L.), millet, sugarcane, lily and tallfescue (<highlight><italic>Festuca arundinacea </italic></highlight>Schreb.), Italian rye grass and any kind of turfgrass or forage grasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> III. Preparation of Haploids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Haploid plants in maize have been induced by various methods (e.g., 0.1-3%), but low frequencies (5%) of doubled sectors on the tassels have limited the feasibility of the technique. Three methods are currently available for obtaining haploids in maize: pollination by stock 6, utilization of the indeterminate gametophyte gene and anther culture. Among these techniques, the stock 6 method is the most reliable procedure to induce haploids in diverse lines (the occurrence of haploids is 0.5-2%). Kernels with haploid embryos can be identified using an embryo anthocyanin pigment marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Induction of haploids is important in plant breeding, because it allows the development of pure lines in a short period by successive chromosome doubling and selfing. In maize, where inbred lines (pure lines) are used for the development of hybrid varieties, utilization of haploids was proposed nearly fifty years ago (Chase, 1952). However, the difficulties of obtaining a large number of haploids and of chromosome doubling of induced haploids prevented doubled haploids from being widely utilized for breeding. In other crops, for example, rice, tobacco, potato, and wheat, haploid breeding is conducted to some extent. The three general methods to induce haploids in maize are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> 1. Anther Culture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Successful anther culture of maize was first reported in China (Anonymous, 1975; reviewed by Wan and Widholm, 1993), and the method to improve the response from anther culture was investigated further (Barloy et al., 1989; Dieu and Beckert, 1986; Genovesi and Collins, 1982; Mitchell and Murigneux et al., 1993; Petolino et al., 1988; Petolino 1991; Petolino and Thompson 1987). Methods to induce chromosome doubling in anther culture have been investigated using colchicine and antimicrotubule herbicides (Saisingtong et al., 1996; Wan et al., 1989; 1991), and many doubled haploid lines from regenerated plants have been established (Murigneux et al., 1993). Improvement of anther culture response was accomplished by crossing regenerated plants with each other (Petolino et al., 1988). Anther culture is very productive to induce haploids in particular lines. The problem is that many maize elite inbred lines do not respond or very poorly respond to the anther culture media, and the procedure is rather cumbersome as a breeding technique. Also, in maize, during the regeneration process, the plants tend to exhibit abnormal growth (tassel seed, or female sterility) so selfing is often difficult. Because of these features, anther culture is not readily applicable to maize breeding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> 2. Parthenogenesis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Parthenogenesis is a phenomenon where an unfertilized egg develops into a haploid embryo. Normal maize plants produce parthenogenetic haploids in progenies at a frequency of 0.1% (Chase, 1949). Historically, the first maize haploids were obtained through parthenogenesis and in the early days of maize research, spontaneous haploids resulting from parthenogenesis were the only source (reviewed by Chase, 1969). Subsequently, the embryo-endosperm marker, R1-nj, was introduced, which enabled haploids to be distinguishable from normal kernels (Greenblatt and Bock, 1967; Nanda and Chase, 1966). In this system, R1-nj conditions purple pigmentation in both the aleurone layer and scutellum; therefore kernels with haploid embryos exhibit colored aleurones with colorless embryos when R1-nj is used as a male parent onto the recessive r1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A high haploid inducing line, Stock 6, was discovered by Coe (1959), with an incidence of parthenogenesis of 2.5-3.0% in selfed progenies and 0.5-2.0% when the pollen is crossed to other stocks (Coe and Sarkar, 1964). While both male and female effects were detected, the pollen has the primary role to induce haploids and the trait is heritable (Sarkar and Coe, 1966). Efforts to increase the haploid-inducing ability have been made and a few highly-haploid-inducing lines have been developed (Aman and Sarkar, 1978; Chalyk, 1994; Lashermes and Beckert, 1988; Sarkar et al., 1972). The problems with these methods were low haploid incidence (1-5%), and difficulty with inducing chromosome doubling on haploid seedlings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The results presented below demonstrate the effectiveness of identifying haploid kernels at the dormant stage using the R1-scm2 color marker. This allele of r1 conditions color in the embryo as well as the aleurone. Ninety four percent of kernels identified by this method were haploid. In comparison, R1-nj, another embryo color marker gene commonly used for haploid kernel identification (Greenblatt and Bock 1967), could result in a misclassification rate 80% (Nanda and Chase1966). Because the C1-I allele is very infrequent among the US dent breeding lines, the R1-scm2 color marker is used effectively to distinguish haploid kernels at the dormant stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 3. Indeterminate Gametophyte </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In maize, a very rare phenomenon exists wherein a sperm cell enters an ovule and develops into a haploid embryo. The phenomenon is called androgenesis, and the frequency is only {fraction (1/80,000)} in normal lines (Goodsell, 1961). The gene called indeterminate gametophyte (ig), discovered by Kermicle (1969; 1971), induces a high frequency of androgenesis. The stock with the ig mutation bears androgenic haploids at a frequency of 0.1-1%. Both heterozygous and homozygous ig produce haploids because ig works gametophytically. The irregular structure of the female gametophyte induces several pleiotropic effects including the occurrence of androgenesis (Lin, 1978). This method is utilized to introduce cytoplasmic male sterility into inbreds by backcrossing (Kindiger and Hamann, 1993). This may provide a haploid frequency up to 8%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 4. Summary </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Among these three procedures, parthenogenesis using a haploid inducing line is considered to be most useful in breeding programs, where vast number of lines and progenies have to be evaluated every year. The difficulty of chromosome doubling which had prevented the widespread use of parthenogenesis is solved by the current invention. However, the low frequency of haploid inducing frequency is still the problem for wide application of parthenogenesis for haploid breeding. Further improvement of haploid induction frequency are needed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Breeding System for Production of Doubled Maize Haploid Inbred Lines </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a system for inducing doubled sectors on flowers of grasses to obtain progenies with doubled chromosome number. The system is useful, for example, to obtain diploid plants from haploids at a high frequency in grasses. In maize haploids, self pollination becomes possible using this system. An exemplary procedure for doubling maize haploids that was used to produce doubled haploid plants is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Maize haploids were induced by the stock 6 procedure (Coe 1959) and separated by the color marker R1-scm2 (Kato, 1999c). The procedure was demonstrated using haploids produced for the maize inbred lines B55 (Iowa Agric &amp; Home Econ Exp Stn., Iowa) and Oh43 (Ohio Agric Res &amp; Dev Ctr, Ohio, 1949). Haploid seeds were surface sterilized with the fungicide Captan and germinated in moist vermiculite at 30&deg; C. for two days. The germinated seeds were planted at the edge of a small pot filled with ProMix (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The seedlings were treated at various stages from the 4 leaf to 8 leaf stage with nitrous oxide gas as described below. Prior to treatment, the seedlings were placed horizontally in a cartridge made of cardboard or, more preferably, a plastic carpet (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Application of a water mist to the plastic carpet may be used to prevent the occurrence of a static charge. Then the cartridge was introduced into a nitrous oxide chamber (20 cm in diameter and 180 cm in length with silicone rubber packing) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The chamber was made from steel pipes and flanges designed for industrial use. Two 3 foot long pipes with flanges at both sides were connected to each other with 8 bolts to form the chamber. Iron covers were applied at the both ends. One end cover had a valve and a pressure gage. The chamber was preferably earthed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The chamber was filled with nitrous oxide gas at the pressure of 6 atm (600 kPa ) for two days at room temperature. Application of a fungicide solution on the soil (e.g., Captan) was preferable before treatment to prevent possible fungus attack on roots. Survival rate could be increased by application of the fungicides Metalaxyl or Mefenoxam combined with Captan. A lesser amount of moisture in the soil was found to be preferable at this time to avoid root injury. Because the gas from the tank was very cold, use of a long introductory tube (5 m) submerged in water was made to warm up the gas before introduction into the chamber. Application of paper wrapped moistened calcium hydroxide was also preferable to absorb accumulating carbon dioxide in the chamber. The maize plants survived rapid air pressure change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> After N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O treatment the seedlings were kept at warm temperature (20-25&deg; C.) in the greenhouse for two to three days and transplanted to the field or pots in the greenhouse. Most of treated plants will recover without special care. But some treated plants (10%) were sensitive to drought following treatment, thus they were shaded or covered with a polyethylene bag if necessary upon transplantation. The plants were then grown and self pollinated. Cultivation and self pollination methods were the same as for diploid maize plants. However, where possible, growing plants in a greenhouse was found to be preferable to obtain maximum harvest. The results of the analysis are given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As can be seen, treatment at the 5-7 leaf stage (e.g., the flower primordium formation stage), was found to provide the greatest number of both doubled sectors and kernels per ear. Using the technique, 70-90% of B55 haploid plants could be self pollinated. This represents a significant advance over the previously used colchicine treatments, which yielded an estimated selfing rate of between 5-15%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Kernels with haploid embryos were induced using the maize line stock 6 (Coe 1959). Pollen of stock 6 has the ability to induce haploids (Sarkar and Coe 1966) on the ears of diverse maize lines at a frequency (0.5-3%). Four inbred lines (A619, B55, B73, and Oh43 ) and four hybrids (B55&times;A619, B73 R1-scm2&times;A619 R1-scm2, Oh43&times;Mol7, and W22&times;W23) were used as seed parents. B73 was included because this line shows a high frequency of spontaneous chromosome doubling. After detasseling, the ears of the seed parents were pollinated by stock 6 R1-scm2, bz2 (made by successive back crossing of stock 6 to a line carrying R1-scm2, bz2, that was obtained from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center, Urbana Ill. U.S.A., //www.aces uiuc.edu/maize-coop/). The R1-scm2 gene induces deep purple pigmentation in both the aleurone layer of the endosperm and the scutellum of the embryo (Kato, 1999b; Kermicle, 1971; Robertson, 1984). Haploid kernels were detected as having colorless scutella and purple aleurone. A portion of pericarp over the scutellum was peeled to facilitate the determination if necessary. For the hybrid B73 R1-scm2&times;A619 R1-scm2, the pollen of stock6 C1-I was used. The gene, (C1-I, is a dominant anthocyanin color inhibitor. In this case, haploid kernels were detected as having colorless aleurone and colored embryos (Coe and Sarkar 1964). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> About 30-100 ears were pollinated to produce 50-200 haploid kernels of each line. In the haploid detection system using stock 6, R1-scm2, as a pollinator, a small portion (5.7%) of identified kernels were hypoploids, diploid hybrids, or spontaneous doubled haploids. Those haploids and non-haploids were identified using the following criteria: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Haploids&mdash;narrow leaves, white stripes in the leaves, short plant height, high sterility in both tassel and ear. Occasional sectorial restoration of fertility on the tassel and ear (Chase 1969). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Hybrids&mdash;presence of hybrid vigor, high fertility of both tassels and ears, absence of sectorial sterility, segregation of purple aleurone color (R1-scm2 and r1), and yellow and white endosperm (Y1 from seed parents and y1 from stock 6) on the selfed ears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Hypoploids&mdash;high fertility of tassel, absence of sectorial sterility or fertility, semisterile condition of the selfed ear, and segregation of yellow and white endosperm (y1, from stock 6) on the selfed ears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Spontaneous doubled haploid&mdash;high fertility of both tassels and ears, lack of hybrid vigor, no segregation of kernel type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The haploid kernels were treated with the fungicide Captan and germinated in moist vermiculite at 30 <highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>C. The germinated seeds were transferred to small plastic pots filled with ProMix, a peat moss based growing medium (Hummert, St. Louis, Miss.). The seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for one to four weeks. Stock 6 induced 1-5 putative haploid kernels per ear (purple kernel with white embryo or yellow kernel with purple embryo) on all genotypes. A total of 715 putative haploid kernels were planted for the experiments. Most of them (94%) were determined to be haploid from their morphology and high sterility. The remaining 4.7% were misclassified F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>s, 1.1% were hypoploids, and 0.3% (one plant induced from B73 and one plant from Oh43&times;Mol7) were spontaneous doubled haploids. Among 623 haploids used in the experiments, 450 haploid seedlings were treated with nitrous oxide gas; 92% survived the treatment. In a second study, fourteen out of 50 treated Oh43 haploid seedlings died from fungus attack. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Determination of the Optimal Treatment Stage to Induce Fertile Sectors on Haploids </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Haploid seedlings induced from inbred lines Oh43 and B55 were treated with nitrous oxide gas (600 kPa&plus;100 kPa air, 2 days, room temperature) at the 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 leaf stage. Leaf stages were defined as follows, At the 3 leaf stage, there are three elongated leaves and the tip of the fourth leaf appears at the center of the leaf whorl. This stage is defined as V2 according to Ritchie et al. (1997). At the 8 leaf stage, there are 8 elongated leaves and the tip of the 9th and 10th leaves appear at the center of the leaf whorl (late V5 stage). At the 6 leaf stage, six elongated leaves are observable, and the tip of seventh leaf appears at the leaf whorl (late V4 or early V5 stage). Nine to sixteen haploid plants were treated at each stage using a large air tight iron chamber (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Up to fifty seedlings can be contained and treated with nitrous oxide gas in this size of chamber (20 cm inner diameter, 180 cm in length, with silicone rubber packing). Moistened calcium hydroxide (50 g) wrapped in a paper towel was included to absorb carbon dioxide that is produced by the seedlings, as carbon dioxide at high concentration will injure the seedlings during the treatment. The soil of the pots was dried prior to treatment to prevent root injuries. Because nitrous oxide gas is very cold when it is released from the tank, a water submerged plastic pipe (5 m) was used to warm the gas. The gas was introduced slowly into the chamber over a 10 minutes time frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> After the treatment, seedlings were transplanted into larger pots, and grown in a greenhouse. A relatively cool temperature (below 25&deg; C.) was maintained to permit the appropriate development of doubled sectors. At flowering, the ears were cross pollinated by an appropriate pollen source to reveal all the fertile sectors on the ears. On the treated plants, plant height (cm), tassel size (cm), number of tassel branches, ear length (cm), the number of fertile sectors on a tassel and an ear, the number of anthers on a tassel, and the number of kernels on an ear were recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Analyses of variance and Duncan&apos;s Multiple Range Tests were performed to determine the effects of treatments on the plant height (cm), tassel size (cm), and ear length (cm). Chi square tests were used to determine the effects of treatments upon the proportion of plants that developed fertile tassel and ear sectors. The ratios of untreated plants with fertile sectors were used to estimate the significance of the ratio of treated plants with fertile sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The numbers of fertile sectors, anthers and kernels were not normally distributed because of the high ratio of non-fertile tassels or ears and variable sizes of the sectors. Nonparametric tests were performed to compare the distributions. The primary test was the Kruskal-Wallis test. In the initial tests, the null hypothesis considered was that the distributions would be the same for each treatment and control. If the null hypothesis was rejected (P&lt;0.05), then pair wise comparisons of each treatment to the control using Dunn&apos;s method were conducted. The tassel branch number was low incidence count data and was analyzed using the same nonparametric tests mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Treated plants were shorter and had smaller tassels with fewer tassel branches compared to the controls (Table 1). The reduction in tassel branch number was especially conspicuous with the B55 haploids treated at the 5-7 leaf stages. The plant height was reduced at the 8 leaf stage and the tassel size was reduced at the 7-8 leaf stages. Some B55 haploids in the control were infected with root rot during mid-growth and this resulted in reduced plant height and ear length. Oh43 haploids experienced plant height reduction from treatments at all stages, tassel size reduction from treatments at the 6-8 leaf stage, and tassel branch number reduction from treatments at 3-5 leaf stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Significant increases in the occurrence of fertile sectors on tassels and ears were observed for B55. B55 haploids treated at the 4-8 leaf stage showed a significant increase in the ratio of plants with fertile sectors, the number of fertile sectors on a plant, the number of anthers per tassel, and the number of the kernels produced (Table 2, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The maximum number of anthers in B55 was produced on the 6 leaf stage treatment plants with an average of 521 anthers/tassel (range 36-1178). In contrast, only 2.2 anthers/tassel were produced in the control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In Oh43 haploids, only the tassels showed a significant increase of fertile sectors. These increases were observed on the plants with the 5-8 leaf stage treatments. With the 6 leaf stage treatment, all plants treated produced anthers (5.3 anthers/plant in average, range 1-16). Even so, the 5 leaf stage treatment produced the maximum number of anthers (19.7 in average, range 0-146). Only 0.2 anthers/tassel was observed in the control. The 3 and 4 leaf stage treatments yielded no significant increases of fertility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The stage-specific effects of nitrous oxide gas to induce fertile sectors in the reproductive organs of treated haploids were demonstrated. Treatment of maize Oh43 haploids at the 3-4 leaf stage had no effect for increasing the fertile sectors on either tassels and ears. Oh43 haploids treated at the 5-8 leaf stage had a significant increase in the number of fertile tassel sectors. The 6 leaf stage appeared to be best for doubling haploids because of the higher ratio (100%) of fertile tassels relative to other treatment stages. Nitrous oxide gas treated B55 haploids produced a larger number of anthers (35.6-521/tassel 3-8 leaf stage treatments) than Oh43 counterparts (0-19.7/tassel 3-8 leaf stage treatments). Also the number of kernels on the ears (10.9-49.0) was greater than those of Oh43 (0.5-18.6). Further, B55 haploids responded to the nitrous oxide gas treatment and produced fertile sectors even at the 3 leaf stage. For B55 haploids, the 5-7 leaf stages appear to be better for seed production by selfing because of the significantly higher frequency of fertile sectors on the tassels (100%), larger number of anthers on the tassels (140-521/tassel), and larger number of kernels on the ears (40.4-47.5/ear). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The difference between B55 and Oh43 haploids illustrated the existence of a genotypic effect on the response to nitrous oxide gas treatment. However, the fact that both B55 and Oh43 responded to nitrous oxide gas and exhibited a significant increase of fertility at the 5 to 7 leaf stage treatments indicated the broad applicability of the technique. These same plants experienced significant reductions in tassel branch number and tassel size (Table 1). These phenomena indicate that the shoot meristems of plants at the 5-7 leaf stages are undergoing tassel branch differentiation. The ineffectiveness of the 3-4 leaf stage treatments may indicate that cells destined for tassel branches or glumes are not yet mitotically active. In the dormant maize embryo, the tassel and ear are each determined by only 2-4 cells (Coe and Neuffer 1978; Poethig et al. 1990). This suggests that further proliferation of these cells is delayed until after the 4 leaf stage. An alternative explanation is that the cells affected by nitrous oxide at 3-4 leaf stage are eliminated during development by cell competition. The significant reduction in tassel branch number at the 5 leaf stage suggests that the cells destined to form tassel branches failed to proliferate as a result of the nitrous oxide gas treatment. Prevent this failure of proliferation may be possible to by shortening the period of the treatment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Doubled Haploid Production Trial on Haploids of Eight Different Origins </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Based on the initial results, treatments at the 5-7 leaf stages were selected for further testing. In order to identify the best stage, and to examine the potential for doubled haploid production by the nitrous oxide gas treatment, haploids of eight different origins (induced from the four inbreds, A619, B55, B73, and Oh43, and the four hybrids, B55&times;A619, B73 R1-scm2&times;A619 R1-scm2, Oh43&times;Mol7 and W22&times;W23,) were treated with nitrous oxide gas (600 kPa&plus;100 kPa air, 2 days, room temperature) at the 5, 6 or 7 leaf stage. Ten to nineteen plants were treated for each plot. Self pollinations were conducted on these treated haploids if there were fertile sectors on the tassel. Pollen grains were collected carefully on a sheet of paper and transferred to the silks repeatedly. Silks and husks were cut back prior to pollination in order to permit maximum seed set. The numbers of fertile tassel and ear sectors, as well as the numbers of anthers and selfed kernels were recorded. Statistical analyses were as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The combined data (Table 3, total/average) indicated that the nitrous oxide gas treatment has a positive effect on all the fertility related traits examined. The 6 leaf stage treatment gave the maximum number of doubled haploid progenies (44%, 39 out of 90). This treatment also gave the highest number of anthers (74.3/tassel). In the control, 11% of the plants gave doubled haploid progenies. The data of the haploids derived from B55 and B55&times;A619 were exempted from the total/average, the ratio of the haploids with anthers (56-74%, 5-7 leaf stage), the number of fertile sectors on the tassels, the number of fertile anthers, and the ratio of haploids with selfed kernels (selfing rate 32-35%, 5 and 6 leaf stage). Figures for the treated plots were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than the control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Of the 8 individual haploid lines, 5 exhibited a significant increase of fertility on the reproductive organs. Haploids derived from B55 produced the highest number of fertile anthers and kernels. Further, all the B55 haploid plants treated at the 6 leaf stage produced anthers (380 in average, range 115-747) and 90% of the plants produced selfed kernels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, </cross-reference>61.6 kernels/ear in average, range 0-104). The haploids derived from B55&times;A619 also produced a significantly greater number of fertile anthers and more plants with selfed kernels than the controls. The haploids induced from Oh43, A619&times;B73, and Oh43&times;Mol7 also responded to nitrous oxide gas treatment and about 30% of the treated haploids produced double haploid progenies after self pollination. However, the number of kernels on the selfed progenies were fewer than that of B55 haploids treated with nitrous oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> There was no significant effect of nitrous oxide gas treatment on fertility of the haploids derived from A619, B73 and W22&times;W23. The ratio of untreated plants with fertile anthers in W22&times;W23 haploids (55%) was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01) than all lines except B55 and Oh43. The number of spontaneous fertile sectors and anthers on the tassel of W22&times;W23 haploids was significantly higher than for A619&times;B73 and B55&times;A619 haploids (P&lt;0.01, Table 3). W22&times;W23 and B73 haploids showed higher successful doubled haploid recovery rates (22-32%) without treatment, whereas other lines show only 4-8% successful doubled haploid recovery rates. The successful selfing rates were not significantly different among the lines tested. B73 haploids treated at the 7 leaf stage had deformed ears and delayed silk emergence, as a result self pollinations were difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> There are three types of responses to nitrous oxide gas treatment, which are characterized by the haploids of B55, Oh43, and W22&times;W23 (Table 3). The B55 haploids responded well to nitrous oxide gas and produced the largest number of anthers and kernels after the treatment. Self pollination became feasible only after nitrous oxide treatment and the successful self pollination rate was very high (90-100%). Data from haploids derived from A619&times;B55 indicated that responsiveness of B55 was heritable. The Oh43 haploids responded less well to nitrous oxide gas, but still experienced a significant increase of fertile sectors. The self pollination success rates were improved after treatment (20-30%), but the rate was much lower than for B55. The Oh43&times;Mol7 and A619 haploids behaved similarly. A619 shares 75% genetic constitution with Oh43 (Gerdes and Tracy 1993). The W22&times;W23 haploids had the highest spontaneous chromosome doubling rate on the male side. A high rate of self pollination was possible without nitrous oxide gas treatment, so the effect of treatment was not clear. The haploids of B73 behaved similarly. A high occurrence of fertile sectors due to spontaneous chromosome doubling has been reported among 282 haploids both on tassels and ears with a successful selfing rate of 12% (Chase, 1952a). This frequency is very close to the successful selfing rate of the combined untreated controls (11%) reported here (Table 3). A genotype that had a high occurrence of fertile sectors on ears has also been reported (Chalyk, 1994). Although there seems to be tendency toward spontaneous chromosome doubling on maize haploid seedlings; the rate is not sufficient for reliable production of doubled haploids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The results revealed the effectiveness of nitrous oxide gas treatment at the flower primordia formation stage to induce fertile sectors on the reproductive organs of haploids. This technique may also be used for other monocots such as rice, onion, etc. In these species, colchicine treatment at the seedling stage is difficult or ineffective. This procedure may be used to restore fertility of interspecific hybrids.
