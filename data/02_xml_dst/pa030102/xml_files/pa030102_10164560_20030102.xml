<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a photographing device, recording medium, program, camera and camera production method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An operation button arranged on a photographing device such as a silver halide camera, or digital camera is made to fixedly correspond to a control sequence by which a predetermined function of the photographing device is conducted, and when a certain button is pressed down, the photographing device conducts a predetermined function according to the corresponding control sequence. For example, in the photographing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an operation button S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a power button, operation button S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a release button, operation button S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a zoom button on a tele side, operation button S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a zoom button on a wide side, and when the operation button S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is pressed down, the camera conducts the zooming to the wide side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, for the operation button, the function corresponding to the operation of the operation button is fixedly set by the internal structure and program of the photographing device. Therefore, for example, in the photographing device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when a type of a camera in which the operation button S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the tele side zoom button, operation button S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the wide side release button, operation button S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the power button, and operation button S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is the release button, is produced, the internal structure and program are individually designed and produced corresponding to that. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, there is a kind of a camera in the photographing device in which, when a predetermined operation button is pressed down, the power source is turned on/off, or a kind of camera in which, by the opening/closing of a slide type lens barrier, the power source is turned on/off, however, even in a case where these photographing devices are produced, respectively proper internal structure and program are designed and produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in the case where a plurality of kinds of cameras are produced by changing the function which is conducted when a certain operation button is operated, or the power source switching method, when the internal structure and program are newly designed for each kind of camera and the production process is provided separately, there are problems that the cost is increased, and the production process or inventory control becomes complex. Further, in order to satisfy the diversification of the user needs and decrease of the cost, the various developments are made conventionally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the lineup of the various products at low cost, a method of common using of the parts among many kinds of products is used. In the method of commonly using the parts, the parts of the range which can commonly use among products, are commonly used, and in order to make the difference in the function, by producing only parts which can not be commonly used, for each product, the part cost and assembling cost can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, there is a limit in the cost reduction depending on such the common using of the parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> That is, for the part which can not be commonly used, it is necessary that the metallic die is made for each part, and further, the assembling process is necessary for each different part, and the increase of cost is inevitable. Further, it is necessary that a different control section is provided for each function, and it results in a factor to hinder the cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the diversification of the user needs advances, and there is a tendency that the variation of the individual level is requested, and there is a tendency that the quick response to the changing needs is requested. When the different parts for each need are newly used and respond to such the needs, it is not only necessary that the metallic die is newly produced for each need, but it is also necessary that the production process is made different for each need, and there are many cases that the quick response is difficult, and the cost is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The first object of the present invention is, in the photographing device, that the function of the operation button or the power source switching method can be set without changing the internal structure and program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The second object of the present invention is to provide a camera and a production method of the camera, wherein both of the low cost and quick response are satisfied to the diversification of the needs of the consumer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the switching of the power source ON/OFF of the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored, and when a predetermined operation button is operated, &ldquo;0&rdquo;, and when ON/OFF is turned by the condition detection SW by the open and close of the slide type leas barrier B, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The operation unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is structured by each of operation buttons S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the slide type lens barrier B which are provided on the upper surface and rear surface of the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Each of operation buttons S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> outputs the operation signal to the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>When the operation signal is outputted from the operation button, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>conducts the function (control sequence) which is set by corresponding to the operated operation button. The slide type lens barrier B turns ON/OFF of the condition detection SW by opening and closing when &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored in the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>turns ON/OFF of the power source by the state detection signal inputted from the condition detection SW. Each of operation buttons S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the operation unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has the function as the operation members described in Claims in the present invention. Further, the slide type lens barrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the function as the mechanical section described in Claims of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The photographing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is structured by a photographic optical system, not shown, photographic optical system drive circuit, CCD (Charge Coupled Device), CCD drive circuit, and A/D converter, and when a predetermined operation button of the operation unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is pressed down, according to the command of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the photographic processing is conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation will be described. Referring to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the function setup conducting processing conducted by the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the power source is turned on in the photographing device in S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to the operation button/function correlation table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, develops on the RAM <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>the information relating to the function which is correlated with a port corresponding to the operation button in the operation button/function correlation table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and sets the function (control sequence) to be conducted when the operation button is operated (step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Next, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and develops the power source flag onto the RAM <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Herein, &ldquo;0&rdquo; shows that the power source is set so that it is detected by the operation signal of a predetermined operation button, and &ldquo;1&rdquo; shows that it is set so that the power source is detected by the condition detection switch by the opening and closing of the slide type lens barrier B. Next, the photographing processing will be described. Initially, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to the power source flag developed onto the RAM <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>When it is judged that &ldquo;0&rdquo; is stored in the power source flag (step S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>observes the pressing signal inputted from the operation button (hereinafter, called power button) to which the power source function is set in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). When the pressing signal is inputted from the power button (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; YES), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>waits the releasing of the pressed power button (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). When the power button is released (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; YES), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>switches the power source to the ON status, and goes to the photographic ready state (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> When the power source is in the ON status, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>observes again the pressing signal inputted from the power button (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). When the operation signal from the other operation button except the power button is inputted (step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; YES) without the pressing signal from the power button being inputted (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>; NO), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>reads the program corresponding to the function set to the operated operation button from the ROM <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and conducts the control sequence of the function (step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). In the step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, when the operation signal from the other operation button except the power button is not inputted (step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; NO), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>returns to step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and observes the pressing signal from the power button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, when the pressing signal is inputted from the power button (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>; YES), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>goes to step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and waits that the pressed power button is released (step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). When the power button is released (step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>: YES), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>switches the power source to the OFF status (step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), and returns to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and repeatedly conducts step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> until the electric power of the turned-on battery is consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the one hand, when the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, judges that &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored in the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>observes the condition detection SW (step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which is switched by interlocking with the open and close state of the slide type lens barrier B. When the slide type lens barrier B is in opened state, and the condition detection SW is switched to ON (step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>; YES), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>switches the power source to ON state, and goes to the photographic ready state (step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the power source is in ON state, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>observes again the condition detection SW which is switched by interlocking with the open and close state of the slide type lens barrier B (step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). When the operation signal from the operation button is inputted (step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; YES) without the condition detection SW being switched (step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; NO), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>reads the program corresponding to the function set to the operated operation button from the ROM <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and conducts the control sequence of the functions (step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). In step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, when the operation signal from the operation button is not inputted (step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; NO), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>returns to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and observes the condition detection SW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, when the slide type lens barrier B is in closed state, and the condition detection SW is switched to OFF (step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; YES), the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>goes to step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and turns the power source OFF. Then, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>returns to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and repeatedly conducts S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> until the electric power of the turned-on battery is consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the case where the turned-on battery is taken out when the electric power of the turned-on battery is consumed, because the correspondence of the operation button with the function set in the step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is released, when the battery is turned on again, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>conducts again the operation button function setup conducting processing from step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and sets the function of the operation button. In this case, when the content of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is changed, the operation button is renewed to the new setting content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, a method by which each function is made to correspond (set) to each port corresponding to each operation button will be described. When the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is produced, the operation button/function correlation table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made, and stored. For example, a case where the operation button is arranged so that the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is easily used for the right-handed user, will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the arrangement state of a plurality of operation buttons provided on the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Herein, when the release button or zoom button is desired to arrange on the right side of the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), so that the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is easily used for the right-handed user, each function (function to conduct ON/OFF of the power source, function to turn ON the release switch) is allotted to a port (P<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) corresponding to each operation button by 1 to 1, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in the operation button/function correlation table, the correspondence of each port with each function is stored. Thereby, to the port P<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> corresponding to the button in the right upper portion of the drawing, the release function is set, and to the ports P<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> corresponding to the button in the right lower portion of the drawing, the tele zoom function and wide zoom function are set. As described above, because the buttons on the right side of the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be set to the buttons to control the functions of the release or zoom which are the functions whose frequency of use is high when the photographing is conducted, the digital camera which is easily used for the right-handed user, can be produced by forming or changing the operation button/function correlating table of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, in the same manner, when the operation button is arranged so that the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be easily used for the left-handed user, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), to each port corresponding to each operation button by 1 to 1, each function is allotted and the operation button&middot;function table is made. Thereby, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the release function, and zoom function whose frequency of use is high, are set to the left side buttons. As described above, because the buttons on the left side of the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be set to the buttons to control the functions of the release or zoom which is the function whose frequency of use is high when the photographing is conducted, the digital camera which is easily used for the left-handed user, can be produced when the operation button/function correlation table of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made or changed. As described above, the making or changing of the operation button/function correlation table of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is conducted in the production process, however, a structure that, after the user purchases the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the user itself changes the operation button/function correlation table of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, may also be adopted. For example, the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set to the setting mode, and in the display means provided in the digital camera, for example, a list of the function is displayed together with the arrangement view of the button, and the user can allot and set each function to each button. In this connection, in the same manner as the making or changing of the operation button/function correlation table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, it can be set when the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is made or changed in the production process, whether the switching of the power source ON/OFF of the digital camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is conducted by the operation of a predetermined operation button, or by, for example, the opening or closing of the slide type lens barrier B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As described above, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to the operation button/function correlation table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the time of turning-on of the battery, and by the function made correspondent to the operation button in the operation button/function correlation table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, it sets the function (control sequence) to be conducted when the operation button is operated. Further, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and when it is judged that &ldquo;0&rdquo; is stored, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>observes the operation signal inputted from the power button, and when the pressing signal is inputted and further the power button is released, the power source is turned ON, and the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>enters into the photographing ready state. In the photographing ready state, when the operation button is operated, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>conducts the function (control sequence) set to the operation button. In the photographing ready state, when the pressing signal is inputted from the power button, and further the power button is released, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>turns OFF the power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> On the one hand, when it is judged that &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored in the power flag storage section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>observes the condition detection SW which is switched by interlocking with the open and close condition of the slide type lens barrier B, and when the slide type lens barrier B is in the opened state and the condition detection SW is switched to ON, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>turns ON the power source, and enters into the photographing ready state. In the photographing ready state, when the operation button is operated, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>conducts the function (control sequence) set to the operation button. In the photographing ready state, when the slide type lens barrier B is in the closed state, and the condition detection Switch is turned OFF, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>turns OFF the power source. </paragraph>
