<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus. More specifically, the present invention relates to a bag manufacturing apparatus that packages articles that are dropped in batches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are many articles such as candies, fresh produce, and processed foods which are distributed and sold after being packaged, with each package having a predetermined weight or quantity. Generally, such articles are weighed by a weighing apparatus to obtain the predetermined weight of the article before a packaging apparatus packages the articles. A system that performs such weighing and packaging of the articles mainly includes a weighing apparatus, and a bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus. The weighing apparatus performs a combination weighing, by which a predetermined weight or quantity of the articles is obtained. The bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus manufactures bags from a film, and then packages the predetermined amount of articles that are weighed by the weighing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of an apparatus including the weighing, bag manufacturing and packaging system and the preceding and subsequent processes of such weighing, bag manufacturing and packaging system are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this case, articles are conveyed by a supply conveyor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a position above a weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Then, the articles are placed on dispersion feeders <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to be dispersed radially by vibration of the dispersion feeders <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The articles are then conveyed to a plurality of circumferentially disposed pool hoppers <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> via radial troughs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that continue from the dispersion feeders <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The articles are temporarily pooled in the pool hoppers <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and discharged into weighing hoppers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that are positioned below each of the pool hoppers <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The weights of the articles discharged into the weighing hoppers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are obtained by load cells (weight detectors) that are provided in each of the weighing hoppers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Then, a combination calculation is performed. The combination calculation outputs, based on the measured weights of articles in each of the weighing hoppers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a combination of weighing hoppers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> whose articles, once discharged, add up to a weight or quantity that is within a permitted range. Based on the result of the combination calculation, some of the weighing hoppers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> discharge the articles into collection discharge chutes <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that is positioned below the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is an apparatus that both manufactures bags, and then packages the articles discharged from the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the manufactured bags. A main structure of the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This is a structure of an apparatus known as a longitudinal pillow packaging apparatus. In this bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a sheet of a film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that is pulled from a film roll <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is shaped into a tubular shape by a tube <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and a former <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is conveyed downward by a pull down belt mechanism <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Overlapping longitudinal edges of the tubular film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are heat-sealed (sealed by heat) by a longitudinal seal mechanism <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Then, once the weighed articles are inserted into the tubular film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via the tube <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that is disposed below the tube <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> seals the upper portion of the bag and the bottom portion of the preceding bag in a transverse direction. At the same time, the center portion of the transversely sealed portion is cut with a cutter that is provided inside the transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Bags <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which have been filled with articles are placed on a conveyor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via an inclined guiding board <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. Then, the bags <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are conveyed to a weight checker <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a seal checker (not shown in figures) downstream thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus described above, it is important to keep articles from being caught in the sealing portion during the transverse sealing of the bags. If articles are caught in the sealing portion, the bag has to be discarded because it has been improperly sealed. Accordingly, production efficiency decreases. If there are too many occurrences of improper sealing, it may be necessary to stop the production line. Therefore, based on the number of occurrences of improper sealing and data provided by the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus, an operator will normally manually adjust the timing in which articles are discharged from the weighing unit, or the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 10-77002 discloses detecting means that detects the discharge (dropping) of the articles from the weighing unit in order to automatically adjust the transverse sealing operation. However, since the detecting means only detects the discharge of the articles, changes in the articles that occur after the articles are discharged cannot be reflected in the adjustments. Therefore, depending on the type of articles for which the bag manufacturing and packaging operation is performed, these adjustments may not work effectively. For instance, when the bag manufacturing and packaging is performed at a high speed on articles such as potato chips that are processed in batches, the gap between the batch of articles dropped first and the batch of articles dropped subsequently needs to be set such that the articles do not get caught during the transverse sealing. Occasionally, however, the articles become dispersed within each batch, and the gap between the batches of articles becomes too short during the sealing operation. This dispersion of articles occurs due to factors such as a change in temperature or a change in the thickness or size of the chips. When such dispersion of articles occurs, a seal check detector provided in a seal checker or the transverse seal mechanism could show deterioration in the rate of proper sealing. However, it is difficult to take appropriate measures unless the operator has a great deal of experience in dealing with this problem. In particular, it takes a certain amount of experience to determine whether the improper sealing is occurring because the timing at which the articles are dropped is not set properly, or because the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus is too short. Where the gap reaches the point where it is constantly short, the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus needs to be adjusted. Conventionally, however, only very experienced operators have been able to perform this type of adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, there exists a need for a bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to enable an operator to quickly take appropriate measures when articles are likely to be caught in the sealing portion. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus that automatically avoids situations in which the articles tend to get caught in the sealing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a first aspect of the invention is an apparatus for packaging batches of articles that are dropped. The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus includes detection means and comparison means. The detection means detects a bottom end and a top end of batches of articles being dropped. The comparison means obtains a gap distance based on the results detected by the detection means. The gap distance is a distance between the top end of a preceding batch and the bottom end of a subsequent batch. Then, the comparison means compares the gap distance obtained with a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Here, the detecting means detects the bottom end and the top end of the batches of the articles. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a gap distance between batches that are dropped intermittently. Upon obtaining the gap distance, the comparing means compares the gap distance with a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is possible to determine whether the batches of articles are likely to get caught in the packaging portion based on the result of the comparison. Accordingly, it is possible to issue a warning to the operator or perform a control to increase the gap distance when the articles are likely to get caught. Where a warning is issued to the operator, the operator can quickly become aware of the likelihood of any deficiency in the packaging and take appropriate measures. When the gap distance is increased, it is possible to prevent the articles from getting caught in the packaging portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As the detecting means, ones such as photoelectric sensors that detect passage of the batches of articles directly can be utilized. Vibration sensors, which are provided on a member that contacts the batches of articles and detect the top and bottom ends of the batches of articles indirectly can also be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a second aspect of the invention is the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to the first aspect, further comprising a controller. The controller issues a control signal to a processing device used in the preceding process based on the comparison results by the comparison means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Here, the controller that performs a control based on the comparison results from the comparison means. The controller issues a control signal to a processing device used in the preceding process relative to the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus. In this way, where the gap distances between the batches of articles reach the point where they are constantly short due to a change in surrounding environment such as temperature, or a change in the situation of the articles, it is possible to control the processing device used in the preceding process such as a weighing unit. Accordingly, it is possible to change the frequency with which the longitudinal bag manufacturing device receives the articles being supplied, which would otherwise not be changeable by simply controlling the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a third aspect of the invention is the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to the second aspect of the invention, wherein the controller issues a control signal to the processing device used in the preceding process in order to reduce the processing speed of the processing device when the gap distance is smaller than a predetermined minimum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the gap distance is shortened, there is an increase in the occurrence of improper bag manufacturing. Accordingly, the actual operation rate of the production line decreases. Therefore, a predetermined minimum value is established for the gap distance here. When the gap distance becomes shorter than the minimum value, a control signal is issued in order to decrease the processing speed of the preceding process. Due to the decrease in the processing speed of the preceding process, the number of bags being manufactured by the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus decreases. However, since the rate of occurrence of improper bag manufacturing decreases, the actual operation rate of the production line increases overall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a fourth aspect of the invention is the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to the third aspect of the invention, wherein the controller issues a control signal to the processing device used in the preceding process in order to increase the processing speed of the processing device, and to increase the processing speed of the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus when the gap distance is greater than a predetermined maximum value. When the gap distance is unnecessarily large, it is possible to increase the bag manufacturing speed of the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus, while maintaining a favorable rate of improper bag manufacturing that is caused by articles being caught. In view of this function, here, when the gap distance is greater than a predetermined maximum value, the processing speed of both the processing device used in the preceding process and the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus can be increased, such that the processing capacity can be increased as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a fifth aspect of the invention is an apparatus that is adapted to package articles by sealing top and bottom ends of a manufactured tubular bag while batches of the articles are dropped in the bag. The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus includes detection means and a controller. The detection means detects a discharge of the articles from a processing device used in a preceding process. The controller automatically adjusts the cycle time of a bag manufacturing and packaging operation based on the results detected by the detection means, such that the articles are not caught in the sealed portions of the bags. The cycle time is a predetermined period of time, between the time when one bag is manufactured and packaged and the time when the next bag is manufactured and packaged. In other words, the cycle time is a predetermined period of time that is necessary to manufacture and package one bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, minor adjustments in the bag manufacturing operation of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation, and adjustments to the timing in which articles are discharged from the processing device used in the preceding process, have been performed based on the detection of batches of articles being dropped. There has been, however, no control that takes into account the constant change in the shape of the batch of articles being dropped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus of this aspect of the present invention, the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation is adjusted automatically based on the results from the detection means, taking into consideration the constant change of the state of the dropped articles that occurs due to factors including a change in the state of the articles and a change in environmental factors such as temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the adjustment of the cycle time, which an operator has conventionally performed based on his experience by looking at the increase in the rate of improper packaging, can now be performed automatically and more properly. In this manner, it is possible to automatically prevent situations in which articles are caught in the sealing portion. Accordingly, the burden on the operator is reduced. In addition, since bag manufacturing and packaging defects decrease, the actual operation rate of the production line increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a sixth aspect of the invention is the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus of the fifth aspect, wherein the detection means detects the top and bottom ends of batches of articles being dropped. The controller obtains a gap distance based on the results detected by the detection means. The gap distance is a distance between the top end of a preceding batch and the bottom end of a subsequent batch. When the gap distance is determined to be too small, the controller lengthens the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation and issues a control signal to the processing device used in the preceding process in order to reduce the processing speed of the processing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Here, the focus is on the constant change in the gap distance between the batches of articles, which occurs because of constant change in the state of articles being dropped. The change in the gap distance occurs, even when the cycle time does not change, due to factors including a change in the articles and a change in environmental factors such as temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the gap distance between batches of articles, which has a great impact on whether the articles get caught in the bag manufacturing portion, is obtained from the result of detection from the detection means. When the gap distance is too small and the articles are likely to get caught, the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation is lengthened, and the processing speed of the processing device of the preceding process is decreased. In this manner, although the number of bags that are manufactured by the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus decreases, the ratio of improper bag manufacturing due to articles getting caught decreases. Accordingly, the actual operation rate of the production line increases overall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to a seventh aspect of the invention is the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus of the sixth aspect of the invention, wherein the controller shortens the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation and issues a control signal to the processing device of the preceding process in order to increase the processing speed of the processing device when the gap distance is determined to be too large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Here too, the focus is on the constant change in the gap distance between the batches of articles that occurs because of constant change in the state of articles being dropped. As described above, the change in the gap distance occurs even when the cycle time does not change due to factors including a change in the state of the articles and a change in environmental factors such as temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> More specifically, when the gap distance between batches of articles which is obtained by the detection means becomes too large, the processing speed of the processing device of the preceding process is increased, while shortening the cycle time. In this manner, the number of bags manufactured by the bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus per a given period of time is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus according to an eighth aspect of the invention is the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus of the fourth, sixth, or the seventh aspect of the invention, wherein the controller determines whether the gap distance is too large or too small by comparing a plurality of the gap distances with a predetermined minimum value or a predetermined maximum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In order to properly determine whether the gap distance between batches of articles is changing only temporarily or constantly, an appropriate lower limit or an upper limit to the gap distance is established. Here, whether the gap distance is too large or too small is determined based on comparison of several measurements of gap distance.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal seal mechanism <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a mechanism that presses the overlapping portions of the film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> wrapped around the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> against the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a predetermined pressure while heating the overlapping portions, thereby sealing the film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in a longitudinal direction. The longitudinal seal mechanism <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a heater and a heater belt that is heated by the heater, and contacts the overlapping portions of the film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is placed beneath the forming mechanism, the pull down belt mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the longitudinal seal mechanism <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a pair of seal jaws <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is symmetrical on the left and right sides. The two seal jaws <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>rotate in the shape of the letter D, drawing trajectories T that are symmetric relative to each other. The seal jaws <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are pressed against each other when the tubular film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is formed by the longitudinal sealing, is transversely sealed.

The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also controls the timing at which articles are discharged from the weighing unit or the article supplier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is a preceding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably includes a microcomputer with a control program that controls the bag manufacturing and packaging portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as discussed below. This controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a ROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a RAM <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and an input portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The ROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the RAM <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the display <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the input portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are operatively coupled to the CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The display <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the input portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are placed on the front side of the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled with the devices that it controls, including the pull down belt mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the longitudinal seal mechanism <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a driving device of the film supply unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>as well as the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the precise structure and algorithms for controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be any combination of hardware and software that will carry out the functions of the present invention. In other words, &ldquo;means plus function&rdquo; clauses as utilized in the specification and claims should include any structure or hardware and/or algorithm or software that can be utilized to carry out the function of the &ldquo;means plus function&rdquo; clause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are disposed above the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. More specifically, an transparent tubular member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed from an acrylic material is inserted between the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a discharge outlet of a collection discharge chute <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is disposed above the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The pair of photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which emits and receives light, is disposed so as to be able to monitor the articles passing through the tubular member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> constantly send to the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> a signal indicating whether or not the batch of potato chips, which is dropped form the collection discharge chute <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the tubular member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, is passing between the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">Overall Control </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment can manufacture and package twenty to two hundred bags or articles in one minute. The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> calculates the cycle time, which is the length of time necessary to manufacture one bag and package one bag of articles, based on the number of bags to be manufactured in a given period of time inputted for configuration. Then, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the speed with which the pull down belt mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> feeds the tubular film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>downward and the speed with which the seal jaws <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> rotate, such that these speeds correspond to the cycle time. In this manner, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> functions as an adjusting means. Based on the cycle time, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> sends to a controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> a request signal requesting a discharge of the articles. In other words, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also functions as a signal issuing means. Once the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives a request signal, the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> performs the weighing discharge operation, dropping a batch of potato chips to the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and returns a discharge completion signal to the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Automatic Adjustment Control of Dropping Timings </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> obtains from the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> data on the time at which the bottom end (first end) of the batch of potato chips passes the position of the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Based on this data, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> automatically adjusts the timing at which the batch of potato chips is dropped and the timing at which the seal jaws <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the transverse seal mechanism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> perform the transverse sealing. As is graphically depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> recognizes the timings at which the potato chips <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which are the bottom ends of the batches of potato chips <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, pass the height position of the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Automatic Adjustment Control of Cycle Time </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> here calculates a separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for adjustment of the cycle time, in order to prevent the potato chips from getting caught in the transverse sealing portion of the bag <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> gap distance (opening) in the vertical direction between the preceding batch of potato chips <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the subsequent batch of potato chips <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which are discharged from the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and fall on their weight. More specifically, the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the gap distance between the potato chip <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is at the top end of the first dropped batch of potato chips <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the potato chip <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is at the bottom end of the subsequently dropped batch of potato chips <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The vertical length of the batch of potato chips <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is a charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In a given cycle time, the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes shorter as the charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes longer. The charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> varies at each cycle. The charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can also vary due to changes in the surrounding environment or changes in the production process of the potato chips. For instance, when the temperature surrounding the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> goes up, the charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the batch of the potato chips tends to increase due to an increased dispersion of the potato chips. The charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can also change constantly due to changes in the size of the potatoes from which the potato chips are made, the thickness of the slices, or the seasonings applied to the surfaces of the potato chips. When the charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes due to such reasons, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes the frequency of discharges from the weighing unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by adjusting the cycle time, so as to optimize the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> calculates the charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on the results of detection by the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Then, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> compares the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the predetermined maximum value and the predetermined minimum value. In this manner, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> functions as comparison means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shorter than the predetermined minimum value, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes the configuration to make the cycle time longer, thereby reducing the processing capacity. At the same time, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> issues a request signal to the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the articles are discharged in accordance with the cycle time. Due to the longer cycle time, the frequency of the request signal to the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> requesting discharge of the articles decreases. In other words, as the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes the configuration to lengthen the cycle time, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is effectively sending a command to the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to reduce the processing speed of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (in other words, to reduce the number of batches of potato chips that are discharged in a given period of time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Where the average of several separating lengths L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is greater than the predetermined maximum value, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes the configuration to shorten the cycle time (for instance by increasing by 5 the number of bags to be manufactured and packaged in one minute). Accordingly, the processing speeds of the film supply unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and each of the mechanisms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> increase. Also, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> issues the request signal requesting the discharge of the articles to the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such that the articles are discharged in accordance with the cycle time. Due to the shortened cycle time, the frequency of the request signal to the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> requesting discharge of the articles increases. In other words, as the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes the configuration to shorten the cycle time, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is effectively sending a command to the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to increase the processing speed of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (in other words to increase the number of batches of potato chips that are discharged in a given period of time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The predetermined minimum value and the predetermined maximum value should be set low enough and high enough such that the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will not reach them due to variances in each cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> &lt;Features of the Longitudinal-Type Bag Manufacturing and Packaging Apparatus of the Present Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, minor adjustments to the bag manufacturing operation of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation, and adjustments to the discharge timing of the articles from the processing device used by the preceding process, have been performed based on the detection of batches of articles such as potato chips being dropped. There has been, however, no control that takes into account the constant change in the shape of the batch of articles being dropped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment detects the change in the state of the dropped articles as the change occurs due to changes in the state of the articles or changes in the surrounding environment such as temperature. Then, the cycle time of the bag manufacturing and packaging operation is automatically adjusted based on the result of the detection by the photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> calculates the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which has a great impact on whether the articles are likely to be caught in the transverse sealing portion. When the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is too small and the articles are very likely to get caught, the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> lengthens the cycle time and reduces the processing speed of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is the preceding process. In this manner, although the number of bags that are manufactured by the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a given period of time decreases, the ratio of improper bag manufacturing due to articles getting caught decreases. Accordingly, the actual operation rate of the production line increases overall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When the gap distance is unnecessarily large, on the other hand, it is possible to increase the speed of bag manufacturing of the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while maintaining the low rate of improper bag manufacturing from articles being caught. Similarly, when the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is too large, the cycle time is shortened and the processing speed of the weighing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is increased. Accordingly, the number of bags manufactured by the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a given period of time increases. In this manner, the overall processing capacity increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In this manner, in the longitudinal-type bag manufacturing and packaging apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, even when the charge length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> change due to a change in the state of the potato chips or a change in the surrounding environment such as temperature, the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is automatically adjusted in accordance with the change. Therefore, the articles are prevented from being caught in the transverse sealing portion, and the number of bags manufactured and packaged is optimized to the highest possible level. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, when the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes shorter than the predetermined minimum value, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes the configuration to lengthen the cycle time. However, in view of the variances in the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in each cycle, it is possible to set a condition such as that the separating length is shorter than the minimum value for several consecutive times, or that the average value of several recent measurements of separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shorter than the minimum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (B) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The above embodiment utilizes photoelectric sensors <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. However, it is also possible to fix a vibration sensor to the collection discharge chute <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> or the tubular member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, with which the batches of potato chips collide. In this case, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> detects the top and bottom ends of the batches of potato chips by analyzing the vibration waves sent from the vibration sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (C) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the cycle time is adjusted automatically by comparing the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the predetermined values. Alternatively, it is possible to adjust the cycle time automatically by establishing a parameter called separating time, which is a length of time between the time when the top end of the preceding batch passes and the time when the bottom end of the subsequent batch passes. Then, the separating time is compared with an upper limit time and a bottom limit time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (D) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the automatic adjustment to lengthen the cycle time is performed when the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shorter than the predetermined minimum value. It is also possible to only issue a warning to the operator, instead of performing such automatic adjustment. In other words, the controller functions as alert means. For instance, the time-series variances of the separating length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be displayed to the operator. Also, a screen that alerts the operator to the possibility of articles getting caught can be displayed. It is also possible to display a screen indicating a change in the configuration of the cycle time that needs to be made, thereby affirmatively urging the operator to take appropriate measures. In this manner, the operator can immediately recognize that improper packaging is occurring. Accordingly, even an inexperienced operator can take appropriate measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this invention, the gap distance between the batches of articles that are dropped intermittently is obtained, and the gap distance is compared with the predetermined values. Therefore, it is possible to determine, based on the result of the comparison, whether the articles are likely to get caught in the packaging portion. Accordingly, it is possible to issue a warning to the operator or perform a control to enlarge the gap distance when the articles are likely to get caught. Where a warning is issued to the operator, the operator can quickly become aware of the likelihood of the packaging deficiency and take an appropriate measure. Where the control to enlarge the gap distance is performed, it is possible to automatically prevent the articles from getting caught in the packaging portion. </paragraph>
