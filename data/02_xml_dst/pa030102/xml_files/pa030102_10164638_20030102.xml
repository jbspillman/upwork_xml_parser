<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a compressor with a build-in electric motor which is suitable to be mounted on a mobile structure such as a motor vehicle. The invention also relates to a mobile structure having such a compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a vehicle driven only by an engine, a compressor driven by the engine has been used for air-conditioning the vehicle compartment with the compressor being mounted alongside of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hybrid vehicles having both an engine and an electric motor and traveling by use of one of them according to conditions have been practically used for going on public roads. Air-conditioning of the vehicle compartment of this hybrid vehicle is made by a compressor driven by the engine in the same manner as conventional engine-driven vehicles, which compressor is mounted alongside of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is proposed that the engines of hybrid vehicles should be shut off while they are temporarily stationary at a place such as a traffic light in order to reduce effects of the engine upon the environment. When the proposal is followed with a vehicle where a compressor driven by the engine is used, air-conditioning stops each time when the vehicle stops, causing problem for the driver and passengers in the compartment in summer and winter seasons, and especially in regions with extremely cold or hot climate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For solving such-a problem, there is an idea of adopting a compressor to be driven by an electric motor, especially a compressor to be used for air-conditioning in a building as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The compressor with a built-in electric motor is housed in a container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> made of iron, together with a compression mechanism <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an electric motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In the hybrid vehicle, furthermore, the arrangement of devices in an engine room is based on that of the conventional motor vehicle. Thus, there is no space or location for installing the conventional compressor with the built-in electric motor for air-conditioning in the building in the engine room, so that the compressor should be mounted alongside the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Regarding such a problem, the present inventors have conducted various experiments and found the following facts. That is, there is an inconvenience that a mounting leg or mounting seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> made of a sheet-metal welded on the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> requires a seat on the engine side. In addition, the compressor is heavy as much as about 9 kg or more. As the compressor is mounted alongside the engine, the strength of the mounting seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is insufficient with respect to the weight of the compressor and vibrations thereof. In addition, the compressor is forced to receive vibrations of the engine, so that a weld zone between the conventional mounting seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be fractured, resulting in poor durability and lack of reliability. There is also an idea to prevent the influence of vibrations of the engine to the compressor and to the vehicle compartment by sandwiching an elastic member between the mounting seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the engine. However, the mounting position of the mounting seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the engine is greatly varied, so that the position on which the elastic member is to be mounted can be also varied. It results in the increase in the number of components and also the increase in the number of fabrication steps, causing the increase in costs. Furthermore, the elastic member arranged on each of the mounting parts exerts its ability of impact absorption on a restricted area on the mounted part, resulting in poor vibration control. If the vibration control is compensated using any member having a small spring constant, the elastic member tends to be broken between the vibrating engine and the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the conventional compressor with the built-in electric motor has large axial dimensions. For example, the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> extends to approximately 250 mm. That is, a discharge port <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a suction port <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, inner and outer electric connection parts <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the mounting legs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are longitudinally extended from both ends of the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In addition, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is supported by main- and sub-bearing members <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> independently installed in the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> together with the both ends of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> connected to the electric motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In addition, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> actuates a pump <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for oil supply being provided independently from the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the side of the sub-shaft bearing member <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Such a complicated construction of the compressor is hardly incorporated in an electric-powered vehicle which-has been only realized in a small-sized vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Simultaneously, the conventional compressor with the built-in electric motor is made of iron, so that the total weight thereof is about 9 kg or more. Thus, it becomes a problem in realizing the high speed and the energy saving because of the increase in driving load when it is mounted on the mobile structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is provided a compressor with a built-in electric motor in which a container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is made of an aluminum material to reduce the weight of the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this case, however, the principle configuration of the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as that of the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> made of iron except that the axial length of the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is approximately 220 mm which is slightly smaller than that of the container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In addition, just as in the case with-one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is constructed of three container members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>by which two independent connection portions <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are formed on the body. Those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are made of iron and are mutually connected to each other by welding under favor of being designed as maintenance-free without overhaul. However, the container members made of aluminum as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are not suitable for welding, so that they are connected to each other by means of bolt connection. The wall of the aluminum container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the thickness directions is greater than that of the iron container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to satisfy the conditions of a pressure container. For the connection with bolts <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a pair of flange portions <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in each of the two connection portions <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is required. Here, the flange portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is protruded outwardly from the periphery of the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the radial direction. In addition, the flange portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> continuously or discontinuously extends around the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction. In each connection portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a lot of bolts <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, for example eight bolts <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, may be used so that the total weight of the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is approximately 8 to 9 kg. It means that the substantial reduction in the weight of the container <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is not achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It becomes urgent business to provide a small-sized and lightweight compressor with a built-in electric motor now in a tendency of planning an electric operation of various kinds of load by using a working voltage of 42 volts in a gasoline-powered vehicle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric-powered vehicle. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a small-sized and light-weighted compressor with a built-in electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, a first aspect of the invention is to provide a compressor with a built-in electric motor, where a compression mechanism and a built-in electric motor for driving the mechanism are housed in a container. In the container, a suction port, a discharge port, inner and outer electric connection parts, and mounting legs are provided on the same side of a body of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the above configuration, the entire size of the compressor in the axial direction is reduced till it becomes almost equal to the size of the container in the axial direction. In addition, such a concentrated arrangement of structural components on the predetermined area of the container prevents them from taking up much space, compared with the arrangement of structural components dispersed around the container. As the suction port, the discharge port, the electric connection parts, and the mounting legs are arranged in a restricted area so as to be close to each other to share a part of or the whole of the wall of the container in the thickness direction. Thus, the section of the container on which each of them dominantly arranged is reduced. In addition, since the suction port and the discharge port are positioned on the body of the container, a margin for connection of an external pipe is obtained on the internal diameter side by utilizing the fact that each of the outer and inner peripheries of the end of the container tends to become a dead space. The wall of the container in the thickness direction is shared much more, compared with the case of outwardly extending from the container, so that the reduction in size and weight of the container is achieved. The bulk of the container is further reduced as much as the extent of both the suction port and the discharge port which do not protrude out of the container. Consequently, the compressor with the built-in electric motor is made compact and light weight in addition to allow the reduction in cost. Thus, the compressor is easily mounted on the mobile structure such as an automobile and contributes to energy saving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the invention is to provide a compressor with a built-in electric motor, where a compression mechanism and a built-in electric motor for driving the mechanism are housed in a container, including: a bearing part for supporting an end of a driving shaft for driving the compression mechanism, the bearing part which is formed on an end wall integral to a body of the container, where the end of the driving shaft to be supported by the bearing part is located in the direction opposite to the compression mechanism and the driving shaft is connected to the built-in electric motor; a pumping mechanism provided in a pumping chamber opened to an external surface of the end wall, which is connected to the end of the driving shaft in the direction opposite to the compression mechanism; and a closing member that closes the opening of the pumping chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In such a configuration, the bearing part of the driving shaft on the side of the pump mechanism and the pump mechanism portion are assembled and concentrated in the end wall of the container. Such a concentrated arrangement prevents them from taking up much space, compared with the arrangement of structural components dispersed around the container. In other words, they are arranged in a restricted area so as to be close to each other to share a part of or the whole of the wall of the container in the thickness direction. In addition, they share a part of or the whole of a space in the container in the axial direction, so that the specific section and the specific space in the container are reduced. Thus, the size of the container is reduced in the axial direction. Furthermore, reduction in weight of the whole is achieved as much as reducing the specific section of the container and the axial size of the container. Consequently, the compressor with the built-in electric motor is made compact and light weight in addition to the reduction in cost. The compressor is thus easily mounted on the mobile structure such as an automobile and contributes to energy saving. Furthermore, since a positioning of the bearing and the container becomes unnecessary by integrating the bearing part of the driving shaft into the end wall of the container, the positioning accuracy is increased while an assembling operation becomes ease, thereby reducing the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> While novel features of the invention are set forth in the preceding, the invention, both as to organization and content, can be further understood and appreciated, along with other objects and features thereof, from the following detailed description and examples when taken in conjunction with the attached drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a compressor with a built-in electric motor as one of preferred embodiments of the present invention and a mobile structure having such a compressor will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings for facilitating the understanding of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the compressor is a scroll type compressor with a built-in electric motor to be mounted on an engine of a hybrid vehicle in a horizontal position. However, the invention is not limited to such a type of compressor. The present invention is also applicable to any compressor for air-conditioning of the interior of a room in addition to the vehicle compartment of a typical mobile structure such as a motor vehicle, exerting the advantages of weight reduction and miniaturization. According to the invention, various kinds of compression mechanisms, for example rotary and reciprocation type compression mechanisms, may be used. Furthermore, any vertical type compressor may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> hybrid vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> includes a gasoline-powered engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be driven by the supply of power from a battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a rechargeable battery. While the vehicle runs using the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged. While the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a sufficient charged capacity, the motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is controlled to receive the supply of power for driving the vehicle with the motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to restrict the discharge of exhaust gas to a minimum. When the vehicle is running with the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is controlled such that the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped while the vehicle is temporally stopped, for example at a traffic light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> driven by a built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is used for an air-conditioning of the vehicle compartment of the hybrid vehicle. The compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constructed to keep the air-conditioning of the vehicle compartment even though the vehicle running with the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is temporally stopped at a traffic light or the like and the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> scroll type compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to drive the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are housed in a container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to constitute the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is operated by the supply of power through a terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided as inner and outer electric connection parts of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to actuate the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inspires a refrigerant after passing through a refrigeration cycle via a suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to compress the refrigerant. Then, the compressed refrigerant is discharged into the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to cool the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, followed by discharging the refrigerant into an external pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outside the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to supply the refrigerant to the refrigeration cycle for air-conditioning. Subsequently, these steps are repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being stored. The oil is inhaled by a pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> driven by the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The oil is then supplied to a main bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a main axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the side of the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a bearing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a coupling portion between the main axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a sliding portion of the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to make smooth. After lubricating the bearings and the sliding portion, the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> seeps through each lubricating object by means of a supply pressure and then returns to the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, followed by repeating such a lubricating process. By means of the action of a compatibility, a part of the refrigerant to be discharged into the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> brings the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> stored in an oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a part such as a sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which cannot be supplied with oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, lubricating the sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or the like. The sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is responsible for bearing a sub-axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the side of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opposite to the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the built-in electric motor of the present embodiment satisfies the requirements for maintenance free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the compressor of the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided as inner and outer electric connection parts, and mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided on the same side of a body of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In other words, the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are concentrated on the same side of the body of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Because they are not axially protruded out of the end of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the size of the entire compressor in the axial direction is reduced till it becomes almost equal to the size of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the axial direction. In addition, such a concentrated arrangement of structural components on the predetermined area of the container prevents them from taking up much space, so that it is more preferable than the arrangement of structural components dispersed around the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In other words, as the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are arranged in a restricted area so as to be close to each other to share a part of or the whole of the wall of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction. Thus, the section of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on which each of them dominantly arranged is reduced. In addition, since the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are positioned on the body of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a margin S for connection of an external pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is obtained on the internal diameter side as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, by utilizing the fact that each of the outer and inner peripheries of the end of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> tends to become a dead space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The wall of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction is shared much more, compared with the case of outwardly extending from the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the reduction in size and weight of the container is achieved. The bulk of the container is further reduced as much as the extent of both the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which do not protrude out of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the built-in electric motor is made compact and light weight in addition to the reduction in cost. The compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is thus easily mounted on the mobile structure such as a vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and contributes to energy saving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, each of the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are axially arranged on the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the concentration of these structural components around the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is increased, and it becomes more advantageous in the miniaturization and weight-saving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, one of the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are paired, while another one of the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the discharge part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are paired. Then, these pairs are positioned on the opposite sides of the body of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction, respectively. In addition, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located between these pairs. Thereby, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which tends to protrude outward is placed on an intermediate position between the above pairs, so that the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is placed in a dead space <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which exists in a wide variety of forms between the mounting portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> respectively including two mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Thus, the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> does not interfere with others even though it is arranged in the narrow cabinet of the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, so that a wiring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be connected from the outside and its wiring connection is protected from an undesired external force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are located on the outermost portion of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e., the opposite ends of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With this constitution, the external pipes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the refrigerating cycle are easily connected and disconnected outside the two mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on both sides of the connector <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> without being obstructed by the external wirings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the two mount portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of aluminum, so that it is advantageous to weight saving. In addition, such an aluminum container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be easily molded into a desired shape, so that a cylindrically protruded connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for mounting the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and so on are integrally molded on the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is advantageous to weight saving since there is no need to perform any additional work that takes a lot of trouble, such as post-mounting of each mounting leg and there is no factors that increase the weight of the resulting container, such as welding or bolt connection to be retrofitted. Furthermore, it is easy to work around a poor strength to be caused by retrofitting or the like even though the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are provided for direct connection to the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as in the present embodiment. The mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be provided as specific mounting legs suitable for direct connection to the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in the figures, the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a pair of the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and another pair of mounting legs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are positioned on opposite sides of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with respect to a diameter thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of aluminum, the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be integrally molded with the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with a simple structure without increasing its manufacturing cost, allowing an advantage of achieving a sufficient strength of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a low cost. Thus, it is suitable for the usage such as direct connection to the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in which the mounting strength is one of the important factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are provided on the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that they are symmetrical with respect to a direction perpendicular to an axial line of the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In addition, these legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are slightly projected from the periphery of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that they are almost symmetrical with respect to the center of gravity (G) of the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. According to the present invention, however, the concrete configuration of these mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not limited to a specific one. The connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is positioned to a coil end <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side so as to make easy the connection between the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a connection terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the coil end <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>For providing the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> formed in the body of the aluminum container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a sealing between the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is performed by means of conventional glass sealant. A connection plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>made of iron in the terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> cannot be welded to the connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> made of aluminum, so that the connection plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is used after being deformed into a flat shape. The terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is mounted on the connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> so as to satisfy the functions of pressure-proof and waterproof by placing the outer periphery of the iron connection plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on a step portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the middle of the inner periphery of the connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> via a seal member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and by sandwiching the connection plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the step portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a ring nut <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> screwed from the opening end of the connection opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The seal member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is attached in the inside of a groove of the step portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has an inner connection terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the inside of the connection plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an outer connection terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the outside thereof. The number of terminals can be varied depending on the type of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the system of control. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the terminals include three power-supply terminals as the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a three-phase motor and two signal terminals for a sensor of detecting the temperature of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the built-in electric motor of the present example, as shown In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> sub-bearing part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that supports a sub-axial portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed on the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> integral with the body of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Also, the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is provided as a pump mechanism in a pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> opened in the outer surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the end wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is then connected to the sub-axial portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, followed by closing the opening <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by means of a closing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the sub-bearing part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are assembled and concentrated in the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Here, the sub-bearing part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is on the side of the sub-axial portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that actuates the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, while the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> includes the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As a result, the bulk is prevented, compared with the bulk to be caused by distributing them around the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In other words, they are arranged in a restricted area so as to be close to each other to share a part of or the whole of the wall of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction. In addition, they share a part of or the whole of a space in the container in the axial direction, so that the specific section and the specific space in the container are reduced, respectively. Thus, the size of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is reduced in the axial direction. Furthermore, the reduction in weight of the whole is achieved as much as reducing the specific section of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the axial size of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the built-in electric motor becomes compact in size and light weight, so that the decrease in cost is achieved. Furthermore, the compressor is easily mounted on the mobile structure such as a vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, contributing to the energy saving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a positioning of the sub-bearing part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and sub-bearing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes unnecessary by integrating the sub-bearing part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the driving-shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the positioning accuracy is increased while an assembling operation becomes ease, so that the cost is reduced accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is opened to the external surface of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is easy to post-fitting the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from the outside to connect to the sub-axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be supported on the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> even though the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is integrally formed in the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition, after the connection, the opening may be closed by the closing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, so that the assembling operation is not complicated and does not take much time. Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be designed so as to be divided into a body part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a portion of the body. In this case, the divided portions are assembled together at a later time. Thus, the number of flanges <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that are integrally molded for connection and the number of bolts <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for joining the flanges <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are reduced to further reduction in size and weight. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there are four bolts <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> used. Each of a pair of the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a pair of the mounting legs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which are arranged in the axial direction of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, does not stand on both sides of the boundary of the separated portions (i.e., the connected portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These pairs are positioned on only one side of the boundary of the separated portions. In the figure, for example, they are arranged and concentrated-on the container main body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thus, the load at the time of supporting the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the engine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the like using the mounting legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not extend to the connection portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> between the body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the separated container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is advantageous that there is no need to consider the load when the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fixed and supported on the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by means of connection using bots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the connection portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The strength of connection between the container main body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may only consider the pressure-proof to a refrigerant. A seal member <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is provided on the connection portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and is then attached in the groove of the side of the lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is integrally formed as a circular recessed portion extending to the inside directly from the opening <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the external surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>.

There is no need to provide any element which tends to cause the fabrication of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> difficult or to cause the increase in weight and size of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is an oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> formed in the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> communicates to the oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed such that it shares the wall of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction with other structural components. The oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is thus formed to allow the tip <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to reach the bottom of the oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to draw the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>.

According to such a configuration of the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, it is possible to make the passage portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to the proximity of the bottom of the oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by perforating from the outside through the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that allows the communication between the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed without difficulty by perforating from the bottom of the oil storage portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the passage portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Here, when the closing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is located on a fixed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the communication between the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is blocked while allowing the communication between the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Concretely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, the plug portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the closing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided as a hollow portion, so that the wide space of the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is obtained. Utilizing such a structural advantage, a communication pore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that communicates to the passage portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed only on a circumferential point on the peripheral wall of the plug portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to allow the communication between the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, as the passage portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is perforated, an opening of an upper loophole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> or the like formed in the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is closed by fitting the peripheral wall of the plug portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the inner periphery of the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. A sealed portion by the sealing member <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is located close to the external surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, compared with the positions of the communication pore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and loophole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Thus, even though the loophole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> communicating to the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the inside of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed in the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by means of the perforation through the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the closing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fixed on a predetermined position to close the loophole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is only communicated with the oil passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> without the addition of any particular structural component or any operation for closing the loophole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has an oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. That is, the oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is attached on the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> such that the outer periphery of the oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the plug portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the closing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the back wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>together with the lid plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is allowed to cover an extended area around the small suction port <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pump <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> through the use of the space of the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Compared with the configuration of the conventional compressor in which the oil filter is provided on the suction port of a narrow oil passage, the oil-passing area of the oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is increased through the use of the pump chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> having a wide space. In other words, the oil-passing resistance of the oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is minimized. In addition, the life of such an oil filter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is prevented from being shortened, so that the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is stably supplied for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is an inner opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed in the inner surface of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition, means for separating the oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by blocking the inflow of a refrigerant, such as a plate-like oil separator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, is provided in the inner opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while leaving a gap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for introducing the refrigerant into the inside of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As shown in the figure, the oil separator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is fixed on a mounting surface <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> by means of a bolt <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The mounting surface <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is inwardly protruded from the inner opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to some extent. The oil separator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is mounted without requiring an additional space such that it is placed on the position close to the inner opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed by sharing the wall of the end wall <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction. Accordingly, the oil separator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is capable of blocking the direct inflow of the refrigerant toward the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> while allowing the separation of the oil components accompanied with the refrigerant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the above connection portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged on a position located between the built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the body of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is constructed of two body portions, a stator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be fixed on one of the container main body portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by means of bolt connection, thermal insert, welding, or the like. In this case, there is no trouble in the work for assembling the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fabrication of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is completed by connecting the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the main axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, followed by connecting to the remained lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>As a whole, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is easily fabricated, compared with the conventional one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the other of the container main body portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight>more specifically, there is a housing space for fixing a main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for supporting the main bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of bolt connection, thermal insert, welding, or the like as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the bearings on the opposite ends of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are easily and precisely aligned with reference to one of the container main body portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Subsequently, the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in place on the driving side which has been previously positioned and fixed in place by means of bolts <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or the like. Then, the remained lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using bolts <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the fabrication of the compressor is more facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in the figures is a scroll type one and is constructed of a fixed scroll <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> secured on the main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> by means of bolt connection and a swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having spiral wings being interlocked with each other, where the swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the fixed scroll <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled before assembling the main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> into the container main portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Furthermore, the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on the lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>together with the main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> by means of bolt connection or the like. Subsequently, the resulting integrated components are installed in the container main body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The main axial part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has an eccentric shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for driving the scroll-type compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The eccentric shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is designed to fit to the swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> through the bearing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, the eccentric shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>imparts a swing motion to the swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> along a predetermined circular orbit by the rotation of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For preventing an undesired rotation of itself at the time of swing motion, a rotation-preventing mechanism <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is provided between the main bearing member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> starts its swing motion, a compression chamber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> between the fixed scroll <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the swing scroll <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> moves from the outer peripheral portion to the center portion while reducing its volume to compress the refrigerant being introduced from the suction port <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in the outer peripheral portion. As the refrigerant being compressed reaches to a predetermined pressure, the compressed refrigerant is discharged in the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the discharge port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the center portion through a lead valve <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed such that it shares the wall of another end wall <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction formed by the lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In other words, the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed so as to extend through the inner dead space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the outer peripheral portion of the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the suction port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the inside of the end wall <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is positioned such that it is directly communicated with the suction port <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the suction passage <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the refrigerant and the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> are coexisted without requiring a specific structural component in an area between the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lid portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The refrigerant is discharged into the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Then, the refrigerant reaches to the side of the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a passage <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> formed between the compression mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the main axial member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> or between the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and each of them. Then, the electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is cooled by the refrigerator. After the cooling, the refrigerator reaches to the discharge port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> From the above description, the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in each of the cases described above is appropriately applied for a mobile structure to be used together with the battery to be moved. In addition, it is also appropriately applied for constructing a mobile structure such as a vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on which the compressor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the built-in electric motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mounted together with the battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may not be limited to a specific one such as a gasoline-powered vehicle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric-powered vehicle. The present invention can be applied on various kinds of the mobile structures including special-purpose vehicles and working-purpose vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to the first aspect of the invention, the size of the whole compressor in the axial direction is reduced till it becomes almost equal to the size of the container in the axial direction. In addition, such a concentrated arrangement of structural components on the predetermined area of the container prevents them from taking up much space, compared with the arrangement of structural components dispersed around the container. As a whole, the compressor is made compact and lightweight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to the second aspect of the invention, the bearing portion on the driving side of the pump mechanism by the driving shaft of the compressor and the pump mechanism portion are assembled and concentrated in the end wall of the container. Such a concentrated arrangement prevents them from taking up much space, compared with the arrangement of structural components dispersed around the container. In other words, they are arranged in a restricted area so as to be close to each other to share a part of or the whole of the wall of the container in the thickness direction. In addition, they share a part of or the whole of a space in the container in the axial direction, so that the specific section and the specific space in the container are reduced, respectively. Thus, the size of the container is reduced in the axial direction. Furthermore, the reduction in weight of the whole is achieved in the axial direction as much as reducing the specific section of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom. </paragraph>
