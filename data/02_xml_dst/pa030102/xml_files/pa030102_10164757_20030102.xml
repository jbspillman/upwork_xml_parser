<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to vacuum pumps of the regenerative type or which incorporate a regenerative section and which incorporate a high speed rotatable vertical shaft supported by bearings at each end of the shaft and in particular to lubricating systems for such bearings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In vacuum pumps of the regenerative type a rotor is mounted on a vertical shaft for rotation within a surrounding stator. The shaft is supported by upper and lower bearings which require lubrication. To facilitate lubrication of the upper bearing the shaft has a central axial bore and communicating radial holes in alignment with the upper bearing for delivering lubricating fluid to the bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A problem associated with lubricating the upper bearing is that for priming the lubricating fluid circuit quickly when the pump is started requires the presence of a relatively large volume of lubricating fluid accessible to the shaft. However, if the large volume of lubricating fluid remains in contact with the shaft when the shaft is rotating at normal working speeds the fluid will produce a drag effect and deliver an excessive quantity of oil to the bearings once the circuit is primed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an aim of this invention to provide a lubricating system for a vacuum pump of the regenerative type or incorporating a regenerative section in which the volume of lubricating fluid in contact with the shaft is metered to provide a set quantity for priming when the shaft starts rotating but thereafter meters the delivery of oil to the bearing in a way which is not dependent upon the rotary speed of the shaft.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which illustrates a known compound vacuum pump comprising a regenerative section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a molecular drag (Holweck) section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pump includes a casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made from a number of different body parts bolted or otherwise fixed together and provided with relevant seals therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Mounted within the casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a vertical shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> supported by an upper bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a lower bearing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is rotatable about its longitudinal axis and is driven by an electric motor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> surrounding the shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Securely attached to the shaft for rotation therewith is a rotor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. An axial bore <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> extends along a substantial length of the shaft and communicates with radial oil holes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; for delivering lubricating fluid from a shaft fluid lubricant reservoir to the upper bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> which illustrate the lower end of a vacuum pump of the regenerative type which incorporates the lubrication system of the present invention. As shown, a casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defines with a base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a cover plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Within the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and supported by the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a shaft lubricating fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Lubricating fluid, for example oil, contained within the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enters the shaft reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a controlled manner via ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the shaft reservoir wall as will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A vertical shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forming part of a vacuum pump of the regenerative type is mounted in upper bearing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and lower bearing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is generally cylindrical and has formed therein an axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> open at its lower end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in the shaft reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> communicates at its upper end with radial oil holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in alignment with the upper bearing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An axial impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located in the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> immediately below the upper bearing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and consists of an impeller thread <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed on the outer surface of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a static counter-face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> depending from the outer race of the bearing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The axial impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, inlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and oil holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> define a lubricating fluid delivery circuit as will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is stationary then the levels of lubricating fluid in the shaft lubricating fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be the same as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This means that a relatively large quantity of lubricating fluid will be in contact with the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> both externally of the shaft and within the axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This situation allows for a quick priming of the lubricating fluid circuit when the vacuum pump is started and the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> commences to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> When the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> reaches normal working speed then the lubricating fluid in the shaft reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be drawn from the reservoir through the open lower end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by centrifugal force. The fluid will travel axially up the axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> towards the oil holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as a thin film. Subsequently, the fluid will lubricate the upper bearing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and then be forced by means of the axial impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> back down in to the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the lubricating fluid feed to the axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is regulated to a level below that which the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can pump thereby removing the variants in oil quantity delivered to the bearing as a function of shaft speed. To control the delivery of fluid to the shaft reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> there are carefully calibrated fluid ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. These ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provide a fluid flow rate in to the shaft reservoir <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> dependent upon the head of fluid in the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> above the ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are specifically designed to be above the steady state height of the shaft reservoir fluid level to avoid back pressure. These ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are designed to ensure that the range of maximum expected oil levels correlates to a range of acceptable fluid delivery rates for the bearing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It will be evident that a regenerative pump must operate over a wide range of operational frequencies. The effect this has on fluid pumping speed is not manageable since slow frequencies may starve the bearing of lubrication whilst high frequencies may flood the bearings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The fluid ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are located at a height which allows for debris to fall below them whilst still within the sump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby avoiding delivery to the shaft reservoir <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The fluid in the sump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not subject to turbulence and should collect any such particulates without blocking the fluid ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this shows a modification to the lubricating system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> in that a filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located at the lower end of the axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. When the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotating the centrifugal force generated is utilised to drive the lubricating fluid through the filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on to the walls of the axial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
