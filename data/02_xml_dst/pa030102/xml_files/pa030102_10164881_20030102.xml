<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to fuel shut-off valves for engines, and, more particularly, to an automatic fuel pump outlet shut-off valve for diesel engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Engines are typically connected to a fuel storage tank via a fluid system including a fuel pump for conveying fuel from the tank to the engine. In a fluid system such as that typically located in a vehicle, a filter is disposed in the fuel line extending between the fuel tank and the engine at a location upstream from the engine. The filter functions to remove contaminants from the fuel which can cause damage to the internal components of the engine. Over time, a fuel filter can become obstructed and cause substandard vehicle operation, thereby making servicing of the fuel filter a priority. When this occurs, the vehicle operator may be tempted to remove the fuel filter to increase vehicle performance. If the fuel filter is removed, contaminants located within the fuel are not removed and are allowed to circulate through the vehicle&apos;s engine. The free flow of contaminants through the engine can cause problems including collection of particles within the valves of the engine, clogging of fuel injector jets, or scoring of the internal surfaces of the engine. Furthermore, if the vehicle has been operated with the fuel filter removed, service providers may be reluctant to honor warranties for damaged parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the vehicle operator may choose to service or replace the fuel filter. To perform service or replacement of the filter, the filter lid must be removed. When the filter lid is removed, a potential hazard exists for spraying fuel on to a service person and engine if the ignition is inadvertently turned to the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position, thereby energizing the fuel pump. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an automatic pump outlet shut-off valve. The shut-off valve is illustrated for use in a diesel engine, but may also be used in other engine types. The shut-off valve prevents operation of the engine if a fuel filter is not present. Additionally, the disclosed valve permits engine operation only after the filter lid is tightened and properly positions the filter within the filter cavity. The disclosed valve also prevents the discharge of fuel from the fuel pump when the filter lid is removed to replace or service the fuel filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention, in one form thereof, comprises a fuel filtering system for use in a fuel line extending between a fuel source and an engine which includes a fuel pump operably disposed in the fuel line between the fuel source and the engine and a valve member operably disposed in the fuel line between said fuel pump and the engine. The valve member has an open position and a closed position wherein the valve member permits passage of fuel through the fuel line when in the open position and prevents the passage of fuel through the fuel line when in the closed position. A biasing member engaged with the valve member biases the valve member towards the closed position. A fuel filter is mountable in the fuel filtering system and has a filter structure and a filter element extending from the filter structure. The filter element defines an interior volume and the fuel pump is at least partially disposed within the interior volume of the filter element. An actuating surface is located on the valve member and is engageable to bias the valve member towards its open position. Mounting the fuel filter to the fuel line engages the fuel filter with the actuating surface and thereby moves the valve member into the open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The fuel filtering system described above, may also include a housing defining a filter cavity with the fuel filter being positionable within the filter cavity. A removably attachable lid provides access to the filter cavity and also secures the fuel filter within the cavity. At least a portion of the fuel pump and the valve member are disposed within the housing and are positioned so that the valve member prevents the entry of fuel into the filter cavity when the valve member is in the closed position. The lid may also be configured whereby attachment of the lid to the housing biases a fuel filter located within the filter cavity into engagement with the actuating surface and thereby moves the valve member into the open position and wherein the lid is spaced from the actuating surface when the lid is attached to the housing and the valve is in the closed position whereby the valve member remains in the closed position when the lid is attached to the housing in the absence of the fuel filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention, in another form thereof, comprises a fuel filtering system for use in a fuel line extending between a fuel source and an engine. The system includes a filter housing defining a filter cavity wherein the filter cavity defines a portion of the fuel line. A fuel pump is operably disposed in the fuel line between the fuel source and the engine and is at least partially disposed within the housing. A valve mechanism having a body defining a valve opening and a valve member operably disposed within said valve opening defines a second portion of the fuel line and is disposed in the fuel line between the fuel pump and the filter cavity. The valve member has an open position and a closed position wherein the valve member permits passage of fuel through the fuel line when in the open position and prevents passage of fuel through the fuel line when in the closed position. A biasing member is engaged with the valve member and biases the valve member towards the closed position. A fuel filter is mountable within the filter cavity and has a filter structure and a filter element extending from the filter structure. The filter element defines an interior volume and the fuel pump is at least partially disposed within said interior volume. An actuating surface is located on the valve member and is engageable to bias the valve member towards the open position. Mounting the fuel filter within the filter cavity engages the filter structure with the actuating surface and moves the valve member into the open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The above described fuel filtering system may have a filter structure which sealingly engages the valve body proximate the valve opening and defines at least one passage proximate the valve opening. Fuel flowing through the valve opening towards the engine is thereby inhibited from directly entering the interior volume of the fuel filter by the sealing engagement of the filter structure with the valve body and is communicated to the filter cavity through the at least one passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The fuel filtering system may also include a lid removably attachable to the housing, removal of the lid providing access to the filter cavity and attachment of the lid securing the fuel filter within the filter cavity. The lid may also be configured whereby attachment of the lid to the housing biases a fuel filter located within the filter cavity into engagement with the actuating surface and thereby moves the valve member into the open position and wherein the lid is spaced from the actuating surface when the lid is attached to the housing and the valve is in the closed position whereby the valve member remains in the closed position when the lid is attached to the housing in the absence of the fuel filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The valve body of such fuel filtering systems may be disposed on the fuel pump with the valve opening defining the fuel pump outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The valve member of such fuel filtering systems may also include a first major surface wherein when the valve member is in the closed position the first major surface is positioned so that impingement of fuel in the fuel line on the valve member biases the valve member towards the closed position </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that it provides a simple, low cost, and effective fuel shut-off valve for a fuel filter and fuel pump combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a fuel shut-off valve which prevents the engine from starting if a fuel filter is not installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a shut-off valve which, when the filter lid is removed, automatically prevents the discharge of fuel from the fuel pump to prevent the spraying of fuel into the surrounding environment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown fuel filtering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in normal operation with fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in position. During normal operation, filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> surrounds and encloses fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removably attached to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. When filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is threadingly secured to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, projection <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the interior of filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and biases filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> towards fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> engages actuating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> located on valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to thereby bias valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into its open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The operation of valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. A biasing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which in the illustrated embodiment is a spring, biases valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> toward a closed position. In the absence of other forces, biasing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> maintains valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in its closed position wherein valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in sealing engagement with valve seat <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Mounting fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within fuel filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> results in the biasing engagement of filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with actuating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and thereby biases valve member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> out of engagement with valve seat <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into an open position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the illustrated embodiment, as lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is secured to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> biases fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into engagement with actuating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also engages fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with projections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> located on the lower surface of lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Projections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> engage filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> proximate the location where filter element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends therefrom. Alternative configurations of lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may also be used whereby the mounting of fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within fuel filtering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> results in the biasing engagement of actuating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the opening of valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also includes a first major surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is positioned, when valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the closed position, so that impingement of the fuel in the fuel line on valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, i.e., impingement of the fuel within fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, biases valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> towards its closed position. Since first major surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> forms a substantial majority of the surface area of valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is exposed to fluid pressure when valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the closed position, activation of fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the closed position will not overcome the biasing forces of biasing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and move valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into its open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a valve body <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> through which valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends. Valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is operably disposed in cylindrically shaped valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Valve seat <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is located at one end of valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is sealingly engageable with valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Valve body <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is located on the discharge end of fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and valve seat <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> defines the fuel pump outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In operation, fuel enters via fuel entry line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from a fuel tank (not shown) and proceeds into fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Fuel exits pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via fuel pump outlet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and continues through valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which thereby forms a portion of the fuel line. Fuel moves through passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in fuel structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and enters filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. After being filtered by filter element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, fuel enters the interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defined by fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> all have a generally cylindrical shape. Fuel flows from interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in inner housing wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and exits fuel filtering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via fuel exit line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Fuel exit line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> conveys the fuel to an engine (not shown). The general path of fuel flow can be seen as referenced by fuel flow direction arrows <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As shown by arrows <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> fuel flows through fuel entry line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, passages <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and fuel exit line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in that order and all of these items form a portion of the fuel line which extends from a fuel source such as a fuel tank (not shown) to an engine (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed from housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> automatically closes, as discussed in greater detail below, thereby preventing the potential spraying fuel through pump outlet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Such spraying is undesirable since it could allow fuel to be sprayed onto a service person or hot engine if the ignition key is inadvertently turned to the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position while the filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> sealingly engages valve body <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> proximate valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> whereby fluid flowing in the fuel line towards the engine flows through valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and then through a passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located in filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (which forms a portion of the fuel line leading to the engine). The sealing engagement of filter structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with valve body <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> utilizes a sealing member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and prevents fluid from directly entering interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and requires fuel exiting valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be communicated to filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> though passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and enter interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by passing through filter element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which, in the illustrated embodiment, is a paper filter element. As shown in the Figures, sealing members <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are used to provide filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a fluid tight seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with helical threads <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which are engageable with helical threads <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> located on housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> whereby lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removably attachable to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of fuel filtering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Removal of lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides access to filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> whereby a spent fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be replaced or repaired or other components, e.g., valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are at least partially disposed within filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> defined by housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be accessed. Attachment of lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted in fuel filtering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by positioning fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and attaching lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whereby lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> secures the fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and causes the opening of valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned within housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and is operably disposed in the fuel line between the fuel source and the engine. Valve body <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends from fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and defines valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which defines a second portion of the fuel line disposed in the fuel between the fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defines an interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and when filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted in filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is partially disposed within interior volume <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As can also be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, valve opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are all positioned along a common axis <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not present in filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the absence of fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, including portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, is spaced from actuating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is in the closed position. Thus, because lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> does not engage actuating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or otherwise biasingly engage valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, valve member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> remains in the closed position when lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the absence of fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and fuel is thereby prevented from entering into filter cavity <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. By preventing the passage of fuel through valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not present to filter contaminants from the fuel, fuel filtering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prevents unfiltered fuel from reaching the engine and avoids the potential injector damage, the collection of contaminant particles within the valves of the engine, clogging of fuel injector jets, and scoring of the internal surfaces of the engine which can result from the use of unfiltered fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that while the mechanical interconnection in the valve has been shown to shut the outlet valve of the fuel pump, an alternative arrangement could be used, such as a switch which is activated when both filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are secured in place. Such a switch would be in the closed position when the fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is installed and the filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is secured in place. However, if either the filter lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the fuel filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> were missing, the switch would be in the open position. Such a switch would be placed in series connection with the fuel pump, thereby automatically shutting off the fuel pump when no filter is in place and/or when the filter lid has not been secured to the filter housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By placing the valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the outlet of fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the closure of valve mechanism prevents the discharge of fuel from pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when in the closed position. Placing valve mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the inlet to fuel pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would not provide this advantage. </paragraph>
