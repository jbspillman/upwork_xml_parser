<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally related to haptic interface devices and, more particularly, is related to a system and method for controlling the shape of and/or for receiving information pertaining to a surface and/or a volume of a digital clay device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Significant prior research has been performed in the area of haptic interfaces. Several haptic-based interaction systems have been developed and used for a variety of applications, including molecular dynamics simulation and steering, manipulation of nano-materials, surgical training, virtual prototyping, and digital sculpting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Early haptic interface systems utilized a robot arm, both as a six degree-of-freedom input device as well as a force feedback output device, providing the user with a tactile perception of molecular forces and torques. Since then, alternative force-feedback devices with multiple degrees of freedom have been proposed. These approaches provide an intuitive interface for the manipulation of rigid bodies subjected to inertial, contact, or other forces. They are, however, significantly less convenient for sensing and altering the shape of curves and surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These haptic devices and techniques focus on force feedback, which assists the user in gauging the effort required to be exerted on the surface in order to achieve the desired shape alteration. This approach may also be used to provide information about the stiffness or density of the surface. In addition, such haptic approaches have been applied to the exploration of a field in a volume or even of fluid dynamics. However, these approaches do not provide sufficient tactile feedback regarding the shape of the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Running the tip of a computer cursor over the virtual surface has been suggested as a means for &ldquo;haptic surface rendering&rdquo; and have been extended to real-time detection of contacts when manipulating an object with six degrees of freedom. The contact forces may be computed using the concept of &ldquo;virtual proxy&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Such approaches, based on exploration of a surface with the tip or side of a stylus, produce forces that would result from contact, palpation, or stroking actions. These forces may reveal surface anomalies or attract the attention of the designer to small, high-spatial-frequency features that may have been more difficult to detect visually. However, stylus-based approaches are far from exploiting the natural ability of a designer to feel a surface by touching it with a wider area of the hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Interfaces involving touch have used gloves, manipulators controlling a stylus held by the hand, and arrays of actuators to depict a surface. They attempt to supply sensations received through our various touch and kinesthetic receptors, often broken into several regimes. Vector macro forces are at the gross end of that scale and are readily displayed by manipulator-like haptic devices. Vibrations are by nature a scalar field and may be distributed widely over the surface of the skin. The amplitude and frequency are noticeable but not the direction. The most difficult to display are small shapes, for which arrays of stimulators are necessary. To achieve both kinesthetic and tactile sensations simultaneously the combination of a haptic manipulator and a tactile array is currently required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A stylus grasped by a user is one way to explore a haptic environment in a pointwise fashion. If the stylus is attached to a manipulator, interaction forces can be generated which represent interaction of the stylus with a virtual world. Available pointwise haptic displays allow forces and moments to be fed back to the user in two to six degrees of freedom and are well suited to provide the kinesthetic portion of a haptic experience. Haptic mice enable the user to feel the transition of the cursor between different regions of the screen. These haptic manipulators open new possibilities of interfacing, but are comparable to displaying a picture to a viewer one pixel at a time. Haptic manipulators must provide spatial relationships only through temporal sequencing, greatly compromising their efficiency. Sample rates of 1000 Hz are typical with forces controlled at 30 Hz or more for adequate display of features such as a breast tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is necessary to provide a totally synthetic view of the hand in the environment if haptics are coordinated with vision. Viewing the stylus and its device provides no supporting optical illusion. Another disadvantage of the numerous devices is that the ratio of the smallest to the largest displayable force is difficult to expand. When the hand should be moving unimpeded, it still must exert a force to move the device forward. This problem has been only partially overcome by utilizing a servomechanism based on the position of the hand to avoid contact (i.e., achieve 0 force) except when contact should be displayed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system and method for controlling the surface and/or volume of a digital clay device. Briefly described, in architecture, one embodiment is a method comprising the following steps: determining a desired position of a skeleton structure portion residing in the digital clay device, determining a volumetric change of a fluid residing in a bladder, the determined volumetric change corresponding to the determined desired position of the skeleton structure portion, opening a micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) valve so that the fluid flows through the MEMS valve thereby causing the determined volumetric change of the fluid residing in the bladder, and adjusting a position of the skeleton structure portion corresponding to the desired position of the skeleton structure portion, the position adjustment caused by a force generated by the bladder on the skeleton structure portion when the volume of the bladder changes in response to the determined volumetric change of the fluid residing in the bladder. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system and method for controlling the shape of and/or for receiving information pertaining to a surface, or a volume, or both, of a digital clay device. When operating in one mode, the surface or volume is detected and determined by the present invention, a digital clay device, as described herein, such that a processing system embodiment digitally computes attributes relating to a state of the digital clay device surface and/or volume. When the present invention is operating in a shape and/or volume controlling mode, the processing system embodiment digitally computes desired attributes relating to the surface, or volume, or both, and instructs the digital clay device to deform to the desired attributes. Determination of attributes of the digital clay device surface and/or volume, and/or control of the digital clay device surface and/or volume, may be done statically or dynamically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In engineering, art, science, medicine and/or communication, shape is a key feature for product design, sculpting, interpreting and/or understanding complex data and the relation between geometrical features. Also, many in our society depend on touch as a substitute for sight and are increasingly disenfranchised in visually dominated electronic communication in school and in everyday life. An effective means to specify (input) and display shapes to/from the computer is provided by the present invention, a digital clay device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Natural clay is ideally a continuous medium. That is, it ideally has infinite resolution. Although digital clay is actually spatially discrete, with respect to human perception, the micro-sized nature of an individual cell of the digital clay device achieves a virtual infinite resolution with respect to human visual and tactile perception. Thus, digital clay, in one embodiment, has a texture and feel similar to natural clay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a digital clay device is a distributed input/display device whose surface and/or volume can-be shaped by a human user and immediately acquired by a processing system. Or, the surface and/or volume can be shaped by the processing system for the human to examine. Like ordinary clay, digital clay allows a surface or volume to be touched, reshaped with pressure and seen by the user in true three-dimensional form. Unlike ordinary clay, digital clay also provides parameters to the processing system that will represent the shape for the surface and/or volume to the processing system for further analysis, storage, replication, communication and/or modification. Accordingly, digital clay allows the processing system to command its shape and/or volume, providing two-way communication between the processing system and the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The digital clay employs a fluid flow from a plurality of micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) valves to and from a large array of bladders. In one embodiment, the bladder array allows any variety of shapes (surface or volume) for a parallel-actuated structure covered with an elastomeric external skin. Stereolithography enables the efficient production of the actuated structure. Measurement by sensors coupled to the MEMS valves allows feedback control of the MEMS valves, thereby enabling the processing system to read or command the shape of the digital clay device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When operating in a mode of controlling a shape and/or volume, the surface and/or volume of the digital clay is extended (or retracted) by the processing system controlled array of MEMS valves that allow pressurized fluid to flow into a massively parallel-actuated structure having bladders and a skeleton, thereby selectively extending (or retracting) selected portions of the surface and/or volume. The MEMS valves, in one embodiment, are located on a backplate and fluid is &ldquo;piped&rdquo; into the bladders, as described herein according to the present invention. MEMS valves move microscopically to allow fluid flow into/from a controlled bladder. Bladder fluid changes cause macroscopic displacements in the surface or volume of the digital clay device. With coordination of numerous MEMS valves, the characteristics of the digital clay surface or volume is controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When operating in a mode of detecting and determining a shape and/or volume, a user applies an external force to the surface and/or volume of the digital clay device. Fluid is expelled from the bladders and through an array of MEMS valves. Shaping digital clay is fundamentally a removal and/or relocation process. Embedded sensors coupled to the MEMS valves allow actuator displacement and/or other parameters to be sensed directly, or computed from, sensed values. Accordingly, the sensors detect fluid changes in the bladders. Thus, when a force is applied to the digital clay surface, the MEMS valves are selectively allowed to open to avoid singular conditions internal to the digital clay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A first digital clay embodiment is a &ldquo;chunk of clay&rdquo; that sits on a table top. Another embodiment is held by a user. Applications for the table top embodiment include, but are not limited to, terrain models, conceptual shape models of engineered products (e.g., cars), styling models for architecture and industrial design, and artistic sculpture. For the user held embodiment, applications include, but are not limited to, animation/claymation characters, conceptual design models of hand-held engineered devices, toys, and medical models of organs (shape and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of one or more organs). </paragraph>

Thus, the bladders <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> move within the skeleton in the unrestrained direction(s) as fluid is removed from or added to the bladders <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. That is, skeleton structure portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> constrain movement of the bladders <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to a desired direction(s) when the volume of the bladders <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the digital clay device, the skeleton structure portions are selectively coupled together. Coupling may be either rigidly or flexibly. That is, flexible joints or hinges may be used to couple the skeleton structure portions. Accordingly, it is understood that a skeleton having a plurality of skeleton structure portions is used to provide a skeleton that moves in a predictable manner. And, the position of the individual skeleton portions define the shape of the skeleton. Movement of the skeleton is definable by changes in the position of skeleton members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Various control signals and information signals communicated from and/or to processor system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are processed by the digital clay logic <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> residing in the processor system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If a second processor system <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is employed to coordinate communication of signals, and/or generate control signals, as described herein, a portion of the digital clay logic <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> may reside in the second processor system <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a MEMS valve is configured to open when a pressure differential across the MEMS valve exceeds a predetermined pressure difference. The MEMS valve, in one embodiment, is controlled mechanically by the pressure difference. In another embodiment, the MEMS valve is controlled electronically based upon sensed pressure differences. Accordingly, if an external force applied to a bladder increases bladder pressure, and the resultant pressure difference exceeds the predefined pressure difference, the MEMS valve opens to allow fluid to flow from the bladder to the low pressure reservoir <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if an external force applied to a bladder decreases bladder pressure, and the resultant pressure difference exceeds the predefined pressure difference, the MEMS valve opens to allow fluid to flow from the high pressure reservoir <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> into the bladder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, rate of change information in the bladder pressures, generated by external forces, may be determined. This determined rate of pressure change allows determination of the rate of change of the skeleton portions, and accordingly, allows determination of the rate of change of the digital clay device surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary cell bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> embodiment. For convenience, bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a cylindrical shape. Two pipes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) are illustrated. As described above, pipes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> provide for the transfer of fluid into and out of the cell <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, as described above for cell <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). For convenience, skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being shaped as a tube. Skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> includes an outer wall <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and an inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is approximately the same diameter of the bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. For illustrative purposes, a portion of the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is illustrated as having a cut-away section <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. (Accordingly, non visible portions of the bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> are denoted with dashed lines.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thus, as fluid is added to bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in contact with the inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is kinematically constrained from moving in an outward direction (normal to the inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>). Thus, as the bladder expands, the top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> of bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> moves in an upward direction (assuming that the bottom of bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is constrained), as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. Similarly, as the bladder deflates, the top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> of bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> moves in a downward direction (assuming that the bottom of bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is constrained), as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being in contact with a member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being in contact with a skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Thus, movement of the top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in the upward direction (when fluid is added into bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) causes the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to move upward by a corresponding amount. Similarly, movement of the top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in the downward direction (when fluid is removed from bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) causes the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to move downward by a corresponding amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and their associated components, as described above and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, demonstrate selected aspects of the present invention. That is, movement of a bladder within a separate skeleton can control movement of a remote surface. Furthermore, for simplicity, a member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> was used to illustrate one possible way to couple the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to the bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments may use multiple members coupled to a plurality of digital clay surface portions. Or, the top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may be in direct contact with the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> (assuming that the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is configured appropriately). Also, the member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is illustrated as representing a dowel, rod, bar of the like. It is understood that the member may be constructed of any suitable material and may have any suitable configuration without departing substantially from the present invention. Thus, the member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may be a composite material, a rigid material, or even a semi-rigid material. In one embodiment, member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are fabricated as a single unit, or fabricated together as a portion of a complex skeleton structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is that for convenience, the simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> were illustrated as a having a cylindrical shape. It is understood that the simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may have any suitable shape. For example, the simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may have a plurality of flat sides, such as a triangle, square, hexagon or other suitable multiple sided shape to facilitate the fabrication of a cell matrix having a plurality of adjacent cells (bladders <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, skeleton structure portions <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and associated components). Furthermore, portions of the simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and/or skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be curvilinear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Also, it is understood that a unitary body skeleton <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> configured to kinematically restrain movement of a plurality of bladders may be constructed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> illustrates one such embodiment, wherein the skeleton <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is configured to restrain many bladders (not shown) residing in cavities <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. Thus, individual walls <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> of the skeleton <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> restrain multiple bladders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> With the simplified bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and their associated components, as described above and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, range of movement of the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> afforded by the movement of the top surface <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is ultimately limited by the maximum volume of fluid that can be added to or removed from bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. When bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> are fabricated using micro technologies described herein, the range of movement provided by a single bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is not perceptible by a user of the digital clay device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of a bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> employing a plurality of stacked bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D. It is understood that the stacked bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D are illustrated for convenience as being shaped in a cylindrical form, similar to bladder <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Accordingly, bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D are configured to fit together within the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) to form bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. Thus, the total range of movement that may be imparted onto the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> equals the sum of the individual range of motion for each one of the bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D. It is understood that any desirable number of bladders may be used in a bladder unit. Furthermore, it is understood that bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D may be shaped to fit within any type of skeleton. For example, but not limited to, the bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D could be shaped so as to reside in one of the cavities <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> of skeleton <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also, the bladders <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>A-D are illustrated as employing a single pipe <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> configured to transfer fluid into or out of its respective bladder, as described above in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Thus, it is understood that for any of the bladder embodiments, skeleton embodiments and or combined bladder-skeleton embodiments described herein, that fluids may be transferred into or removed from using the embodiments described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Skeleton structure portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), and bladders <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, respectively, are illustrated for convenience as being separate components. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an embodiment wherein the bladder and the skeleton are formed as a single bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is illustrated for convenience as employing a single pipe <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> configured to transfer fluid into or out of its respective bladder, as described above in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Another bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> embodiment transfers fluids into or from using the bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> has eight sides; a top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, a bottom side <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> (hidden from view), an upper right-hand side <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, a lower right-hand side <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> (hidden from view), an upper left-hand side <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, a lower right-hand side <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> (hidden from view), a front side <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> and a back side <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> (hidden from view). The front side <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> and the back side <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> are flexible, but are restrained to moving (stretching) in directions normal to the other sides <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. (That is, the front side <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> and the back side <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> do not bulge substantially inward or outward when fluid is added to or removed from the bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, sides <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> are rigid, or relatively rigid. Adjacent sides are coupled together as shown with a hinging device <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. Thus, a hinge <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> couples the upper right-hand side <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> to the lower right-hand side <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a hinge <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> couples the upper left-hand side <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and the lower left-hand side <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, a hinge <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> couples the top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> with the upper right-hand side <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, and a hinge <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> couples the top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> with the upper left-hand side <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. It is understood that two similar hinges couple the bottom side <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> to the lower right-hand side <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> and to the lower right-hand side <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as fluid is added to or removed from the bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and/or the bottom side <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> move in an upwards or downwards direction, as indicated by the direction arrow <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>. Depending upon the particular digital clay device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is used, the top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> or the bottom side <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> may be fixed to a rigid structure, thereby limiting movement to the opposing side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For example, as fluid is added into the bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is forced to move in an upwards direction (particularly if the bottom side is in a fixed position). Thus, the angle <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> (formed by the joining of the upper right-hand side <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> to the lower right-hand side <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>) and the angle <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> (formed by the joining of the upper left-hand side <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to the lower left-hand side <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>) increase. Concurrently, the angles <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> (formed by the joining of the other sides as shown) decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as fluid is removed from the bladder-skeleton unit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the top side <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is forced to move in a downwards direction (particularly if the bottom side is in a fixed position). Thus, the angle <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> and the angle <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> decrease. Concurrently, the angles <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> During fabrication, as described in greater detail below, a plurality of bladder-skeleton units <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be fabricated together. In such an embodiment, resulting in a honey comb-like skeleton matrix, a large cell matrix is formed. Thus, such an embodiment employing a plurality of bladder-skeleton units <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> can be fabricated to form any desired shape, form or size. Also, bladder-skeleton units may be formed having any suitable number of sides and/or curvilinear surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment employing a bladder unit <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> and a skeleton unit <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>. Bladder unit has at least one bladder (as indicated by the pipe <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). A bladder unit <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> may have a plurality of bladders and be constructed in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Skeleton unit <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> has a first member <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, forming an angle <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> therebetweeen. A hinge <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> allows the two members <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to move, thereby changing the angle <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the bladder unit <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> controls the position of the members <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the bladder unit <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> is extended when fluid is added into the bladder, as shown by the direction arrow <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, angle <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> increases. Similarly, when fluid is removed from the bladder unit <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> such that the bladder retracts, angle <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Skeleton unit <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> is a simplified, non-limiting example of a component that provides for angular control of two members <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. Members <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may have any suitable form, such as, but not limited to, bars, rods, plates, curvilinear surfaces, or even object surfaces. Furthermore, it is understood that the skeleton unit <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> may be a portion of a larger integrated skeleton structure used in a digital clay device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment employing a plurality of bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>) to control a linear skeleton structure <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>. Linear skeleton structure <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> is comprised of a plurality of members <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>. Each member <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> is coupled together as shown at point <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>. Point <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> is a flexible connector, such as a pin or flexible portion of a continuous structure, as described in greater detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described above, optional members <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> couple the top of the bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to a point <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>. As fluid is added to the bladders of bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, an upward force is exerted onto its respective point <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> such that the position of the respective coupled members <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> is moved upward, as indicated by the direction arrow <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>. Similarly, as fluid is removed from the bladders of bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, a downward force is exerted onto its respective point <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> such that the position of the respective coupled members <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> is moved downward, as indicated by the direction arrow <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>. Also, if an external downward force is applied to any member <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>, the linear skeleton structure <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> and positions of the individual members <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> are moved such that a corresponding force is generated on the respective bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The force on the bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> causes fluid to be expelled, as described above, such that the new positions of the members <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> are determinable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is understood that the shape of the linear skeleton structure <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>, and the position of any individual member <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>, is controllable by the bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Furthermore, deformations in the shape of the linear skeleton structure <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>, or changes in the position of any individual member <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>, caused by an external force is determinable by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When a plurality of linear skeleton structures <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> are aligned side-by-side to from an array, a surface is defined. The surface may be part of a table top embodiment similar to the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, or may be part of the surface of a volume of digital clay. Furthermore, the top of the plurality of linear skeleton structures <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> may be covered with a flexible digital clay surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as described above, it is understood that each one of the bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is associated with its own skeleton (not shown) such that when fluid is added or removed from individual bladders, forces and movement are generated along the direction shown by the direction arrow <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the skeletons associated with each of the bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the linear skeleton structure <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> may be formed into a single unitary skeleton structure when the digital clay device is fabricated. </paragraph>

Skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> is comprised of a plurality of points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> and optional members <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight>. Points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> are comprised of a flexible connector providing for multiple degrees of freedom of movement, such as a pin or flexible portion of a continuos structure, as described in greater detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> For convenience, the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a rectangular structure having eight points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight>. However, it is understood that the skeleton structure may have any number of points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight>, thereby creating a skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> of any desirable size or shape. Also, for convenience, points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> are illustrated as cubic structures. The points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> may be formed in any suitable shape or configuration. Furthermore, the bladder units are illustrated for convenience as being coupled to the cube shaped points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> in a direction normal to the faces of the cube shaped points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight>. It is understood that bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may be connected across diagonals of the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight>, or even between non-adjacent points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> (when a larger matrix of points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> comprise the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, the selection of the points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> with a bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is a preference made at the time of design and/or fabrication of the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the outside surface of skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight>, or portions thereof, is covered with a digital clay surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). As noted above, the elasticity and texture of the digital clay surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be selected to suit a particular embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G, a</cross-reference> point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> is coupled to one or more bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is understood that the position of any point is controllable and/or determinable by embodiments of the present invention. As described above, optional members <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> couple the ends of the bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to a point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight>. As fluid is added to the bladders of bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, a force is exerted onto its respective point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> such that the position of the respective point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> is moved. Similarly, as fluid is removed from the bladders of bladder unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, a force is exerted onto its respective point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> such that the position of the point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> is moved. Furthermore, if an external force is applied to any point <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight>, the skeleton structure portion <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> and positions of the points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> are moved such that a corresponding force is generated on the respective bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The force on the bladder units <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> causes fluid to be expelled, as described above, such that the new positions of the points <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> are determinable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments of the skeleton structure(s) described herein provide kinematic constraints to the motion of the bladders and/or bladder units in the digital clay device. Measurement of the volume of fluid in each bladder, along with a solution of the kinematics of the skeleton structure, allows the unambiguous determination of the position of the outermost surface of the digital clay device, thereby leading externally to a predictable digital clay surface shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The skeleton structure, in one embodiment, is formed from a scaffolding structure fabricated using stereolithorgraphy (SLA). The skeleton structure is fabricated to support active and passive motion in a very large number of degrees of freedom. Thus, the skeleton structure is a 3-D deformable structure. A SLA scaffolding structure employs a process of building the 3-D skeleton structure by selectively curing photopolymer with an ultraviolet (UV) laser. Accordingly, a skeleton structure fabricated using SLA technologies includes the capability to build portions of the skeleton using any desired arbitrary shape. Intricate interior structures wherein bladders, pipes and skeleton portions may be fabricated as a unit. Also, a skeleton structure fabricated using SLA technologies implements compliant (flexible) joints (hinges) by varying the thickness of interior connections in the skeleton structure. Furthermore, a skeleton structure fabricated using SLA technologies provides for the insertion of sensors during the skeleton structure fabrication process in another embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As described herein, the skeleton structure may be configured using any suitable geometry. Simplified, non-limiting illustrative geometries have been described above in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-G, and elsewhere herein. Very complex geometries may be used to form the skeleton structure (or portions thereof). One embodiment employs a variable geometry truss (VGT). A VGT is a truss structure that actively deforms by changing the lengths of selected links. Accordingly, a skeleton structure employing VGT portions provides for folding structure portions that are easily deformed. For example, but not limited to, a VGT comprised of stacked octahedral truss structures can be completely folded away by actuating the length of selected lateral members by a small amount. Such a VGT structure employed in a digital clay device is advantageous since a small bladder movement results in a very large change of digital clay volume, thus allowing the digital clay device to undergo very large deformations. </paragraph>

At block <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> a second control signal is generated when the measured volumetric change substantially equals the determined volumetric change.
