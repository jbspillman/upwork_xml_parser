<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing an isolation trench filled with a high-density plasma-chemical vapor deposition oxide, which is referred to as an HDPCVD oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Integrated semiconductor products are manufactured by forming integrated circuits on semiconductor wafers. In order to assure a faultless functionability of the semiconductor product, the individual active elements of the integrated circuits, for example field effect transistors or bipolar transistors, must be isolated from one another. This can be achieved, for example, by what is referred to as isolation trenches that are formed in the semiconductor wafer and are subsequently filled with a non-conductive material. These trenches are known as shallow trench isolations and are referred to as STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The method of manufacturing a STI structure that is known from the prior art shall be described in greater detail using FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> pad oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then applied over this pad oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride is usually deposited by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> After the exposure of the mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a trench <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a predetermined depth is etched into the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of a selective etching step through the pad oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). By means of subsequent oxidation steps, the accessible surface of the substrate is oxidized and an oxide layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is thereby formed on the floor of the trench and at the sidewalls of the trench <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). Care is thereby exercised to see that the oxide layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed to such a thickness that it terminates with the pad oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a dielectric layer material, preferably silicon oxide, is deposited into the trench <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and over the surface of the wafer by means of a chemical vapor deposition at a normal pressure, so that an isolation layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed. After a compression or a densification step, wherein the isolation layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is compressed or densified in a nitrogen atmosphere at elevated temperatures, a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) step is undertaken and, as a result of this step, part of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> lying above the mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is eroded or removed, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the complexity of the integrated circuits has greatly increased, so that the size of the circuits have been simultaneously drastically decreased. For this reason, the isolation trenches needed for the separation of the individual active elements were shaped with an aspect ratio that has become greater and greater. However, filling these isolation trenches with a larger aspect ratio, the above-described classic deposition processes, wherein the dielectric material is deposited by chemical vapor deposition at normal pressure, can no longer be used, since, in particular, the deposition of insulation material onto the walls of the isolation trench causes the closure of the trench before the isolation trench is completely filled. The cavities produced by this will prevent optimum isolation properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Due to the increasing complexity in the new technology and the shrinking of elements with the increasing aspect ratio of the isolation trenches connected therewith, one was therefore forced to develop new processes for filling the isolation trenches that allows a complete filling, even given a high aspect ratio. Such a process is a high-density plasma (HDP) oxide deposition. Typically, the HDP deposition process comprises a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with a gas mixture of oxygen, silane and inert gases, such as, for example, argon. In the HDPCVD process, an etching process and a deposition of material occurs simultaneously. In the HDPCVD process, an alternating voltage in a radio-frequency range (RF voltage) is applied to the wafer in the reaction chamber. As soon as the RF voltage is adjacent to the wafer, some of the gas constituents, particularly argon, are ionized in the plasma and accelerated in the direction of the wafer surface. When the ions impact the wafer, material is hurled out of the surface. As a result thereof, dielectric material deposited on the wafer surface is etched off and constrictions, which are formed during the deposition process, are held open. As a result thereof, isolation trenches having a high aspect ratio can also be filled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D illustrate such a simultaneous etching and deposition process in greater detail. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the beginning of the deposition of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>that is formed of the silane (SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and oxygen on the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown. As a result thereof, the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are to be filled between the active regions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. While the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>deposits on the surface, charged ions impact the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which results in an etching of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> simultaneously with the deposition. However, since the etching rate, given a corner, is approximately 3 to 4 times as high as given a horizontal surface, inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) are formed at the corners of the active regions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> during the deposition process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</cross-reference> show the further course of the HDPCVD process with simultaneous etching and deposition until the trench <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is completely filled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the described HDPCVD method, however, a problem can occur that shall be explained in greater detail on the basis of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having an oxide layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a nitride layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is deposited on the oxide layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes isolation trenches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, whose walls are covered with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> also shows the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> partially filled with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As described above, an etching process simultaneously occurs during the deposition of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a HDPCVD method, and this etching can cause the corners of the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the nitride layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the oxide layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be damaged, which damage is represented by reference character <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. It is precisely these exposed edges that are at extreme risk for sputter damage due to their exposed position. The situation after the HDPCVD deposition process is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. The isolation trenches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are completely filled with oxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; however, the damaged areas <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, nitride layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and oxide layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are still present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an image of a damaged area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> registered with a transmission electron microscope. This damaged area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> was produced by a HDPCVD process for filling isolation trenches. Damage of the described type leads to a lowering of the cutoff voltage (array VT), to leakage currents and to a gate oxide degradation (reduced GOX dependability). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,018, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference thereto, discloses a method with which the above-described damage areas can be prevented. According to this patent, a silicon oxide protective layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is applied onto the oxide layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the nitride layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). To that end, an ozone tetraethylorthosilicate or O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-TEOS process is implemented at low pressures or an O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-TEOS process is implemented with a low O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>concentration. After the application of the silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the same is compressed or densified in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of approximately 1000&deg; C. Subsequently, the isolation trenches are filled with the oxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by means of a HDPCVD process. Damage during the HDPCVD process is avoided due to the protective layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, the method disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,018 exhibits the disadvantage that an additional process step, namely the application of the oxide protective layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, must be implemented. In view of the process management in the manufacture of semiconductor components, this causes a considerable added cost in producing the devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on an object of providing a method for the manufacture of HDPCVD oxide-filled isolation trenches that does not exhibit the disadvantages of the prior art. To achieve this object, the method for manufacturing a HDPCVD oxide-filled isolation trench involves the following steps: forming at least one isolation trench in a semiconductor substrate; forming a first silicon oxide layer at the sidewalls and on the floor of the isolation trench by means of an oxidation step; forming a second silicon oxide layer at the sidewalls and on the floor of the isolation trench by use of a first HDPCVD method, which has been adjusted to carry out a relatively high ratio or relationship of depositing to etching; and then depositing a third silicon oxide layer with a second HDPCVD method to fill the isolation trenches with silicon oxide, wherein the second HDPCVD method has been adjusted to have a lower ratio of depositing to etching than in the first or previous HDPCVD step to form the second silicon oxide layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the inventive method, the second silicon oxide layer is formed with an HDPCVD process, which is without a bias voltage between plasma and wafer or only with a slight bias voltage. As a result thereof, an erosion of the deposited, second silicon oxide layer is reduced or even largely prevented. The deposition of the second silicon oxide layer even preferably occurs without erosion, i.e., without etching. Since the HDPCVD method is implemented with clearly reduced etching in the deposition of the second silicon oxide layer, layers and structures that are already present on the semiconductor substrate and, in particular, on the sidewalls and edges of the isolation trench are not damaged or, respectively, eroded. The reduced etching is achieved by means of a low bias voltage that can, in turn, be set via the power coupled into the plasma. The deposition of the second silicon oxide layer can occur without applying bias voltage in order to work practically without etching. The second silicon oxide layer should be deposited to a thickness that assures an adequate protection of the structures covered by the second silicon oxide layer in the following deposition of the third silicon oxide layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The bias voltage is increased only after deposition of the second silicon oxide layer to a predetermined thickness and then the isolation trench is completely filled with oxide with the third silicon oxide layer. As a result of the inventive method, damage that leads to a lowering of the cutoff voltage (array VT), to the leakage currents or to a gate oxide degradation (reduced GOX dependability) is avoided. Compared to the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,018, the process of the present invention exhibits the advantage that the additional process step of U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,018, namely the application of the oxide protective layer by means of O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-TEOS process, is avoided. In view of the process management in the manufacture of semiconductor components, this means a considerably lower outlay for material and time and, thus, a noteworthy saving of costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The inventive method, accordingly, initially works with a relatively high ratio of deposition to etching in the deposition of the silicon oxide with the HDPCVD method and subsequently works with a ratio that is low in comparison thereto. The erosion rate of the deposited silicon oxide is thereby clearly reduced at the beginning compared to the following deposition. The erosion rate can be set via the bias voltage between the wafer and the plasma and via the power coupled into the plasma. In the case of what is referred to as self-biasing, whereby the bias voltage is set from the ratio of the capacitances between the plasma and the wafer, on the one hand, and the plasma and the electrode lying opposite the wafer, on the other hand, the bias voltage is regulated by selecting the power that is coupled in. The deposition of the second and third silicon oxide layers can also occur directly following one another without interruption by means of a single HDPCVD process, whereby only the bias voltage is modified in the deposition of the second and third silicon oxide layers in the form of a single silicon oxide layer. The HDPCVD process, accordingly, is implemented in two steps. In the first step, the deposition occurs at a low or no bias voltage, whereas the bias voltage in the second step is increased up to the desired ratio of deposition to etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the isolation trench comprises a depth between 300 nm and 500 nm, particularly a depth between 350 nm and 450 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments having isolation trenches with a width of less than 0.3 &mgr;m, particularly a width of less than 0.2 &mgr;m are likewise preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxide layer deposited without application of a RF voltage comprises a thickness between 20 nm and 200 nm. A thickness of the oxide layer between 40 nm and 150 nm is quite especially preferred. Since the oxide layer deposited without the application of a RF voltage should, on the one hand, exhibit a specific thickness in order to be able to dependably protect the structures lying therebelow during the HDPCVD process with the applied RF voltage and, on the other hand, the deposition without applied RF voltage can lead to an incomplete filling and cavities in the isolation trenches, the oxide layer deposited within the present invention without applied RF voltage that comprises a thickness between 60 nm and 100 nm, particularly a thickness between 70 nm and 90 nm, are quite specifically preferred. A thickness of approximately 80 nm is ideal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The oxide layer subsequently deposited with the assistance of an applied RF voltage must completely fill the isolation trenches. Embodiments are therefore preferred wherein the oxide layer deposited with the assistance of an applied RF voltage comprises a thickness between 300 nm and 500 nm, and particularly a thickness between 350 nm and 450 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Silicon oxide is preferably employed as a non-conductive material for filling the isolation trenches of the semiconductor component. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) is preferred as the Si source during application of the non-conductive layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The HDPCVD process to form the third layer has an applied RF voltage preferably implemented with a ratio of deposition to etching between 5.0 and 7.0, particularly a ratio of deposition to etching between 5.5 and 6.5. It is also preferred that when the HDPCVD process forming the second oxide layer is implemented with a ratio of deposition to etching of between 300 and 2000. In the HDPCVD process to form the second layer, an RF bias power of&lE;1 KW is preferably selected and the RF bias power of&lE;2 KW is selected during the depositing of the third layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Other advantages and features of the invention will be readily apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, the drawings and claims.</paragraph>
