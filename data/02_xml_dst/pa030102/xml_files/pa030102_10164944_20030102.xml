<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure generally relates to safety shields for medical needles, and more particularly, to safety shields that are extensible to prevent hazardous exposure to a needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Problems associated with inadvertent needle sticks are well known in the art of blood sampling, percutaneous medication injection and other medical procedures involving use of medical needles. Significant attention has been focused on needle stick problems due to the contemporary sensitivity of exposure to AIDS, Hepatitis and other serious blood-borne pathogen exposures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Procedures for removing a needle from a patient commonly require a clinician to use one hand to place pressure at the wound site where a needle is being withdrawn, while removing the needle device with the other hand. It is also common practice for a clinician to give higher priority to care for the wound than is given to disposal of the needle. In the case of typical needle devices without safety shields, such priority either requires the convenience of an available sharps container within reach or another means for safe disposal, without leaving the patient&apos;s side. Thus, the difficulty in providing adequate care while following safety procedures is often compounded by the patient&apos;s physical condition and mental state, such as in burn units and psychiatric wards. Under such conditions, proper disposal of a used needle, while caring for a patient, is a technological challenge to the state of the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The widespread knowledge and history associated with needle care and disposal problems have resulted in numerous devices for preventing accidental needle sticks. Some devices utilize a separate sheath or cap mounted over the needle after use. These devices, however, require two handed manipulation from a practitioner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other known devices employ sheaths that are spring activated, telescoping, pivoting, etc. These devices, however, may disadvantageously misfire or be cumbersome to activate. Further drawbacks of current devices include high manufacturing cost due to complexity and the number of parts. Thus, these type prior art devices may not adequately and reliably shield needle infusion and/or fluid collection apparatus to prevent hazardous exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there remains a need to provide a more satisfactory solution for needle safety devices by overcoming the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a more adequate and reliable medical needle shield apparatus which employs an extensible safety shield to prevent hazardous exposure to a needle. Such a needle shield apparatus should be easily and reliably extendable to shield a needle tip of a needle cannula. It would be desirable if the needle shield apparatus was actuated via one handed operation. It would be highly desirable if the medical needle shield apparatus facilitates efficient assembly and manufacture thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiments of the medical needle shield apparatus and methods of operation disclosed are discussed in terms of medical needles for infusion of intravenous fluids, medication infusion or fluid collection, and more particularly, in terms of needle shield apparatus employed with a needle cannula that prevent hazardous exposure to the needle cannula, including, for example, inadvertent needle stick. It is contemplated that the needle cannula may be shielded during use including storage, transport, fluid infusion and/or collection, subsequent thereto, etc. It is envisioned that the present disclosure, however, finds application to a wide variety of cannula needles and devices for the infusion of preventive medications, medicaments, therapeutics, etc. to a subject. It is also envisioned that the present disclosure may be employed for collection of body fluids including those employed during procedures relating to phlebotomy, digestive, intestinal, urinary, veterinary, etc. It is contemplated that the medical needle shield apparatus may be utilized with other medical needle applications including phlebotomy devices, catheters, catheter introducers, guide wire introducers, spinal and epidural, biopsy, aphaeresis, dialysis, blood donor, Veress needles, Huber needles, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the discussion that follows, the term &ldquo;proximal&rdquo; refers to a portion of a structure that is closer to a clinician, and the term &ldquo;distal&rdquo; refers to a portion that is further from the clinician. As used herein, the term &ldquo;subject&rdquo; refers to a patient that receives infusions or has blood and/or fluid collected therefrom using the medical needle shield apparatus. According to the present disclosure, the term &ldquo;clinician&rdquo; refers to an individual administering an infusion, performing fluid collection, installing or removing a needle cannula from a medical needle shield apparatus and may include support personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The following discussion includes a description of the medical needle shield apparatus, followed by a description of the method of operating the medical needle shield apparatus in accordance with the present disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the figures, wherein like components are designated by like reference numerals throughout the several views. Referring initially to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, there is illustrated a medical needle shield apparatus including an extensible shield, such as, for example, safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, constructed in accordance with the principals of the present disclosure. Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is advantageously configured to prevent hazardous exposure to a needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by providing an adequate and reliable medical needle shield apparatus for a needle infusion and/or fluid collection device which shields a needle via one handed operation, as will be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to a medical needle device, such as, for example, prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to facilitate safe infusion of fluids to a subject (not shown) from a sterile cartridge or the like. Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be attached to prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via spin welding, adhesive, other welding methods, etc. Alternatively, safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be monolithically, integrally connected, etc. with the distal end of prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is employed with a needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> supported by a needle hub <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that a syringe employed may be prefilled with a fluid, such as a pharmaceutical medication or may be a prefillable syringe which is subsequently filled with a medication. It is further contemplated that safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used with other fluid infusion, fluid collection, catheters, introducers, etc., similar to those described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first segment, such as, for example, proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second segment, such as, for example, distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. Distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a circumferential wall, such as, for example, a cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disposed about needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and configured to facilitate extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between a retracted position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and an extended position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), as will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defines a planar surface, such as, for example, a base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, discussed in more detail below, adjacent a distal portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereof. Base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is configured to engage needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for disposing safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the extended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, another advantage of the present disclosure is that safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is easily extendable via one handed activation, resulting in a higher degree of safety to the clinician and subject. Further, this configuration of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> advantageously provides guided extension of the shield to reliably prevent hazardous exposure to needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during manipulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is desirably contemplated for use in the field of medical fluid infusion and/or collection. More particularly, safety shield apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is envisioned to be a disposable needle device employing, among other things, safety features having shielding capabilities to prevent inadvertent sticking or punctures of clinicians and subjects, as well as uniform and dependable movement during a procedure and a locking mechanism for reliable use. The above advantages, among others, realized from the present disclosure are attained through the disclosed safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is extensible to a protective configuration, as discussed hereinbelow. These features of the present disclosure advantageously facilitate a safe infusion and/or collection of fluids and prevent inadvertent needle stick of a clinician and subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is monolithically formed. It is contemplated, however, that the component parts of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be integrally assembled. Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a material suitable for medical applications, such as, for example, polymerics or metals, such as stainless steel, depending on the particular medical application and/or preference of a clinician. Semi-rigid and rigid polymerics are contemplated for fabrication, as well as resilient materials, such as molded medical grade polypropylene. However, one skilled in the art will realize that other materials and fabrication methods suitable for assembly and manufacture, in accordance with the present disclosure, also would be appropriate. Alternatively, portions of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be monolithically formed and assembled therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is articulated to a collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a hinged connection. It is contemplated that the hinged connection of proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be living hinges, pinned hinges, etc., or alternatively, may be movably connected by other structure, such as, ball joint, etc. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a pair of arms <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extend to collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and connect thereto via living hinges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. This configuration provides movement of proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, facilitating extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that one or a plurality of hinged connections may be used. Collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted to an outer surface of a distal end of prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, a luer lock collar <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Luer lock collar <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is disposed about needle hub <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also be mounted directly to needle hub <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or various portions of prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a pair of latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disposed for engagement with a corresponding pair of catches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed with distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Cooperative engagement of latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and catches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> releasably locks safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the retracted position. Latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a female-type configuration for releasably receiving catches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> male-type component part in a snap fit engagement. The releasable locking engagement provides a tactile feel and audible signal that safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To release safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the retracted position, a manual actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides an engagement surface for urging safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the extended position and consequently disengaging catches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that other releasable engagements may be employed such as, for example, friction fit, interference fit, etc., that the male/female components are reversed, or, alternatively that no such releasable engagement is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> articulates from proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a hinged connection. It is contemplated that the hinged connection of proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be living hinges, pinned hinges, etc., or alternatively, may be movably connected by other structure, such as ball joint, etc. A pair of arms <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extend from proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for corresponding connection via living hinges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. This configuration provides movement of distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> relative to proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> facilitating extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that one or a plurality of hinged connections may be used. Upon engagement of manual actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a clinician&apos;s hand, finger, etc., or a table top, etc., safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is urged from the retracted position to the extended position for protecting a sharpened tip <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> after a medical procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which defines an opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is transversely oriented relative to the body of distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is configured such that cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> travels about needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to facilitate extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> provide a cavity to accommodate needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> such that segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> uniformly extend from the retracted position to the extended position via one handed operation. This configuration advantageously maintains safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in alignment with needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during extension thereof. It is contemplated that cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may have alternative configurations, such as, for example, rectangular, elliptical, polygonal, etc., or cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may have various dimensions, according to the requirements of a particular medical needle application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a fulcrum <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 8</cross-reference>A, disposed adjacent a proximal portion thereof to facilitate extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Fulcrum <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is configured to engage needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to facilitate extension of segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the retracted position to the extended position. Fulcrum <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a slot <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> configured to guide needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> therein during extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.

Walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are oriented in a plane substantially transverse to longitudinal axis x. Wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is oriented substantially orthogonal to walls <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be at various angular orientations relative to longitudinal axis x. It is further envisioned that walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be disposed at various angular orientations relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> engages wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and wall <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> which serve as a fulcrum and a guide to extend safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into alignment with longitudinal axis x of needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The resistive forces created via engagement of wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and continued manipulation of manipulable actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> force such extension of segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This configuration facilitates extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via one handed operation. It is contemplated that slot <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may have other configurations such as, for example, arcuate walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, etc., or alternatively, may define a larger or smaller opening, according to the requirements of a particular medical needle application. It is further contemplated that needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may engage only wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> or walls <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A nose portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> projects from opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is in communication therewith via channel <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Nose portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes side walls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that define a cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is configured for disposal of needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> when safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the extended position. Base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends from cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the distal end of nose portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Channel <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connects opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facilitating extension of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extend about needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> travels about needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is caused to travel through cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> approaches the extended position, needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> engages base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forces segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to further extend and align with needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> along longitudinal axis x thereof to dispose safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the extended position. In this position, needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is protectively shielded by nose portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed in the extended position. Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereby prevents hazardous exposure to needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and needle tip <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> thereof. This configuration advantageously protects a clinician and subject from accidental needlestick via one handed operation of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may cover all or a portion of the underside surface of nose portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a barbed flap lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that engages needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to fix safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the extend position. As safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> approaches the extended position, needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> engages base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is thereby caused to engage lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> whereby lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> deflects about needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Continued manipulation of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, via manual actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and corresponding engagement of needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, causes needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to travel over a barbed portion of lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and come to rest on an opposite side thereof. Lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> returns to an undeflected position to non-releasably fix safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the extended position. This provides an added degree of security to the clinician and subject from accidental needle stick. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a barbed flap lock <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, similar to lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, formed on an inner surface thereof. Lock <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, either alone or in cooperation with lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, non-releasably fixes safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the extended position. Other lock configurations are also envisioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In preparation for use of a medical needle shield apparatus, similar to that described above, a medical needle shield, such as, for example, safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled with a medical needle device, such as, for example, prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The method of assembly includes the steps of providing prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> extends from prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A needle cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted to prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and substantially encloses needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured for clearance of needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during attachment of safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is transversely oriented relative to distal segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided for assembly with prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at the end of a manufacturing process for syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Others arrangements are contemplated such as introducing safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at various stages of manufacture of syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned for assembly with prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that needle cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>) and needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, substantially enclosed therein, travel through opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that the component parts of the medical needle shield apparatus may be manipulated for assembly by personnel, mechanical devices, etc. It is further contemplated that the inner surface of cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may or may not engage needle cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> during positioning. Prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may or may not include the needle cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed for mounting with prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As discussed, proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Proximal segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted to an outer surface of prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, via collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, by way of the several mounting and connection methods discussed above. This method of assembly for a medical shield apparatus prevents disturbance of its component parts and advantageously avoids contamination thereof, particularly needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, during manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In use, a medical needle shield apparatus similar to that described above, employing safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is properly sterilized and otherwise prepared for storage, shipment and use. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, a needle cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is used to protect needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Needle cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shields, prior to use and to prevent inadvertent unfolding or actuation, safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the retracted position. After completion of a medical procedure employing prefilled syringe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is manipulated such that latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and catches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disengage. As safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is urged from the retracted position to the extended position via one handed exertion on actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> travels about needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of fulcrum <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> engages needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to extend segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and guide movement thereof, as discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> becomes positioned within cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through channel <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to engage base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Continued pressure exerted on actuator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and corresponding engagement of needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> disposes safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the extended position. In the extended position, nose portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> shields needle tip <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in a protective configuration to prevent hazardous exposure thereto, providing security for a clinician and subject from accidental needle stick. As safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed in the extended position and needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engage, lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> engages needle cannula <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to non-releasably fix safety shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the protective configuration, as discussed. </paragraph>
