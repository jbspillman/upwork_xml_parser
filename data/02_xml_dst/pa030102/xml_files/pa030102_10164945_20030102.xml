<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A fluid system component is provided that includes first and second elements configured to be removably engaged with each other and defining a fluid passageway when engaged. The first element defines three grooves, each of which includes a terminal portion. Correspondingly, the second element includes three engagement members each of which is configured and arranged to be received in, and travel along, a corresponding groove. The presence of a predetermined line pressure in the fluid passageway forces each engagement member into the terminal portion of the corresponding groove, so as to substantially foreclose disengagement of the first and second elements until the fluid pressure in the fluid passageway has reached a predetermined magnitude. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technological Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to fluid system components. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to a fluid system component configured to utilize the line pressure of the fluid system, wherein the fluid system component is employed, in a way that substantially prevents takedown of the fluid system component until the fluid system line pressure, or relative pressure differential, changes to a safe level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, environmental concerns have been receiving significantly more attention, and various governmental agencies have responded by implementing stringent regulations to reduce or prevent pollution. Many of these regulations and concerns are directed towards those industries that transport fluids. For example, it is very difficult to transport a fluid without spilling or leaking some of the fluid into the environment. Thus, some environmental regulations require that minimal leaking occur during handling, processing, or transportation of the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These environmental concerns become especially clear when considering the magnitude of the industries that handle hazardous fluids that, if allowed to escape even in relatively small quantities, can cause significant damage. There is a concern, therefore, to protect both the public and the environment from these types of fluids. While some fluids that are transported, such as water and milk, may not pollute the environment when they are leaked or spilled, the loss of fluid into the environment is nevertheless viewed as a general waste of resources. More generally, the loss of fluid into the environment is not desirable even if the fluid does not contribute to pollution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Within the transportation industry, a variety of different devices are used to transport a fluid from a source to a destination. These devices often use valve assemblies and conduits of various types to both connect the source to the destination as well as to manage fluid flow through the conduit. Typically, the conduit is pressurized to direct fluid toward the desired destination. With each transfer of fluid, there is a risk that leakage will occur due to human error, equipment malfunctions, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A common source of fluid leaks and fluid spills are the valves and other components and devices employed in fluid systems. By way of example, some valves may have leaks that permit flow through the valve even when the valve is secured in the closed position. In other instances, one or more joints defined by constituent elements of the valve, such as in the case of valves designed to be taken down in two or more pieces, and/or one or more joints at least partially defined by the valve, such as a valve-to-flange connection, may be defective, resulting in leakage of some or all of the system fluid. Unfortunately, problems such as these often do not manifest themselves until after flow has been established through the valve, component, or device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, in many instances, the system operator is limited in terms of the affirmative steps that can be taken to prevent a spill that may result from one or more defective joints, and oftentimes can only correct the spill when it occurs. This is true in the case of joints that are defectively assembled, or are otherwise defective upon assembly, as well as in the case of joints that become defective over a period of time due to operating, or other, conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other problems exist as well. For example, various types of valves have been designed to stop, or &ldquo;check,&rdquo; fluid flow through the valve when the valve is taken down into two or more constituent parts or assemblies. One known device for checking fluid flow is a ball check valve. A ball check valve is essentially a ball which rests against a ball seat to form a valve. An operator may use the ball check valve to initiate or terminate the fluid flow. Despite the check feature of the ball check valve, a problem exists in the integrity of the fluid transfer system when the valve or conduit undergoes stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the conduit and the valve are subjected to forces such as stretching, pulling, twisting, and the like, the fluid being transferred through the conduit and the valve may leak or spill into the environment. More particularly, the conduit, rather than the ball check valve, is likely to rupture or otherwise malfunction in the presence of these forces. Thus, while the ball check valve is appropriate for checking fluid flow, it does not prevent spillage or leakage when subjected to external stress. Because the conduit is likely to rupture, or otherwise malfunction, in these types of situations, the spillage or leakage of fluid into the environment can be significant because the fluid flow can no longer be checked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, when a fuel transport vehicle is delivering liquid through a hose into a fuel tank, one end of the hose is attached to the fuel transport vehicle, and the other end of the hose is attached to a fuel tank. A valve such as a ball check valve may be disposed at the vehicle end of the hose such that fluid communication through the hose may be established or checked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the event the fuel transport vehicle drives away with the hose still connected, the connection will likely break or rupture. Because the hose is typically the weakest part of the connection, the break usually occurs somewhere in the hose and fluid escapes into the environment. In this example, the ball check valve typically does not disassemble because it is much stronger than the hose. Even if the ball check valve were to break instead of the hose, fluid would still leak from the system. Such problems are particularly acute in the context of automated environments and operations where few, or no, humans may be present, and a leak may go unnoticed for a relatively long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another concern relates to the coupling and uncoupling of caps, valves, and other fluid system components, that are employed, for example, in fuel, chemical, sewage, or other fluid transfer or processing systems. In particular, typical quick coupling devices are configured so that an operator can uncouple the mating halves of the quick coupling device, even in the presence of line pressure. Such an arrangement is problematic for a variety of reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> By way of example, in the event the line wherein the quick coupling device is located is charged with hazardous materials such as chemicals, sewage, fuels, or gases such as chlorine and methane, the operator performing the uncoupling operation could be seriously injured or killed when such materials escape from the line. Moreover, such hazardous materials are pollutants and significant time and cost is often involved in the cleanup of such materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A related problem with typical quick coupling devices concerns the pressure exerted by the material in the line wherein the quick coupling device is located. In particular, such pressure may cause the halves of the quick coupling device to rapidly come apart in an uncontrolled and dangerous manner, thereby injuring the operator and/or damaging nearby equipment. The forces resulting from such pressure can often be significant, even where the line pressure is relatively low. Thus, in a six inch diameter (nominal) pipe for example, even a relatively low pressure of 10 lbs./in.<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(&ldquo;psi&rdquo;) would exert a force of about one thousand (1000) pounds on a pipe cap attached to the end of the pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Not only are such pressures dangerous, but operators may not have any way to verify, in advance of performing the uncoupling operation, whether or not the line is pressurized. Further, even if an operator is aware that pressure is present, the operator may, through inattentiveness, negligence, or for other reasons, nevertheless attempt to uncouple the quick coupling device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, what is needed is a fluid system component having features directed to addressing the foregoing exemplary considerations, as well as other considerations not disclosed herein. More particularly, an exemplary fluid system component includes features directed to facilitating the secure engagement, and ready disengagement, of the mating halves of the fluid system component, while at the same time preventing intentional or accidental disengagement of the mating halves when a predetermined pressure is present in the line. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In general, embodiments of the invention are concerned with a fluid system component that, among other things, facilitates the secure engagement, and ready disengagement, of mating halves of the fluid system component, while at the same time preventing intentional or accidental disengagement of the mating halves when a predetermined pressure is present in the line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, a fluid system component is provided that includes mating male and female halves. The male half of the fluid system component includes a wall having an outer surface wherein a plurality of grooves are defined. The grooves are generally configured so that each of a plurality of rollers present on the outer surface of a wall of the female half of the fluid system component enters, and travels along, a corresponding groove as the male and female halves are rotatably engaged together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Further, the grooves defined in the male half of the fluid system component are configured to define an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the fluid system component, so that the male and female halves advance toward each other as they are rotatably engaged. Each of the grooves also includes a terminal segment that is connected with, but offset from, the intermediate and entry segments of the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In operation, the male and female portions are brought together until each roller of the female portion has engaged a corresponding groove of the male portion. The two halves are then rotated in opposite directions, causing the rollers to advance along their corresponding grooves and thereby move the male and female halves toward each other. The two halves continue to rotate until each roller enters the terminal segment of its corresponding groove, at which point engagement is completed. Thus engaged, the male and female halves cooperate to define a fluid passageway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The introduction of a pressurized fluid into the fluid passageway acts on the fluid system component in such a way that a force is exerted that resists movement of the rollers out of the terminal segment and back into the intermediate or entry segments of the groove. Thus, the groove geometry affords the fluid system component the capability to use the line pressure in such a way as to prevent disengagement of the fluid system component halves until the line is suitably depressurized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> These and other aspects of embodiments of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims. </paragraph>

However it will be appreciated that fluid source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and/or fluid destination <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, may comprise any of a variety of different static or mobile structures and vehicles. Such structures and vehicles include, but are not limited to, air, water, or land vehicles, such as, but not limited to, trucks, boats, automobiles, motorcycles, ships, railcars, aircraft, and the like, as well as structures such as tanks, reservoirs, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In operation, a pressure differential is established between fluid source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and fluid destination <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so as to cause flow of the fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the desired direction. It will be appreciated that the pressure differential may be established in such a way as to cause flow to proceed in the opposite direction as well. The pressure differential may result from the force of gravity, or may alternatively be established by various types of equipment and devices including, but not limited to, pumps and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In general, dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> facilitates management and control of fluid flow between fluid source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and fluid destination <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In particular, valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> allows for selective establishment and termination of fluid communication between fluid source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and fluid destination <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Additionally, dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> facilitates releasable engagement of two different fluid system components, for example, fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and fluid source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Finally, dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes various features which substantially prevent fluid leakage should the discrete portions of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> be separated for any reason. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. As used herein, the portion of the valve assembly closest to the fluid source is referred to as the source housing while the other housing portion is referred to as the destination portion. Either portion of the dry break valve assembly can be the source housing or the destination housing. Coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> serves to removably secure first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in a substantially leakproof engagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Substantially disposed within first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, respectively, are flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B. In general, flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B facilitate management of fluid flow through conduits, or the like, connected to first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, respectively. Also disposed within first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and discussed in greater detail below, is an actuating mechanism (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), which serves to manipulate the position of flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B in response to input provided by way of actuating lever <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Thus, the position of the flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B may vary between fully open and fully closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> First housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes a conduit connector <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>A. Conduit connector <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>A is configured to attach to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), wherein such attachment may be accomplished in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, welding, brazing, soldering, and the like. Alternatively, conduit connector <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>A may comprise a compression fitting, threaded fitting, or the like for attaching to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In similar fashion, second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a conduit connector <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A. Conduit connector <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A is configured to attach to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, wherein such attachment may be accomplished in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, welding, brazing, soldering, and the like. Alternatively, conduit connector <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A may comprise a compression fitting, threaded fitting, or the like for attaching to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that conduit connector <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>A and/or conduit connector <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A may, alternatively, be connected directly to fluid source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or fluid destination <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and with continuing attention to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, additional details regarding coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are provided. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and a second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B joined together by collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which serves to substantially prevent relative motion between first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and a second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and a second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B each comprise an outward extending annular ridge or the like which, when brought into a confronting relation with each other, are collectively configured to mate with corresponding structure defined by collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, as suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. It will be appreciated however, that coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, either individually or collectively, may be configured in any number of alternate ways that would facilitate achievement of the functionality disclosed herein. In addition the connecting portions of the engaging portions <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B may be ridged to ensure that relative motion between the portions does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and a second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B each further includes a plurality of pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> that mate with corresponding grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B, defined by first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, respectively. Thus, a rotary motion imparted to coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> by way of handles <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> releasably joins first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and a second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B to first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, respectively, by causing pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to travel to the respective ends of grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B are of such a length that a rotary motion of about <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> degrees is adequate to releasably couple first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that a rotary motion of about 120 degrees in the opposite direction will be effective to disengage coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and thus release first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> from second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the arrangement of coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> with respect to first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be varied in a number of ways. For example, in one embodiment, first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A is integral with first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, so that only second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B comprises pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Correspondingly, only grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B are present and grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B are not required. In this embodiment, a rotation, preferably about 120 degrees, imparted to coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> by way of handles <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> causes rotating pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, or bearings in another embodiment, to travel the length of grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B so that coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> thereby releasably joins first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment employs essentially a reverse configuration of that just discussed. In particular, in this embodiment, second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B is integral with second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and only first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A includes pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Correspondingly, only grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B are present and grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B are not required. In this embodiment, a rotation, preferably about 90 degrees, imparted to coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> by way of handles <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> causes pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to travel the length of grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B so that coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> thereby releasably joins first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Finally, it will be appreciated that other types of structure and devices may be usefully employed to achieve the functionality collectively provided by pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B. Accordingly, other structures and devices that provide such functionality are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention, wherein such other structures and devices include, but are not limited to, threaded connections, spring-biased connections, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and with continuing attention to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, additional details regarding collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are provided. In particular, collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> further includes a breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Generally, breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> serves two primary purposes. First, breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> serves to retain collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> securely in place about first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B of collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Further, breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a sacrificial element that is designed to break, thereby allowing first engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>A and second engaging portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>B to separate from each other, when a force, or forces, of predetermined magnitude are applied to particular elements of fluid transfer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as to valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In effect, when the sacrificial element breaks, then the coupling <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is no longer capable of joining the first and second housings of the valve assembly and the valve assembly disassembles into two separate components. As previously described, fluid flow from each separate housing may be checked and when the valve assembly separates in this manner, fluid flow is checked and fluid spillage or leakage is thereby minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is essentially C-shaped, having an opening between its two ends. Breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is disposed across the opening thus defined and includes a threaded member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, such as a bolt or the like, defining a bore (not shown) near one end. Preferably, the bore thus defined is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of threaded member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. A shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is slidably disposed in the bore and the opposing ends of shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> are received in collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> as indicated. Preferably, shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is prevented from exiting the bore by way of cotter pins <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, or the like, disposed at either end of shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may alternatively be glued, welded, brazed, or otherwise bonded to collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> so as to prevent it from exiting the bore in threaded member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> further includes a nut <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, or the like, engaged for advancement along threaded member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In operation, nut <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> is rotated so as to advance along threaded member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and thus draw the opposing ends of collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> securely together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The operation of breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> proceeds generally as follows. In the event a force, or forces, of predetermined magnitude in either a tensile or axial load are applied to valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> will fracture and the valve assembly will disassemble. It will be appreciated that the materials and/or geometry of shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may desirably be varied to adjust the point at which fracture will occur. It will further be appreciated that sacrificial elements other than shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may usefully be employed. In general, any sacrificial element and/or breakable link assembly that provides the functionality, disclosed herein, of shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and/or breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Upon fracture of shear pin <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, threaded member separates from collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, thus permitting the ends of collar <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to move apart and thereby allow separation of first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The functionality provided by breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> thus ensures that in the event a predetermined level of force is applied to dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or to components to which it is connected, dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will break dry, and thus substantially prevent any material leakage of fluid. Further, breakable link assembly <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> substantially ensures that in the event such forces are applied, no material damage occurs to the components of fluid transfer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Thus, in addition to minimizing the fluid loss that would otherwise occur, the conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is preserved and damage is not done to the fluid source or the fluid destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Note that a variety of means may be profitably employed to perform the functions enumerated herein, of sealingly engaging first housing <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with second housing <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> using coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is an example of means for sealingly engaging first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the structure disclosed herein simply represents one embodiment of structure capable of performing this function. It should be understood that this structure is presented solely by way of example and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and its various parts may be made of a range of materials depending on the type of fluid being transferred. Preferably, a material is chosen that can withstand corrosion and high temperature thermal cycling, such as carbon steel or stainless steel. Generally, valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be constructed from Austenitic steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an exploded perspective view of various features of the flow control assemblies of valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The following description of the housing configuration and flow control assemblies is by illustration only and not by way of limitation. Generally, flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A may comprise a flow control member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A, a guide <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A, a resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A, a fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, and a snap ring <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>A. Similarly, flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B may comprise a flow control member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>B, a guide <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B, a resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B, a sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and a snap ring <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B have a flow control member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>B, respectively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, flow control members <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>B have a round disc-like valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B, respectively. Valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A contains a bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> substantially in the center of the valve gate so as to allow a substantially cylindrical piece to pass through the bore. It will be understood that bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may be any geometrical shape (e.g., square, rectangular, polygonal, etc.) that will allow passage of a corresponding geometrical-shaped piece to pass through the bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Attached to valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A is a hollow driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is placed in transverse relation to valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is substantially concentric with bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and contains substantially the same geometric shape as bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Attached to valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B is a member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, which may be solid or hollow. Driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may be attached to valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B by any means known in the art, such as, but not limited to, welding, adhesive bonding, or may be formed integrally with valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> further illustrates guides <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B. Guides <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B essentially add structural support to flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B. Guides <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B contain bores <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>B whose inner diameters correspond respectively with the outer diameters of driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In practice, driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> slidably passes through bore <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>A, and, similarly, member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> slidably passes through bore <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, guides <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B are essentially hollow except for three support bars generally designated as <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>B. The hollow structure allows for structural members to pass through guides <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B and to be movably connected to valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B, which will be discussed in further detail later in this specification. However, it will be appreciated that guides <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>B may be constructed having a partially solid configuration as long as the requisite area is present to allow for movement of parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B which are placed onto driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and solid member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, respectively. Resilient members <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to be springs. However, one skilled in the art will understand that resilient members <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B may be any structure which maintains a bias such as, but not limited to, a rubber material, an elastic material, polished metal, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> further depicts fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and corresponding sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The configuration of fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> will be discussed in more detail later in this specification. However, in general terms, fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is tapered on one side to provide a valve seat for valve gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A. Similarly, sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is tapered on one side to provide a valve seat for valve gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, valve gates <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>B have corresponding tapers to allow for better sealing engagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are configured to allow for placement of flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B to be disposed substantially within each housing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows ridge <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> placed on the interior surface of first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Ridge <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> acts as structural support for flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A. During assembly, guide <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>A rests on ridge <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. Resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A is slid onto driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, after which flow control member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A is placed into first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> with driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> passing through bore <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>A. Finally, fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is placed into first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to complete the flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A. It will be understood from the drawings and foregoing discussion that flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B may be assembled in a manner similar to that for flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It will be noted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, that second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a ledge <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> to provide a similar structural function as ridge <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may have structural ridges and grooves on the interior surface of the housing to provide for better structural engagement of corresponding parts of flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, snap rings <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>B are provided for a better sealing engagement when flow control assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B are assembled and for easier disassembly during maintenance of the valve assembly. In another embodiment, valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B may have an O-ring placed along the taper to provide for better sealing engagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-section of an exemplary embodiment of the dry break valve assembly, illustrating the sealing engagement between first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. First housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are joined in sealing engagement preferably in at least two ways&mdash;at their outer rims and between fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the outer rims of first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in sealing engagement. During assembly of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> acts to join the outer rims of first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to join them in sealing engagement. Tightening of the coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> further acts to seal valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Preferably, L-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B are configured such that sealing engagement occurs when pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are engaged with L-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a sealing feature is also provided between fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is provided with a tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> running circumferentially around fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. Similarly, sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is provided with a corresponding tapered channel <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> running circumferentially around sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The terms &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; and &ldquo;circumferential&rdquo; are adopted herewith to describe tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> and tapered channel <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> since tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> is disposed around the perimeter of an interior cavity formed within fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. Thus, peripheral tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> peripherally defines the opening of a cavity formed through fitting member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. By providing ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> with tapered surfaces, greater surface area is provided which allows an improved sealing engagement without increasing the diameter of the embodiment as is required, for example, to increase the sealing surface area when using a common flange joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is provided with compressing edge <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> which biases compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> against abutting edge <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> of fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. Coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> attaches to the external surface of sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> by the twist coupling method discussed previously and described in more detail hereinafter. Compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, serves a dual purpose. Compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> provides compensation due to &ldquo;creeping&rdquo; (degradation of the seal due to thermal contraction) which occurs at low temperatures. Compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> also serves to bias coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in a direction which will hold pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> in the L-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B and thus provides the tension necessary for proper operation of the twist coupling. In this regard, when pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are seated in the L-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B, compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> biases fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> towards sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and thus assists in forming a proper seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As can be seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is provided with an abutting edge <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> while coupler <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is provided with a compressing edge <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. One pin <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and L-shaped groove <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B can be seen in the lower portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is positioned so that compressing edge <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and abutting edge <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> are urged apart. Pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B, and compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, are arranged such that sealing contact between tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> and tapered channel <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> occurs when pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are situated in grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B. This arrangement provides that when pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are received in the grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B, compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is partially or fully compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> may be replaced by structures other than that shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> above. For example, if the embodiment is to be used only under moderate temperature and pressure conditions, compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> may be a washer of a resilient or elastic material, such as rubber. Depending upon the application, those skilled in the art will be able to determine what alternative structures and materials may be used for compensating washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. The washer(s) <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is preferably compressible so as to allow pins <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to seat in grooves <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>B while urging tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> into sealing engagement with tapered channel <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. This arrangement provides a coupling which is highly resistant to loosening due to vibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> By the above-described arrangement, tapered ridge <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> is held in tight sealing arrangement with tapered channel <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. Note that a variety of means may be profitably employed to perform the functions enumerated herein, of providing a sealing engagement between first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Fitting member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are examples of means for sealingly engaging first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the structure disclosed herein simply represents one embodiment of structure capable of performing these functions. It should be understood that this structure is presented solely by way of example and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an actuating mechanism is used to operate the flow control assemblies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of an actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Preferably, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> uses cam action in operation. Cam action refers generally to a sliding piece in a mechanical linkage used especially in transforming rotary motion into linear motion or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> has a cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. Cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> provides three attachment sites, <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>B. Attached to site <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is cam arm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, which in turn is connected to driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> at attachment site <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>. Driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to be essentially cylindrical in shape. However, it will be understood that driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be any geometric shape which will correspond with driver shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and guide bore <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>A. Driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is essentially a mechanical piece for imparting motion to components of the dry break valve assembly as will be discussed in further detail later in the specification. Attached to sites <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>B are displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B. Displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to be essentially rectangular in shape. However, it will be understood that displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B may be manufactured in any geometric shape, such as cylindrical, elliptical, square, and the like, without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Preferably the connections of driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B to cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> at sites <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>B are pin connections such that the parts may be movably connected. However, it will be understood that such connections may be done in a variety of ways known to the art including, but not limited to a bolt, a screw, pins, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, cam handle <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, also referred to as an actuating lever, is connected to an actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, is connected to an actuating lever <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. Actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is substantially disposed within first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is preferably placed such that it is substantially over the center of actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Preferably actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are connected such that cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> cannot move independently of actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also shows valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B in relation to actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A is shown operably connected to actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> while valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B is disposed in operative relation to the actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> effects motion in both valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B at substantially the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A is shown with second end <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> of driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> disposed through bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Preferably, in the resting position, second end <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> is substantially disposed within bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. However, it will be understood that second end <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> may be partly out of bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the present invention. The driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is sized to slidably pass through bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> without substantial obstruction from bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B are shown to be connected to valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A at attachment sites <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B. Bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and sites <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B are placed in a triangular configuration with sites <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B being placed substantially equidistant from bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Sites <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B are also placed substantially equidistant from actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> such that displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B are in substantial alignment with one another. Preferably the connections between displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B and connection sites <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B are pin connections such that the parts may be movably connected. However, it will be understood that the parts may be connected by known means in the art, such as, but not limited to, welding, bolting, and the like, without exceeding from scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, the operation of actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> will be discussed in detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows a side view of actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> at rest. Attachment site <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, cam arm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, and attachment site <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> create a joint <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Generally, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> operates as follows: the operator depresses the actuating lever <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and then the operator rotates actuating lever <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> which transmits a torque force (TF) through actuating arm <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (not shown). The torque force (TF) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> in the direction of the arrows. Such torque force (TF) rotates cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> which in turn rotates sites <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>B (not shown). Thus, driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, and displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B (not shown) will be in motion at substantially the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As cam handle <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> rotates, site <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> rotates in a downward direction forcing motion through cam arm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and, in turn, forcing driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> in a downward direction. Driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> passes through bore <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> such that second end <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> of the driver comes into contact with valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B. The downward motion of driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> pushes against valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B, which displaces valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B. The displacement of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B forces resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B in a biased position. In one embodiment, located substantially at the center of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B is a groove <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. The shape of groove <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> corresponds with the geometric shape of the end face of driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> such that driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> engages groove <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> At substantially the same time as site <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is in motion, sites <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>B are rotating in an upward direction, thus pulling displacement shafts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>B in an upward direction. This upward motion pulls at attachment sites <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B (not shown), which in turn pulls valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A upward, displacing valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A. The displacement of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A forces resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A in a biased position. Thus, at substantially the same time, valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B are displaced or opened to establish fluid communication between the valve gates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows a side view of the actuating mechanism in full operation (i.e., fully opened) with valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B being displaced or opened. Thus, at least indirectly, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> acts to open both valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B at substantially the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is in fully open, with valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> completely assembled, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> will lock into place automatically. This automatic locking feature is provided by the equilibrium of forces provided by the torque force (TF) and an equal and opposite retention force (RF) created by resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B. During actuation, cam arm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> acts to shift attachment site <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> from attachment site <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, such that the sites are offset from one another as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In other words, when actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is completely actuated, joint <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is in an overextended position. When actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is fully actuated, resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B is depressed in a biased position. The retention force (RF) created by biased resilient member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B acts upwardly through valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B to driver <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> to keep joint <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> locked in an overextended position. Once the retention force (RF) is applied, the torque force (TF) is no longer required and actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> will remain locked until the retention force (RF) is removed. Thus, the present invention provides for an automatic locking mechanism when the actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is fully opened and dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is fully assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has an automatic check valve feature (i.e., fail closed feature). When the sealing engagement between first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is broken, valve assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> automatically closes to prevent substantial leakage of fluid. As discussed above, valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B are maintained in the open position by applying a torque force (TF) and/or a retention force (RF). When actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is fully activated, and the torque force (TF) is removed, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> remains locked due to the retention force (RF) as discussed above. Releasing the retention force (RF) will cause actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> to automatically close. Essentially, if no torque force (TF) or retention force (RF) is applied, actuating mechanism <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is predisposed to spring back into its original position because resilient members <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>B are biased in the closed position, i.e., valve gates <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B close at substantially the same time. Release of the retention force (RF) may occur when first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is separated from sealing engagement with second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that separation of first housing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> from second housing portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may occur manually or automatically. Thus, the present invention provides for automatic checking of fluid flow whenever the valve assembly is disassembled, whether automatically or manually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> While, in the case of some embodiments disclosed herein, it is useful to provide a fluid system component, such as a dry break valve assembly, having mating halves, or portions, that can be readily engaged and disengaged under a variety of pressure conditions, it is useful in other situations to be able to prevent disengagement of the mating portions of the dry break valve when the pressure in the line wherein the dry break valve is employed has exceeded, or dropped below, as applicable, a predetermined level. With the foregoing in view, attention is directed now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> wherein various details are provided regarding aspects of an alternative embodiment of the dry break valve assembly, generally denoted at <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. As the operational and structural aspects of the illustrated embodiment are similar in many regards to those of other embodiments disclosed herein, the following discussion will focus primarily on selected aspects of the illustrated embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In particular, the dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> removably joined together by a coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. While, in the illustrated embodiment, coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is integral with first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> comprises a component discrete from both first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> in some alternative embodiments. Note that, as discussed elsewhere herein, the use of coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is not limited to dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to aspects of the first and second housing portions, the first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> each include a corresponding conduit connector <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>A, respectively, configured to attach to a fluid conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or other fluid system component, wherein such attachment may be accomplished in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, welding, brazing and soldering. Other exemplary types of conduit connectors <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>A that may be employed include compression fittings and threaded fittings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As indicated in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> each further include a corresponding flow control assembly <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>B, respectively, that are operated by way of an actuating mechanism (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and associated actuating lever <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, as described elsewhere herein. As discussed in further detail below, rotary motion for engaging and disengaging first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is imparted by way of handles <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> joined to coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In general, the engagement of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is achieved by way of mating pins and grooves, aspects of which are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. More specifically, coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> includes three engagement members, such as pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, spaced about its circumference and configured and arranged to engage second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. In an alternative embodiment discussed herein, pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are replaced with a plurality of rollers connected to coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The use of rollers in place of pins is useful, for example, where coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is relatively large, and significant frictional forces must otherwise be overcome to operate coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in the manner described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In correspondence with pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> includes three grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, each traversing an arc &bgr; of about one hundred twenty (120) degrees about the circumference of second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The width and depth of grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> generally correspond to the diameter and length, respectively, of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, each groove <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> includes three connected portions, or segments. Specifically, each groove <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> includes an entry segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>A, an intermediate segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B, and a terminal segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C. In some alternative embodiments, grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> are defined by a structure that is discrete from, but attached or attachable to, second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the terminal segment comprises a segment of a groove, other than the entry segment, that cooperates with a longitudinal axis such as axis AA (see, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>) to define an oblique angle. In yet other embodiments, the terminal segment may be generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis (see, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Moreover, the number and arrangement of intermediate segments in a groove, or grooves, may be varied as/if desired (see, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 12</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the foregoing configuration is exemplary only and aspects such as, but not limited to, the size, number, geometry, arrangement, offset angle &thgr; and arc length &bgr; (of grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>) and disposition of one or more of the embodiments of the pins and grooves disclosed herein, including pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, may be modified as necessary to suit the requirements of a particular application. Consistent with the foregoing, details concerning various alternative embodiments of grooves are set forth elsewhere herein (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Moreover, at least one embodiment of the invention includes four engagement members, examples of which include pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In general, the engagement of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is effected by positioning each pin <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> in a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and causing pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> to travel along grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, as suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. More particularly, first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> are brought together until each pin <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> of coupling <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is positioned in the entry segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>A of a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> of second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Rotation of second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is then initiated, by way of handles <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. As a result of the angular orientation of entry segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>A with respect to a longitudinal axis AA defined by the dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the initial rotation of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> causes second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> to be drawn toward first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Continued rotation of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> causes pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> to complete their traverse of corresponding entry segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>A, and move into their respective intermediate segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B. In at least some cases, pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> travel to the respective ends of intermediate segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B. In any event, pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> remain in intermediate segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B until such time as a predetermined pressure level is attained in a fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) collectively defined by first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 8</cross-reference>A, and directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, details are provided concerning various operational aspects of an exemplary embodiment of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. As suggested above, the engagement of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> results in the definition of a fluid passageway, generally denoted at <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and comprising portions <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Prior to commencement of a fluid transfer operation, fluid is introduced into portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A, for example, by way of a conduit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) connected to first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, thereby pressurizing portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A. The pressure thus exerted, denoted at P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in FIG. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, acts on the back of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A, which is in contact with sealing member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> attached to first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. As a result of this arrangement of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A, sealing member <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, and first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, the exertion of P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in this way causes first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to move slightly forward into closer engagement with second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> to lock up into corresponding terminal segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C of grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, as suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the forward motion of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may, depending on the position of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> prior to pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A, be accompanied by a rotary motion of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> as well, as pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> travel along intermediate segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B and come to rest in terminal segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C of groove <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. Further, one or both of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> may or may not rotate, depending upon whether one or both such portions <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> are otherwise restrained from rotational movement during the initial pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. In yet other embodiments, little or no rotation of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> or second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, rotary motion of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, at least, is facilitated, at least in part, by the geometric relation of intermediate segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B with terminal segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C, expressed as an offset angle &thgr;. Specifically, as the action of pressure P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on the back of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) causes first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to move forward into closer engagement with second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the geometry that defines offset angle &thgr; guides each pin <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> laterally, as well as forward, from the intermediate segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>B into its corresponding terminal segment <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Once pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are seated thus, the continuing exertion of pressure P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on the back of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A aids in the retention of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> in their corresponding terminal segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>) and resists motion of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> in the opposite direction, that is, out of their corresponding terminal segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C. As a result, first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> cannot be disengaged from each other until the fluid pressure in portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> has been reduced to a predetermined level or differential, or until the pressure in portions <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B has been equalized. Thus, the pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> cooperate with each other, and advantageously employ the line pressure, to ensure a secure connection between first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> under a variety of pressure conditions. Note that the arrangement and configuration of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> in this exemplary embodiment, and others disclosed herein, may be varied to function in concert with either positive or negative (vacuum) pressures in fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Note further that a variety of means may be profitably employed to perform the functions, disclosed herein, of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, and rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A and grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C discussed below. Examples of such functions include, but are not limited to, releasably engaging first and second elements of a fluid system component, maintaining engagement of such first and second elements so long as the line fluid pressure meets or exceeds a first predetermined value, and facilitating disengagement of such first and second elements when the line fluid pressure has reached a second predetermined value. Such first and second elements of a fluid system include, but are not limited to, first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> of cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Thus, pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, and rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A and grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C, respectively, comprise exemplary structures that function as a means for releasable engagement. It should be understood that such structures are presented solely by way of example and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> While, in the foregoing discussion, various operational aspects of an exemplary embodiment of dry break valve assembly <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> are considered in the situation wherein a fluid processing operation is initiated by pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, yet other fluid processing operations are commenced by initially pressurizing portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. As discussed below however, pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> provide comparable functionality regardless of which portion of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is initially pressurized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In particular, fluid introduced into portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> prior to commencement of a fluid transfer operation serves to pressurized portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B. The pressure thus exerted, denoted at P<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, acts on the back of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B, which is in contact with sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> attached to second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. As a result of this arrangement of valve gate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>B, sealing member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the exertion of P<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in this way causes second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> to move slightly forward into closer engagement with first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing terminal segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C of grooves <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> into engagement with corresponding pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, as suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Similar to the case where portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A is initially pressurized, the pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B may, depending on the position of pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and terminal segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C prior to such pressurization, be accompanied by a rotary motion of second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> as well, as terminal segments <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>C of groove <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> travel into a position where they can engage corresponding pins <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. Of course, one or both of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> may or may not rotate, depending upon whether one or both such portions <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> are otherwise restrained from rotational movement during the initial pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. In any event, initial pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>B will operate, in substantially the same fashion as initial pressurization of portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>A, with respect to the engagement of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> with second housing portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> While the immediately preceding discussion is concerned with a specific type of fluid system component, that is, a dry break valve, embodiments of the invention are directed, more generally, to any fluid system component having portions, or elements, which are desired to be releasably engaged. One exemplary embodiment of such a fluid system component is considered below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 10</cross-reference>B, details are provided concerning an exemplary embodiment of a cap assembly, generally denoted at <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> generally includes a sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, configured to receive the end of a fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, a cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> configured to be positioned on the end of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> and cooperating with fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> to at least partially define a fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> when so positioned, and a collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> generally configured to retain cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> More particularly, sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> defines a socket <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>A having an inside diameter of dimension ID compatible with the outside diameter dimension OD of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. It is desirable in some cases to construct sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> in such a way that a gap is introduced between the inside of socket <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>A and fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> so as to accommodate, for example, any differences in the thermal expansion rates of sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may be attached to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner, such as by methods including, but not limited to, welding, brazing and soldering. In at least one embodiment, sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> each include mating threads so that sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> can be removably attached to fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Generally, sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> comprises a metallic material that, in at least some instances, is chemically and thermally compatible with fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Exemplary materials for sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> include, but are not limited to, copper and its alloys, steels, iron, aluminum and its alloys, and titanium and its alloys. Moreover, sleeve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be machined or cast. Other suitable construction methods may alternatively be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to its various geometric features, sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> further includes a substantially annular chamfer <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>B that defines an opening wherein a portion of cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> is received, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. Generally, the geometry of chamfer <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>B is configured to correspond to the structure of cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> with which it interfaces. Geometric aspects of chamfer <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>B such as, but not limited to, the wall thickness and chamfer angle may be adjusted as necessary to suit the requirements of a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As further indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> defines a plurality of grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C that are configured and arranged to engage corresponding structure of coupling <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, discussed in further detail below. In particular, and directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> as well, each groove <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C includes three connected segments, an entry segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>D, an intermediate segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>E, and a terminal segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>F. Such grooves may be machined, or otherwise formed, in the outer surface of sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and, in one embodiment, each describes an arc &bgr; of about one hundred twenty (120) degrees about the circumference of sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. In the case of other exemplary embodiments, such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> for example, arc &bgr; described by each groove may be such that the grooves overlap each other. Similar to other exemplary embodiments of grooves disclosed herein, intermediate segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>E and terminal segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>F cooperate to define an offset angle &dgr; that aids in the engagement of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> with sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> generally in the manner described elsewhere herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the embodiment of grooves <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>C illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> is exemplary only and aspects of grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C such as, but not limited to, the size, number, geometry, arrangement, arc length &bgr;, offset angle &dgr;, and disposition of one or more of grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C may be varied in accordance with the requirements of a particular application. Accordingly, such exemplary embodiment should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In correspondence with the grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C defined by sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A, each of which is configured and arranged to be received within a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C and to travel therealong, as suggested by the exemplary roller travel paths illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. To that end, each roller <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A has a diameter and thickness that generally correspond with the width and depth, respectively, of a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A are disposed within the interior of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and are each attached to a corresponding fastener <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>B that passes through collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Each of the fasteners <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>B is secured in position by a corresponding nut <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>C, and the extent to which rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A protrude into the interior of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> may be changed by adjusting the positioning of nuts <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>C accordingly. In some embodiments of the invention, bearings or similar structures or devices are provided to facilitate ready and reliable rotation of the rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> With continuing attention to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, further details are provided concerning aspects of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. In particular, collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> defines a sealing surface <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>D that cooperates with O-ring <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> to substantially prevent fluid leakage from the joint cooperatively defined by cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, as well as from the joint cooperatively defined by cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. As suggested by the foregoing, and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the exemplary embodiment of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is substantially hollow and is configured to receive cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> in such a way as to substantially prevent material axial or radial movement of cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> when collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> has fully engaged sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> comprise discrete structures. However, in an alternative embodiment, cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> are integral with each other, or otherwise permanently joined to each other, and an O-ring or other sealing device is interposed between cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. The foregoing arrangements are exemplary only however, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 10</cross-reference>B, and directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</cross-reference>, cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> further includes one or more handles <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> that permit a user to impart a rotary motion so as to engage (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>), or disengage (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>), collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. The handles <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>E may comprise steel bar stock or any other suitable materials and/or configurations. In at least one embodiment, aspects of which are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>C, each of handles <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> are rotatably attached, by way of pins <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, to corresponding blocks <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> joined to collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> so that handles <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> can be rotated, as indicated, from a use position upward into a storage position when not needed, and vice versa. Moreover, some embodiments include one or more stops <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> which serve to prevent over-rotation of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, stops <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> comprise bolts that pass through collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. However, any other suitable arrangement or structure providing similar functionality may alternatively be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As further indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A, 11A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B, cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> further includes an alignment tab <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, which is attached to sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and/or fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, or otherwise suitably located. In the illustrated embodiment, alignment tab <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> defines an opening <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>A positioned to be aligned with a corresponding opening <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> defined by one of the fasteners <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. At such time as an opening <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is substantially aligned with opening <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>A in a way that corresponds to a desired position of handles <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, a tamper-evident device <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight> comprising, for example, a thin wire <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight>A that can be threaded through the aligned holes and securely fastened with a lead seal <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight>B so that an observer can readily determine if the position of handles <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> has been changed subsequent to placement of the tamper-evident device <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Moreover, and as suggested above, alignment tab <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> is positioned so as to provide feedback to the operator as to whether or not collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> are fully engaged with each other. In particular, and as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is initially positioned so that a fastener <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is disposed on either side thereof. As collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is rotated to the fully engaged position, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, the hole <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>A of alignment tab <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> is aligned with a corresponding hole <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a fastener <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>B. Consequently, an operator can readily make a visual determination as to whether or not collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> are fully engaged with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> additionally includes a safety restraint <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> comprising a cable <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>A and cable crimps <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>B. In an exemplary embodiment, cable <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>A comprises a one eighth (0.125) inch diameter steel cable looped through at least one handle <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> and around fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, and retained in place by cable crimps <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>B, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. Generally, safety restraint <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> operates as a redundant safety system that serves to prevent, or reduce, damage to personnel or surrounding equipment and systems in the event collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> becomes disconnected, in an uncontrolled manner, from sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> With attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 11</cross-reference>C, details are provided concerning various operational aspects of the illustrated embodiment. As such operational aspects are similar in many regard to those discussed elsewhere herein with respect to various alternative embodiments, the following discussion will focus primarily on selected operational aspects of the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 11</cross-reference>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In operation, the engagement of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is effected by positioning each roller <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A in a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C and causing rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A to travel along grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C according to the path denoted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. More particularly, collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> are brought together until each roller <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is positioned in the entry segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>D of a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C of sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. Rotation of collar <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>06</bold></highlight> is then initiated by way of handles <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>. As a result of the angular orientation of entry segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>D with respect to a longitudinal axis BB defined by the cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the initial rotation of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> causes collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> to be drawn toward sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, confining cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Continued rotation of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> causes rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A to complete their traverse of corresponding entry segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>D, and move into their respective intermediate segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>E. In at least some cases, rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A travel to the respective ends of terminal intermediate <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>E. In any event, rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A remain in intermediate segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>E until such time as a predetermined pressure level is attained in a fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>) collectively defined by cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, fluid is introduced into fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, by way of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>) connected with cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, thereby pressurizing portion fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. The pressure thus exerted, denoted at P<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, transmits a force to cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> which, in turn, transmits the force to collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the exertion of P<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in this way forces rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A, attached to collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, to lock up into corresponding terminal segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>F of grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C and remain therein, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the forward motion of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> may, depending on the position of rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A at the time of pressurization of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, be accompanied by a rotary motion of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> as well, as rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A travel along intermediate segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>E and come to rest in terminal segment <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>F of groove <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C. Generally, such rotary motion of collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is achieved in the substantially the same way as the rotary motion of first housing portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Once rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A are seated in their corresponding terminal segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>F of grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C, the continuing presence of pressure P<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>exerts a force on cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> that resists motion of rollers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>06</bold></highlight>A in the opposite direction, that is, out of their corresponding terminal segments <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>F, and thereby aids in the retention of rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A in such terminal segments. As a result, collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> of cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> cannot be disengaged from each other until the fluid pressure in fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> has been reduced to a predetermined level or differential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Thus, the rollers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>A and grooves <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>C cooperate with each other, and advantageously employ the line pressure, to ensure a secure connection between collar <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> of cap assembly <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> subsequent to pressurization of fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Thus, the likelihood of inadvertent, or intentional, removal of cap <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> while a potentially dangerous level of pressure exists in fluid passageway <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, is materially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Directing attention now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, details are provided concerning an alternative embodiment of a groove arrangement including a plurality of grooves generally denoted at <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. Note that in the interest of clarity, the generally cylindrical structural element wherein the grooves <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> are formed is shown flat, rather than in a perspective view. Similar to other embodiments of grooves disclosed herein, groove <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of segments, including an entry segment <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>A. In contrast with such other embodiments however, groove <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> further includes four intermediate segments denoted, respectively, <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>E as well as a terminal segment <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>F. Moreover, in embodiments of the invention employing configurations such as grooves <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, the final resting position of the associated rollers (not shown), that is, after the associated fluid passageway has been pressurized, is in terminal segment <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>F, rather than in one of the intermediate segments <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Although in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, grooves <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> are illustrated that include four intermediate segments, one or more aspects of grooves <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> may be varied as necessary to suit a particular application. For example, intermediate segments <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>F are, in some embodiments, generally parallel to each other. In yet other embodiments, such intermediate segments are disposed in a non-parallel arrangement. The same is likewise true with respect to segments <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>E. Moreover, other features such as, but not limited to, the length, width and depth of one or more grooves <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> may be modified as required/desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It should thus be noted that the foregoing, and other, arrangements of grooves, as well as the type and arrangement of their associated engagement members, disclosed herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. By way of example, in another exemplary embodiment (not shown), one or more of such grooves substantially describes a &ldquo;J&rdquo; shape, such that line pressure causes the corresponding engagement member to lock into a location proximate the end of the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; portion of the &ldquo;J&rdquo; shaped groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as exemplary and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. </paragraph>
