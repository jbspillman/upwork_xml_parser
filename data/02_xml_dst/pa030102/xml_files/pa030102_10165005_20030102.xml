<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Hardware designed to improve safety and minimize the risk involved in installing, maintaining, and operating sectional doors that use springs to facilitate door movement. A lock-on side bearing bracket bears up a spring on a garage door. This side-bearing bracket includes a hook and a perpendicular tab to prevent the spring from dangerously releasing its energy when parts supporting the spring are removed or fail. A lock-on bottom roller bracket having a bottom bearing plate and a safety hook similarly prevents a potential release of energy when the garage door lift cable is tensed. A curled portion at the bottom of the lift cable prevents the cable from coming off the drum. A safety latch with a latch bar and a latch cover acts as a lock for the garage door. Multiple safety features make the garage door systems of the present invention particularly safe to operate and maintain. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of sectional doors and related safety devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel hardware devices designed to improve safety and minimize the risk involved in installing, maintaining and operating sectional doors which utilize spring mechanisms to facilitate door movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Large doorways in garages, shops, stores, warehouses and other buildings often use sectional doors to enclose the doorway opening. These doors are generally constructed of wood or metal panels which are joined by metal hinges and hung from metal rollers which travel along a fixed track at each side of the door. Sectional doors typically range in size from small storage unit models of just a few feet wide to very large models which accommodate trucks and heavy equipment. Sectional doors are used for residential garages where they are found in one and two car sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The size of sectional doors and the weight of their materials make them relatively heavy and, therefore, difficult to lift. Many doors also contain insulation and other materials which further add to the door&apos;s weight. Even an average-sized residential garage door can weigh several hundred pounds, making it impossible for the average person to lift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a consequence of the weight of sectional doors, mechanisms have been invented to counteract the door&apos;s weight thereby allowing manual operation of the door. One common method of counteracting a door&apos;s weight is accomplished with a counterspring mechanism using springs which are displaced elastically as the door is shut, thereby exerting a lifting force on the door as it is closed. This spring force slows the fall of the door during closing and aids significantly in lifting the door; in effect, the door weight is balanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Coil springs, in a torsion spring configuration, are often used for these mechanisms. In a torsion spring configuration, the coil spring is deflected or wound around the axis of its helix. In a typical coil spring configuration, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one or more coil springs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are wound around a shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> near the top of the door <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. One end of each coil spring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to a mounting bracket <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is connected by screws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the building structure which is typically a wooden beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> across the door opening. The other end of the spring is attached to a cable drum pulley <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> around which a cable <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is wound. The cable <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends to the bottom of the door where it is attached with a bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. These coil springs are pre-wound or pre-tensioned to increase lifting potential and ensure that the door is lifted to a fully opened position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As the door closes, the cable unwinds from the cable drum pulley thereby twisting the spring and increasing the torsion on the spring and the energy stored within the spring. A properly adjusted spring mechanism will exert a force on a door that is about the same as the weight of the door allowing a user to open the door with the slightest of lifting effort. This means that the ideal spring mechanism, on an average door, will need to store an amount of energy that is approximately equal to the weight of the door. In terms of force and considering the lever arm of the cable drum, the spring holds a force of at least twice the weight of the door. Consequently, these spring mechanisms store a great deal of energy that is unleashed as a twisting force. Under proper operating conditions, this mechanism results in a smoothly operating door, but when poorly or improperly maintained or installed this force can be instantly unleashed in an injurious and even deadly fury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One problem area where serious injuries can occur is at the location where the spring mounting bracket <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> attaches to the building. The spring mounting bracket is usually attached to a wood header or beam spanning across the doorway opening or vertical wood stud members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These beams, headers or studs are typically wood members that sometimes have a relatively high moisture content at the time of construction. Over time the wood loses its natural moisture, causing shrinkage, warping or bowing of the framing members as the shrinkage pattern encounters natural inconsistencies in the grain of the wood. Cracking also results from this natural moisture loss leaving large voids in what was once solid lumber. As a result of this drying process, holes drilled for screws and mounting hardware may expand, crack and otherwise deform leaving the screws or other connectors loose and structurally weakened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The connection to the wood support is typically made with lag screws which penetrate holes in the bracket and thread into drilled holes in the wood. This type of connection generally appears structurally sound over the short term, but problems may arise with wood shrinkage and installation problems. As the wood shrinks, the screw holes expand and the grip on the screw threads decreases and fails. Problems may also arise from installation error or misjudgment. Holes for lag screws should be drilled to an exact size to provide optimal screw capacity. When holes are over-bored to a diameter that is larger than the optimal size for the screw, the screw&apos;s holding capacity is greatly diminished. Similarly, a hole may be drilled too small or not at all which may cause the wood to crack when the lag screw is installed or a screw is inserted. Likewise, a lag screw or other fastener maybe over-tightened, causing the screw thread to twist within the hole, thereby removing some of the wood material within the hole and effectively stripping the hole interior. This also weakens the screw&apos;s holding capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Often, siding material is applied to the interior face of the doorway structure to which the spring mounting bracket is attached. Generally, this siding is a gypsum-based &ldquo;drywall&rdquo; or &ldquo;sheetrock&rdquo; material that provides fire-proofing and aesthetic benefits but has very little structural strength. Screws and other fasteners which must penetrate this layer have considerably lower holding capacity due to the decreased fastener penetration into the sound structural wood below. Sometimes a piece of 2&times;4 or 2&times;6 is nailed through the sheetrock to the structure below, to which the spring mounting brackets are fastened. In this situation, the spring&apos;s torsional force is now contained only by the nails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The problem is exacerbated by the repetitive vibration the connection must endure. The vibration and stress caused by the repeated opening and closing of the door, especially when performed by high-speed electric openers, can be an additional and significant factor in connection failure. Screw connections that are already weakened by the above-mentioned factors can vibrate loose and screws can even wiggle right out of their holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When the mounting bracket connection fails, the entirety of the stored torsional energy of the door spring is instantaneously unleashed, typically through uncontrolled, high-velocity spinning of the sharp-edged metal mounting bracket. When this failure occurs, any person or thing in close proximity to the bracket will be injured or destroyed. The energy of the spring mechanism is sufficient to cause severe injury and can easily maim, dismember or kill a person who is near the unit at the time of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A dangerous situation often presents itself when an unwary homeowner or repairman observes loose or missing fasteners on the spring mounting bracket. Generally, the observer&apos;s reaction is to tighten the loose fasteners. This typically requires the &ldquo;repairman&rdquo; to climb a ladder, putting himself in very close proximity to the spring mounting bracket while tightening the loose fastener with a wrench. If the holes have expanded due to drying or have been stripped out or otherwise weakened, the attempted &ldquo;tightening&rdquo; will generally cause further weakening of the connection which is under spring force load often causing complete connector failure. When complete connector failure occurs, the spring force is instantly released by the wildly spinning mounting bracket immediately adjacent to the unwary, surprised and potentially badly injured &ldquo;repairman.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another safety problem occurs at the location where the cable <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> attaches to the door. This connection is typically made with a bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is attached to the door with sheet metal screws. Like the rest of the spring mechanism, an enormous amount of energy is stored in the connection between the cable and the door. While this connection is not as prone to failure from wood deterioration or installer error, it can fail as a consequence of fatigue, improper installation, collision damage or corrosion. Common sheet metal screws are typically installed with power tools which can over-tighten and strip the metal parts they connect, leaving a weakened connection. Fatigue due to repeated stress cycles as the door opens and closes also takes a toll on the connection, especially with light gauge materials. Even when the connection is not seriously compromised, for example, in a light collision which slightly bends or breaks a bracket, an observer will have a desire to replace the damaged part, thereby exposing himself to danger. Most commonly, this danger presents itself when untrained repairmen or unsuspecting homeowners try to adjust or disconnect any part of the lift cable, bottom bracket or spring mechanism. When the majority of the cable bracket screws are removed, the lift cable can instantly fly from the door, slicing or shredding most objects in its path. Again, the full energy required to lift the heavy door around above the opening is instantly unleashed with the potential to maim or kill. Typical lift cable brackets are stamped light-gauge metal with sharp edges, further increasing the hazard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Set screws on the spring fixtures, such as winding and stationary cones, can also be inadvertently released by a repairman or unsuspecting home owner, resulting in a similar instantaneous release of the dangerous spring energy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention reduces or eliminates the safety hazards of the prior art through the use of side mounted springs attached to lock-on side bearing brackets, tamper-resistant set screws and fasteners and lock-on bottom roller brackets which attach the lift cable to the door frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The problematic connection of the prior art between the mounting bracket and the building structure is eliminated by moving the coil springs to the sides of the torsion shaft above the door and attaching the springs to a bracket which is bolted to the metal track structure of the door. The track structure is screwed into the building framework, but through a much more expansive connection which avoids the concentrated, high-stress, high-torsion connection of the prior art. The preferred embodiments of the present invention incorporate multiple safety features that serve as additional safety back-ups for the systems of the present invention. Among these redundant safety features is a lock-on side bearing bracket with an inventive locking device that prevents the spring mechanism from releasing its energy even when the track and spring mechanism are entirely disconnected from the wall. Additionally, the spring mechanism energy will be retained even when the bolts holding the lock-on bearing bracket are removed. This redundant safety feature is accomplished by the use of a novel lock-on hook device which is an integral part of the bearing bracket. Many prior art side-mounted springs totally ignore safety concerns. Many of them utilize very dangerous outside lift cables which can entrap and strangle children playing with the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention also eliminates the dangerous and problematic connection between the spring mechanism cable and the sectional door. This problem is eliminated by the use of a lock-on bottom roller bracket which is attached to the door frame with screws in a conventional manner, but which also incorporates redundant safety features. One safety feature is a lock-on bracket mechanism which hooks below the door frame, but which does not lock onto the door frame unless the attachment screws are removed or fail while tension is on the lift cable. Another safety feature is a curl located at the bottom of the lift cable which prevents the lift cable from straightening and coming off the cable drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The lock-on bottom roller bracket comprises a lift cable connection which uses a cable loop and clevis pin assembly. Additionally, the lock-on bottom roller bracket comprises a hook device which wraps around the bottom of the door frame and with the slightest movement prevents the bracket from being removed from the door frame while there is tension on the lift cable. The lock-on feature fastens solid only when the screws are removed while there is tension on the lift cable. The lock-on hook is designed to be free from the vertical part of the door frame unless the fasteners are removed while there is tension on the lift cable. At that point, the bottom lock-on roller bracket locks on. Further, the lock-on bottom roller bracket comprises a bottom plate which attaches below the door frame, thereby strengthening the attachment to the door and helping to prevent the bracket from instantaneously separating from the door in the case of conventional fastener failure or removal. The lock-on bottom roller bracket is designed for safer interior lift cables and may not be used as an option for dangerous outside lift cables used in some prior art designs. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The figures listed above are expressly incorporated as part of this detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and apparatus of the present invention, as represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 8</cross-reference>, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed, but is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The presently disclosed embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;conventional fasteners&rdquo; as used in this document refers to fasteners for connecting metal, wood, plastic and other materials common in sectional door construction. By way of example and not limitation, these fasteners comprise screws, bolts, nuts, washers, rivets, cotter pins, clevis pins, studs, threaded rods and other mechanical fasteners as well as adhesives such as epoxy, welding joints such as spot welds and conventional fillet and butt joint welds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A non-fastener structure is a device that does not hold the items of its connection in a fixed physical relationship without other support, force or torque. A non-limiting example of a non-fastener structure is a hook, such as a hook which engages an element but only remains in contact with that element while a force acts on the hook, pulling it against the element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;torsion spring&rdquo; or &ldquo;torsional spring&rdquo; is an element which is elastically deformed by a torque or rotational force and which counteracts against that torque with an equal, but opposite, torque. The torsion spring may provide the counteracting torque directly by virtue of its shape and configuration or it may counteract the torque indirectly through a mechanism which converts spring force into torque. By way of non-limiting example, a torsion spring may be a helically wound coil spring which is elastically deformed by a rotational motion about its helical axis, a torsion bar or a leaf spring connected to a lever and gear mechanism which creates torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;static structure&rdquo; shall refer to any structure that is substantially static or immovable in response to the forces exerted by a typical sectional door. Examples of static structures, given by way of example and not limitation, are residential or commercial building frames including framing elements such as studs, posts, columns, beams, headers, lintels, stem walls, foundation structures and other elements that are assembled into a building frame. Other non-limiting examples of static structures are posts, fences, retaining walls and garden walls. These elements may be constructed of concrete, masonry, lumber, steel, plastic, fiberglass, aluminum or other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;counter-spring&rdquo; shall refer to any type of mechanism which uses elastic deformation of an element&apos;s shape to counteract a force or weight. By way of example and not limitation, a counter-spring may take the form of a coil spring from which an object is suspended or which stretches along its helical axis to support the weight of an object, thereby allowing the object to be lifted more easily. Also, by way of non-limiting example, a coil spring may be connected coaxially, in a torsion spring configuration, to a pulley or drum so that the spring rotates with the pulley or drum such that a cable wound around the pulley or drum from which an object is suspended would exert a counter-force against gravity, thereby allowing the object to be lifted with a force lesser than the weight of the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A specific embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, comprises novel safety features for use with a spring-based system of pivotally connected sectional doors. This inventive system utilizes a torsion assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is connected by cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to sectional door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The roll-up door rides on rollers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which engage and travel within tracks <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at each side of the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. These tracks typically comprise a vertical track <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, an arcuate track <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and a horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Vertical track <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is substantially parallel to door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in its closed position. Vertical track <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is attached to wall structure <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with a metal vertical track angle, also called a reverse angle shield <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and bracket material using conventional fasteners such as screws, bolts, and rivets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is typically attached at its end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to a building ceiling structure <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> using metal angle and bracket material and conventional fasteners. Horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is typically also attached to horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which connects with vertical track angle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> near wall structure <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the arcuate track <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and the vertical track <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are attached to the vertical track angle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through a connecting bracket <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> using conventional fasteners and may optionally be attached directly to the building structure. The horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the arcuate track <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the vertical track <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the vertical track angle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are all part of what is herein referred to as a &ldquo;support track&rdquo; for the sectional door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Torsion assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, comprises a torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which spans between novel lock-on side bearing brackets <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which contain bearings <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that support torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and allow torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to rotate freely. While torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extends the entire width of the doorway, torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may have one or more sections that are connected in a manner that will allow torque to be transmitted between each section. Torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may also be supported by intermediate bearing brackets <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which contain bearings and allow torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to rotate freely within the bracket bearing. Torsion assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is generally located adjacent to the wall and immediately above the doorway as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, or to the rear of the horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Lock-on side bearing brackets <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may attach to horizontal track angles <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> with conventional fasteners <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Lock-on side bearing brackets <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may also be attached to the wall structure <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with conventional fasteners <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> such as lag screws. However, these conventional connections may fail due to the above described problems or may be inadvertently removed by an unwary and untrained &ldquo;repairman.&rdquo; Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, an inventive lock-on safety hook element <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and a shelf or torque tab <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> on the lock-on side bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> prevent the lock-on side bearing brackets <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from breaking free and spinning dangerously when the conventional fasteners are removed or fail. Note that the safety hook <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and tab <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> are shaped to fit the contour of the adjacent horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Lock-on safety hook <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> hooks under horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and torque tab <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> bears on the top of horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from rotating against the hook. As door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> closes, lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> unwinds from cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, thereby rotating cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which causes torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to rotate, which, in turn, rotates winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> whose rotatable free end is free to rotate against the force of the spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Spring anchor cone <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> holds the fixed end of spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in a static position so that rotation of spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> will cause increased torsional force and increased stored energy in spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As spring anchor cone <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached to lock-on side bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> through spring anchor bracket <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, lock-on side bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> must resist the full torsional force of the spring when the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is closed. This torque is transmitted to the static structure of the building through lock-on side bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and reverse angle shield <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. If the conventional fasteners of the lock-on side bearing bracket are removed or fail, lock-on safety hook <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> bears up against the bottom of horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> while torque tab <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> bears down on the top of horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, thereby transmitting the full torque of spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which is directly and securely attached to the static structure of the building <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, through the full length of the vertical reverse angle shield <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the extremely high energy stored in the spring will not be inadvertently released and the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> bracket will not spin dangerously upon anyone because the hook <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and tab <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> structure will prevent this from occurring even when conventional fasteners are removed or fail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Spring winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> circumscribes torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and selectively locks against torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to prevent rotation so that spring winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> maybe rotated to pre-tension spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and may thereafter be locked against rotation so as to maintain the pre-tension force. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, this rotational lock is a hardened, tamper-resistant steel set screw with a red safety warning cap. Coil spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> connects to winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the inner end of spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with a torsionally rigid connection such that when winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is rotated, torsion in spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> will increase or decrease depending on the direction of rotation. Spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is also torsionally rigidly attached, at its outer end, to anchor cone <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is bolted to anchor bracket <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which bends around cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and attaches to lock-on side bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Once installed, the outer end of spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> remains rotationally fixed to anchor bracket <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and lock-on side bearing bracket <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> because lock-on side bearing bracket is redundantly attached to horizontal track angle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is torsionally rigidly attached to torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> winds around cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, lift cables <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are attached, at their lower end, to door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, near the bottom of each side of door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, with lock-on bottom roller brackets <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which attach to bottom door frame members <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> with conventional fasteners as well as with an inventive safety hook <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. A bottom plate <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> further increases safety by providing a bearing surface which bears against the bottom of the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, thereby decreasing stress on the conventional fasteners and providing another redundant mechanism for preventing dangerous separation of the lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached to lock-on bottom roller bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by a cable loop <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which receives clevis pin <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, penetrates bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and is secured by cotter pin <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, lock-on bottom roller bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comprises safety hook <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which is configured so as to engage an element <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in such a way that bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will not separate from door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or door element <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> while lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is tensioned. While door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in a closed position, lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially vertically oriented so that cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> exerts a vertical force on bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, thereby pulling bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> toward door member <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, and, if fasteners are removed, engaging safety hook <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> against door element <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. Door element <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> may be shaped with notch <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> so as to better engage hook <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Because of the vertical force on brackets <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the safety hook <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> will fully engage when there is inadvertent tampering or failure of fasteners <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises bottom plate <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> on lock-on bottom roller bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Bottom plate <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> bears on the bottom of door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and preferably on the bottom of door member <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, allowing a contact area between bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which will help prevent bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> from separating from door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the event that the conventional fasteners therein fail or are removed. As shown at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably has a curled portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which prevents the cable from straightening and coming off the drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the event, for example, that either the left or right side of the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> becomes jammed or suffers an impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in an open position with its rollers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> resting in horizontal track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, a substantial portion of lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is wound around cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> exerts a light &ldquo;pre-tensioned&rdquo; torsional force on cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which puts tension on lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby holding door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the upright and open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is lowered toward a closed position, lift cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pulled downward, thereby rotating cable drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is rigidly fixed to torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This action rotates torsion shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which rotates winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is rigidly attached to spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, causing spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to rotate and increase the torsional force and energy stored therein. Subsequently, as the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is lifted, spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is unwound, thereby releasing energy and helping lift the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by counteracting the force of gravity on the door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of a safety latch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> contemplated within the present invention. Latch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which serves as a door lock on the entire door system, includes a lock support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a latch bar <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a latch aperture <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which is placed in rail <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and can include other knockout apertures <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as well. Lock support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> mounts to the edge of door member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with either screws or bolts, or other appropriate fastening means. Latch bar <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is part of lock support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and slides in a manner to engage latch aperture <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Latch aperture <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> further includes a latch aperture shield <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which is mounted in a hinged manner to support rail <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and covers aperture <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> when latch bar <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is disengaged. Latch aperture shield <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> prevents items from being trapped within aperture <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during opening or closing of the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a close-up perspective view of drum <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which mounts to rod <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Drum <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes at least one retaining screw <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which inserts through retaining aperture <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Each retaining screw <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> engages rod <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to prevent drum <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from rotating independently about the rod. Also, the retaining screws <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> allow drum <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be removably mounted to the rod for easy repairs and installation when necessary. A similar set of retaining screws <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are used with winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The retaining screws <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> fit through another aperture to engage with rod <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This allows the winding cone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be secured between turns during installation. Also, it allows for the cone to be securely fixed to the rod for operation. Additionally, each screw <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown to be a hex-driven screw. Accordingly, hex caps <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> can be placed within the hex opening of each screw <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
