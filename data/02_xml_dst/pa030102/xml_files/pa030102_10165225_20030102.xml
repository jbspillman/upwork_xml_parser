<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a mechanical joint, and, more particularly to an improved angle bracket for joining a pair of structural components, e.g., panels used in the construction of various items of furniture including, e.g., tables, chairs, shelving, and cabinets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, mechanical joints are widely used to construct items of furniture formed, at least in part, from abutting structural components. Such items of furniture, include, e.g., tables, chairs, shelving units, and cabinets. Many different types of fasteners are commonly used in constructions where abutting structural components are secured to one another. For example, L-shaped brackets, wooden cleats, mortise and tenon combinations, and dowel pins can be utilized to affix abutting components used to form items of furniture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One example of a fastener used to secure abutting structural components of, e.g., a cabinet or table is an elongated, metal L-shaped bracket. These fasteners are designed to rest atop and be affixed to the outer surfaces of abutting components. A plurality of apertures are drilled through each leg of the L-shaped bracket through which fasteners, such as screws, are placed. In use, a first leg of the bracket is fixed to a first one of the structural components, the second of the structural components is positioned adjacent to the first component, and the second leg of the bracket is fixed to the second structural component. This type of fastener can be relatively large. The size and the orientation (i.e., with each leg exposed and resting atop a structural component) of these brackets makes them visible and, therefore, not aesthetically pleasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other mechanical joints used in the construction of furniture, and, particularly, shelving include wooden cleats. Wooden cleats typically comprise an elongate piece of wood having a square or rectangular cross section. In use, the cleat is placed in the joint formed by adjacent structural components and is affixed to each of the structural components. A plurality of fasteners are utilized to secure the wooden cleat to the first component. The second component (commonly a shelf) is positioned atop the wooden cleat. Fasteners can be utilized to secure the second structural component in position atop the wooden cleat. These types of joints are most often used when supporting a shelf, however, they may be used in the construction of other items of furniture including chairs and tables. These types of mechanical joints are relatively large in size, and are entirely exposed in use, and, therefore, are not aesthetically pleasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additional forms of mechanical joints utilized in the construction of items of furniture include tongue and groove joints as well as mortise and tenon combinations. A tongue and groove joint includes one structural component having a groove and a second structural component having a tongue extending a similar length as the groove. The tongue is of similar shape to that of the groove and is interference fit therein to effect affixation of the components. Similar to the tongue and groove joint is a mortise and tenon combination. A mortise, which is a rectangular aperture, is provided in one component, while a tenon, which is a rectangular projection, is provided on the second component. The tenon is interference fit into the mortise to provide a secure link between the components. Both tongue and groove, and mortise and tenon joints require significant, and somewhat difficult machining producing tight tolerances to enable a good interference fit. The complicated machining of these types of fasteners increases both the time and expense of manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another fastener used in the construction of furniture is a dowel pin. A plurality of apertures are drilled into each structural component to be secured, so that the apertures in one component align with the apertures in the second component. The tolerance of both the size and the spacing of the apertures must be extremely tight so that the dowel pins may be interference fit into the apertures and so that the mating apertures will properly align. The exacting machining required by dowel pins increases both the time and cost of manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is desired to provide a mechanical joint for use in furniture which is simple, durable, relatively low in cost, substantially hidden in use, and universal in application. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an angle bracket connector for use in joining a pair of structural components used, e.g., to construct furniture components. The bracket has two legs, one for engaging each of the components to be joined. In one exemplary embodiment, one leg is longer than the other. In another exemplary embodiment, one leg has a rounded end, while the other leg has a square end. In certain embodiments, both ends of the angle bracket have rounded ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, a recess is formed in one of the structural components, and is sized to accommodate a leg of the bracket. In one exemplary embodiment, the geometries of the recess and the bracket itself cooperate to prevent rotation of the bracket. In use, one leg of the bracket is positioned in the recess, with the other leg protruding therefrom for support of the second structural component. The recess is positioned such that when the structural components are placed in abutting relationship, the recess, and, thus, the leg positioned therein, is hidden from view by the end of the second structural component. For the purposes of this document, &ldquo;abutting&rdquo; is meant to encompass situations in which the components are actually touching as well as situations where the components are in close proximity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary embodiment, a leg of the bracket is secured to a face of one of the structural components. In this embodiment, the second structural component includes a recess sized to accommodate the leg of the angle bracket secured to the first structural component. In use, the second structural component is positioned such that when the structural components are placed in abutting relationship, the recess accommodates the leg of the angle bracket connector secured to the first structural component. In this way, the second structural component removes from view the leg of the angle bracket connector secured to the first structural component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention, in one form thereof, comprises a mechanical joint including a first structural component having a face, a bracket having a pair of legs, with a first one of the legs of the bracket secured to the face of the first structural component, and a second structural component having an end and a face, with the face of the second structural component including a face bore formed therein, and the end of the second structural component abutting the face of the first structural component, with the face bore receiving the first leg of the bracket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention, in another form thereof, comprises an item of furniture having a mechanical joint affixing abutting structural components. The item of furniture of this form of the present invention comprises a first structural component and a second structural component, with the second structural component having an end abutting a face of the first structural component; and a bracket having a pair of legs disposed at an angle to each other, the bracket joining the first and the second structural components, a first one of the legs of the bracket disposed between the end of the second structural component and the face of the first structural component, the first one of the legs of the bracket is affixed to the face of the first structural component and the second structural component has a face including a face bore intersecting the end of the second structural component and receiving the first leg of the bracket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention, in a further form thereof, comprises a method of constructing an item of furniture. The method of this form of the current invention includes the steps of: providing a first structural component and a second structural component, the first structural component having a face, the second structural component having a face and an end; providing a bracket having a first leg and a second leg; securing the first leg to the face of the first structural component; forming a face bore in the face of the second structural component; and abutting the end of the second structural component with the face of the first structural component such that the first leg of the bracket is contained within the face bore and the second structural component rests atop the second leg of the bracket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that the bracket is substantially hidden from view and yet is relatively strong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that it is simple in construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is that it is universal in application in that it may be used in the construction of any type of structure having abutting components including, e.g., tables, chairs, shelving, and cabinets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is that it is relatively low in cost.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed from a plurality of structural components including panels such as end or side panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>), back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, can be, e.g., a television stand. Top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> share the same construction, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are designed to secure adjacent structural components to one another to construct furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Each end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fixed to back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are disposed between end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, being secured at each end to end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Furniture constructed utilizing the mechanical joint of the current invention can include many types of furnishing for a home or office, including, e.g., a desk, a bookcase, a television stand, cabinets, or the like. When constructing this type of furniture, structural components are placed in abutting relationship, with an end of one structural component, such as end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, abutting a surface of another structural component, such as surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The abutting relationship between structural components of furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allows at least a portion of brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be hidden from view as will be discussed herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as well as top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> include a plurality of recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are positioned along the edge of end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and, in use, align with a number of recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as well as a number of recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This allows one leg of brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be received in recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the second leg of brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be received in recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and top/bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, two different types of recesses (<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) are formed in the structural components, each type having a different shape. First recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is machined, e.g., into back component <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and includes rounded end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at one end intersecting side walls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending to the opposite end thereof. The end of recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> opposite rounded end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is open. Second recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has an oblong or generally elliptical shape. Second recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a pair of rounded ends <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, one at either end thereof, with side walls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are disposed in the structural components of furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in either a substantially vertical or a substantially horizontal orientation depending upon the orientation of the structural components to be joined thereto. For example, recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> along back side <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are disposed substantially vertically, while recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> positioned generally along the upper and lower edges of panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are disposed substantially horizontally. Generally, recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are oriented similar to the structural component to be affixed thereto via bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Since furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes only horizontally and vertically oriented structural components, only horizontally and vertically oriented recesses are required. In items of furniture having structural components oriented other than horizontally or vertically, recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> would be positioned accordingly. Recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are provided with pre-drilled apertures <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> for affixation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). In one exemplary, apertures <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are positioned slightly off center (on the order of 0.5 mm toward rounded end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) with respect to the mating recess in bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The off center position of apertures <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> draws the relevant structural components together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed such that abutting structural components are positioned with an end of a first structural component covering an oblong recess formed in a face of a second structural component. With particular reference to furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> abut end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> covers oblong recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> positioned along back side <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Similarly, ends <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> abut end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that top and bottom panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> cover oblong recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> positioned generally along the top and bottom edges of end panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, respectively. Recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are positioned on adjacent structural components so as to align with one another, allowing affixation of brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereto. Recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> have a depth allowing the structural components they are formed in to be placed in abutting relationship. For example, with bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed in recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> abuts end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to cover recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the leg of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contained in recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so that this leg of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is hidden from view. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed in surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which comprises the forward face of back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are thusly positioned for illustrative purposes only. In use, recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> could be formed in the back face (not shown) of back panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> would be entirely concealed from view. Recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is not essential for hiding the leg of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contained in recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and, therefore, may be excluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illustrated prior to affixation to end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is machined into end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and receives square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Similarly, recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is machined into panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for receiving rounded leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In use, square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is secured within oblong recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is thereafter positioned in abutting relationship to end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that rounded leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is received within recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In one exemplary embodiment, rounded leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is affixed to panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. It is further contemplated by the present invention to provide a bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for securing a generally horizontal structural component, wherein the rounded leg of the bracket is without an aperture to accommodate fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. When assembled, end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> covers oblong recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thus concealing square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from view. In use, rounded leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as well as surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> illustrate bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> secured to panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The current invention further contemplates a construction in which recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends into end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such that when bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed therein, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is flush with end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would be unnecessary. In such an embodiment, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> would be affixed to surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> being placed in abutting relationship with end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is received in recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is, in one exemplary embodiment, constructed from steel and includes legs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Generally, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed from material having sufficient strength to maintain the structural integrity of the furniture which it is used to form and to support the items which the furniture is made to support (e.g., a television on a television stand). Bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is L-shaped having square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> disposed approximately perpendicularly from rounded leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As indicated supra, both legs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be square, or round. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the angle &THgr; between legs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being approximately 90&deg;, however, &THgr; may be at any acute or obtuse angle necessary to position a pair of structural components as desired. As is known in the art, such a construction would require a mitered end on one of the structured components to be joined, so that the structural components could be placed in abutting relationship. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, legs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are each provided with aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through which fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), such as a screw or the like, may be placed. Chamfer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> accommodates the head of fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is flush with the leg of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which it is utilized to secure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, legs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shown disposed in recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. Recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is machined to substantially the same size and shape of leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed in oblong recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> such that each of the pair of oppositely disposed flat edges <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are parallel to side walls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so that rotation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is thereby limited. In one exemplary embodiment, recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is dimensioned such that square leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fits snugly between side walls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so that rotation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> about fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is prohibited. In alternative embodiments, the distance between side walls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will be such that slight rotation of leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be allowed. However, it is preferred that recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is constructed such that rotation of leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and consequently bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is substantially prohibited. Recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is machined to have an oblong, or generally elliptical shape, with rounded ends <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, since a square recess is more difficult to machine. However, recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be of any shape which prevents rotation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> while being sized for concealment by an abutting structural component. Furthermore, leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be any non-rounded (e.g., polygonal) shape that will cooperate with the geometry of recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to substantially prohibit rotation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is substantially universal in application. Brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may used to secure any first and second structural components together to produce a portion of a item of furniture, such as furniture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be used to secure an end panel to a back panel, a top panel to an end panel, or a bottom panel to a back panel, for example. While being substantially universal in application, and relatively strong, brackets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are at least partially (and, many times, completely) hidden from view in any of the mentioned orientations to provide an aesthetically pleasing item of furniture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C, 1D</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> illustrate a second embodiment mechanical joint in accordance with the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C, 1D</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> illustrate a mechanical joint formed between end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; and panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;. The second embodiment mechanical joint illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C, 1D</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be utilized to secure any two adjacent structural components as described above with respect to the first embodiment mechanical joint disclosed herein. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; is secured to surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; of end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; via fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> traverses aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; in first leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; to secure bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; to end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;. As fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> transverses aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; in first leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;, chamfer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; accommodates the head of fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is flush with first leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; when affixation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; to surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; of end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, face <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; includes face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> formed therein. Generally, face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is bored into face <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; with a bit. For the purposes of this document, &ldquo;face bore&rdquo; generally describes a substantially circular aperture formed by a bit having an axis of rotation substantially perpendicular to the face of the structural element in which the face bore is being formed. The boring operation utilized to form face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is generally easier to perform than the routing operations required to form recesses <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> illustrate face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in detail. As illustrated, face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> comprises a rounded recess formed in face <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;. In one exemplary embodiment, face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed with the center line or longitudinal axis of the bit displaced from the end of panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is sized to accommodate first leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; on formation of a mechanical joint in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention. This arrangement is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</cross-reference>. The sides of leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; are, in one exemplary embodiment, beveled. In this exemplary embodiment, the radius of curvature of the bevel of the sides of leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; substantially equals the radius of curvature of face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. With this in mind, face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can form an interference fit with leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; positioned therein. Furthermore, in another exemplary embodiment, second leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; has a width greater than the width of first leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; to better cover face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on formation of a mechanical joint in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In construction, bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; is secured to surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; of end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; via fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; is thereafter placed in abutting relationship with end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;, with face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> accommodating first leg <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; of fastener <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;. In one embodiment, a second fastener (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) may be utilized to secure second leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; to panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;. Furthermore, panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; may include a second recess similar to recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and described supra to accommodate second leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, end panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;, and panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; may be provided with pre-drilled apertures <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to facilitate affixation of bracket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; thereto via fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, when the mechanical joint of the second embodiment mechanical joint of the present invention is complete, face bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is hidden from view. </paragraph>
