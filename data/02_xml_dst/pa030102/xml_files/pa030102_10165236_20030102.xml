<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for transferring film bags which are supplied by a supply means in a plurality of parallel rows to a conveying means which further transports the film bags in a continuous row, and to an apparatus for performing the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Nowadays, film bags which are used as packing means are mostly treated automatically, for instance filled, closed and further processed. Such film bags consist e.g. of two side films that are sealed to one another at three edges and between the fourth edge of which a bottom film is sealed in that when said bottom film is unfolded room is created in the film bag for the filled product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In such an automated processing line, several film bags are often treated side by side at the same time. For instance, a number of film bags are simultaneously opened in a filling means, further transported by a transportation device, filled at the same time, further transported again and then closed at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, at other points of the processing line, the film bags must be supplied individually to a processing station. A typical example is e.g. the application of drinking straws to beverage film bags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This creates the problem that the film bags must be transferred by a transportation means which supplies a number of film bags in parallel, to another transportation means from which the film bags are discharged in a single row for further processing. This results in a discontinuous operation because a supplied number, corresponding to the row number supplied in parallel, must always be handed over simultaneously while the conveying means is at a standstill. Moreover, on account of the speeds nowadays used in such processing systems, strong acceleration and deceleration forces are created during transfer, which especially in the case of film bags may easily cause damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus for transferring film bags from a supply means which supplies the film bags in parallel simultaneously, to a conveying means which discharges the film bags in a single continuous row, a continuous operation being possible and the acceleration and deceleration forces on the film bags being reduced </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Said object is achieved by a method comprising the features of claim 1 and by an apparatus comprising the features of claim 6. Advantageous developments are the subject matter of the respective subclaims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the method of the invention a respective number of film bags which are simultaneously supplied to a transfer station are received all at once by a transfer device, preaccelerated by said device in the direction of movement of the conveying means, discharged to the conveying means and then transported away by the latter substantially in a direction perpendicular to the direction of supply. The method according to the invention permits a continuous operation. While a number of film bags are being transported by the transfer device to the conveying means and handed over to the latter, a further number of film bags are supplied by the supply means to the transfer station. On the other hand, the conveying means continues its travel, transporting away already transferred film bags for further processing while the transfer device takes over a new number of film bags from the supply means and transports the bags to the conveying means. With a corresponding setting of the relative speed between the supply means and the conveying means a continous operation is thereby ensured. Moreover, the preacceleration of the received film bags in the conveying direction has the effect that the acceleration forces are reduced upon discharge to the conveying means. Thus, damage upon discharge to the conveying means is prevented. Small acceleration forces during discharge also enhance the accuracy of the positioning operation for the bags on the conveying means </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention is particularly efficient when the speeds of the conveying means and of the transfer device are matched such that the conveying means transports away a number of film bags which have simultaneously been handed over, within the same period in which the transfer device has received a further identical number of film bags and transported and preaccelerated the same for discharge to the conveying means. It is thereby ensured that the capacity of the conveying means is exploited in an optimum way because no irregular distances on the discharge device can be created between the individual film bags. Moreover, this facilitates the further processing in automated processing stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, in the method of the invention the relative speed between the conveying means and the film bags at the moment of discharge to the conveying means may be zero or almost zero. Thus, acceleration forces acting on the film bags are entirely avoided during discharge, whereby the risk of damage to the film bags is further reduced and the accuracy of the bag positioning operation is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The film bags are simply transported away by the conveying means in a slightly inclined position. Such an inclined position permits an easy discharge operation because the film bags are held on the discharge device on account of their inclined position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The film bags can directly be deposited on the conveying means by the transfer device However, it is easier when the film bags are lifted from the supply means, transported via the conveying means and released at said place. The demands made on a precise discharging operation are thereby reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For performing the method of the invention, the apparatus according to the invention comprises a supply means which supplies film bags in parallel rows, a conveying means which transports away the film bags in a continuous row substantially in a direction perpendicular to the supply direction, and a transfer device which takes over from the supply means a respective number of film bags corresponding to the number of supplied rows, preaccelerates said bags in the direction of movement of the conveying means and discharges the same to the conveying means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The transfer device can perform the individual movements e.g. in the manner of a robot controlled by a microprocessor. A particularly simple configuration is however a transfer device which comprises a carrier, a transverse bar parallel thereto with carrier means for the film bags and at least one lever arm which interconnects the transverse bar and the carrier, the connections being designed such that the angle enclosed by the lever arm with the carrier or transverse bar is variable. Such an arrangement permits a preacceleration of the received film bags in an easy way by varying the angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Such a construction is particularly stable if at least two lever arms are provided so that the carrier, the lever arms and the transverse bar form a parallelogram of a variable angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The angle can be varied in various ways. One simple possibility consists in pivoting a lever arm with the help of a motor. Said motor can be controlled such that upon discharge of the film bags the transverse bar and the conveying means have a relative speed of zero or almost zero. Acceleration forces can thus not act on the film bags during the discharge operation, which reduces the risk of damage. Advantageously, the movement of the transverse bar in the area of the conveying means is so high that it is slightly higher than a film bag positioned on the conveying means. It is thereby avoided that the movement of the transverse bar might impede the transportation of the film bags. Moreover, it is thereby easily possible to release the film bags to the conveying means, which represents a simple possibility of discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To this end the transverse bar can perform a lifting movement during the transfer operation. To this end a linkage guide is just provided that effects the lifting movement during change in the angle between the at least one lever arm and the carrier. Such a linkage guide represents a possible configuration that is simple, mechanical and inexpensive. The lift can also be carried out pneumatically or by a motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The carrier means may comprise clamps on the transverse bar that are capable of gripping the film bags at the upper end thereof. The supply means may be an endless belt on which a number of film bags are conveyed in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Receiving cases in which the film bags are supplied may be arranged on the endless belt. The supply means may consist of chains extending in parallel and including receiving cases mounted thereon, in which the film bags are supplied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The discharge means may e.g. comprise a transportation belt. Advantageously, holding means are provided on such a transportation belt, the film bags being transported in said means. Such holding means ensure a safe transportation. Such a safe transportation can be realized in a particularly easy manner when the holding means are designed such that the film bags are transported in a slightly inclined position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It may here be that the film bags are directly transported away side by side. In an advantageous embodiment, however, the holding means comprise side guides for the film bags that ensure a regular arrangement of the film bags on the transportation belt in an easy way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the apparatus of the invention and the method of the invention shall now be explained in more detail with reference to the enclosed figures, in which: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a lateral schematic drawing of the same transfer station. A clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is provided on the transverse bar <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Arrow <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> designates the return direction of the emptied receiving cases <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in which the film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have been supplied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The right upper half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a state of the transfer station at a later time, in which after the lifting movement <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are opened above the holding means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the conveying transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> designates lateral guides of said holding means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This illustration shows that the bottom surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the holding means is inclined and the holding means only comprise one rear wall. The continuous line shows a film bag shortly after the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have been opened. A film bag which a moment later rests on the rear wall of the holding means is shown in broken line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention shall now be explained with reference to the mode of operation of the apparatus according to the invention by way of an exemplary transfer device in a machine for filling beverage film bags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The beverage film bags are supplied by the supply means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in parallel rows. Any desired number of parallel rows is here possible. The beverage film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are transported in receiving cases <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which are fastened to the supply means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in the left half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>respectively, clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> engage the beverage film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the transfer region. As soon as the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have been closed, the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> starts to move the lever arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in direction <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This creates a state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the beverage film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are transported away from the supply means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the help of the transverse bar <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the supply device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> moves on continuously to move a further number of beverage film bags into the transfer region. While the beverage film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are transported away, a lifting movement of the transverse bar <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is initiated. To this end a linkage guide is e.g. provided which for reasons of clarity is not explicitly shown in the figures; a motor type drive or a pneumatic drive serves as an alternative. A simple configuration is e.g. a ramp against which the lever arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>respectively, abut while being pivoted by the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The lever arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are pivoted <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> continuously up to the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The speed of the pivotal movement is here chosen such that at the time shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>the transverse bar <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has the same speed in conveying direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In this state the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are e.g. opened by a control means and the film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>fall into the holding means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> positioned thereunder. In this process they are aligned by the side guides <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in their lateral position. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the holding means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are equipped with a slightly inclined bottom surface so that the film bags come to rest in an inclined way. Since the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is continuously moved with the holding means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are continuously conveyed after ejection. The relative speed of the film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the discharge process is zero or almost zero, so that acceleration forces that might damage the film bags are not acting on the film bags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Upon release the pivotal movement of the lever arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is continued, as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Finally, the pivotal movement of the lever arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is reversed and the transverse bar is again returned along the same path which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and has been described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The linkage guide is traveled through in reverse direction. Alternatively, it is also possible to use a motor type drive or a pneumatic drive. Since the lifting movement <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has lifted the transverse bar to a height sufficiently above the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is ensured that the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> during the return movement of the transverse bar <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will not collide with the already deposited film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The pivotal return movement is continued until the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is reached again, and the transfer operation is repeated with the next number of film bags While the transverse bar <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is further pivoted or pivoted back after the discharge operation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and while a new number of film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are taken over on the transverse bar with the clamps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and moved to the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, said belt is continuously moving on. With a suitably timed coordination, the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is thus advanced further exactly by such a distance that the film bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be ejected onto the transportation belt <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> directly in accordance with the previously discharged number of film bags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thus the above-described apparatus and the associated method make it possible that two continuously conveying transportation belts can be used and that a transfer is possible although on the one transportation belt quite a number of film bags are simultaneously conveyed to the transfer station while the other conveying means discharges a single continuous row. Such a continuous supply and discharge facilitates the integration of such a transfer device into an automated processing system. Thanks to the preacceleration of the film bags to the speed of the conveying transportation belt, the risk of damage to the film bags is reduced in addition to an acceleration of the whole process. </paragraph>
