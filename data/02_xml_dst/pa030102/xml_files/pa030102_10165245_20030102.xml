<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to systems and apparatus for managing gas flow through internal combustion engines; more particularly, to one or more valving devices associated with the intake manifold of an internal combustion engine; and most particularly, to an intake manifold assembly for an internal combustion engine, such as a diesel engine or a variable valve lift gasoline engine, wherein an exhaust gas recirculation valve, a manifold inlet air control valve, and other gas-control valves as may be necessary, are integrated into the assembly, and further, wherein inlet air control is made linear by use of a poppet valve actuated by a cam lobe on a camshaft. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is a characteristic of diesel engines and some variable valve lift gasoline engines that virtually no vacuum exists in the intake manifolds of such engines. The lack of vacuum creates problems in providing vacuum-assisted functions for applications such as automotive vehicles, marine vessels, and stationary power generators. A conventional gasoline-powered engine includes a throttle valve at the inlet to the intake manifold to control the flow of air into the engine and thereby to regulate the speed of the engine. Such throttling of the inlet variably creates a subatmospheric condition in the manifold. Recirculation of exhaust gas into the intake manifold uses a pressure drop between the exhaust manifold and the intake manifold to draw exhaust gas into the intake manifold. Such a pressure drop is virtually nonexistent in an unmodified diesel engine and also in a gasoline engine wherein gas flow is controlled by varying the lift of the intake valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known to create manifold vacuum in a diesel intake manifold by providing an air control valve at the manifold inlet, typically a rotary butterfly-type valve. Such a valve is typically actuated by an electric motor and gear train or a stepper motor and is provided as a subassembly which must be attached to the manifold as by bolting and which requires its own power and control connections in a wiring harness. Disadvantageously, a rotary butterfly valve has a highly non-linear flow profile as a function of valve angle; is difficult to close completely without jamming; and typically passes significant air flow in the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is further known to provide an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve having its own actuator and valve body which also must be bolted to the intake manifold. EGR valves typically are actuated by an electric solenoid in either a position-modulated or time-modulated mode, requiring additional and separate power and control connections. Further, such solenoids are known to be vulnerable to failure from corrosion by permeated exhaust gas. Prior art EGR valves provide exhaust gas globally to the interior of the intake manifold which then distributes the gas along with intake air via runners to the individual cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is further known to provide dual intake ports to each diesel cylinder, one such port being open at all times and the other such port being closable by a butterfly-type valve. The ports are off-axis of the cylinders such that when the valves are closed, as under low engine load conditions, air entering the cylinder is swirled advantageously to center the fuel charge in the cylinder. Typically, the individual valves are actuated by, for example, electrically-powered rotary actuators similar to that known for a throttle valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a principal object of the present invention to simplify an air intake manifold and associated control valving for a diesel engine, valve-lift controlled gasoline engine, or other gasoline engine, to reduce manufacturing cost, ease assembly, improve and integrate air control through an engine, and increase engine reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to mechanically link and actuate such valving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the invention to make inlet air control linear by use of a poppet valve actuated by a cam lobe on a camshaft. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Briefly described, an integrated intake manifold assembly in accordance with the invention includes a poppet manifold vacuum regulating valve (MVR valve) disposed at the air inlet to the manifold to regulate air flow into the manifold; a poppet EGR valve disposed on the manifold to regulate exhaust gas flow into the air intake system; and a bi-directional camshaft and cams for operating simultaneously the MVR valve and the EGR valve. The valve bodies are integrally formed in the wall of the intake manifold. The camshaft is driven by a single brush DC motor and gear train. The cams are arranged on the shaft to provide optimum synchronized opening and closing of the related valves. The cams may also be individually shaped as needed to optimize the actuation profile of each valve. When used on a diesel engine, the assembly may further include a swirl valve plate disposed between the manifold and the engine head and having a plurality of ganged swirl valves actuated by linkage connected to the camshaft for coordinated motion with the MVR and EGR valves. Preferably, the swirl valve plate is also ported as a distribution rail to receive exhaust gas from the EGR valve and distribute it to the individual cylinders, bypassing altogether the interior of the intake manifold and obviating soot deposits in the manifold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The valve poppets of the MVR and EGR valves are modified as forked yokes which engage the camshaft as reciprocating struts to minimize side loading of the valve stems by the rotary action of the cams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An integrated intake manifold assembly in accordance with the invention, when compared to prior art assemblies of stand-alone components, eliminates eight bolts and two gaskets; eliminates two actuators and related wiring; eliminates vacuum actuation and hoses; reduces soot in the air intake system, protecting air components; reduces electrical connections to two; simplifies manufacture and assembly; and reduces the overall size and mass of the air control system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the following description, the embodiment is assumed to be oriented such that an associated engine is beside, and an exhaust manifold below, the embodiment. The use of the terms up, down, upper, lower, above, and below assume such an orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference>, an integrated intake manifold assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention includes an intake manifold element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably formed as by die casting of metal such as aluminum alloy. Formed integrally with element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are a first housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for a manifold vacuum regulating (MVR) valve assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; a second housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; a third housing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for a drive motor (not visible in these drawings); a fourth housing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for a gear train (also not visible); a fifth housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for a lever actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> attached to a camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>; a first mounting flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for attaching assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an engine block or head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>; a second mounting flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for attaching assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>; and a receptacle <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for mounting of a manifold vacuum sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having an electrical connector <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for conventional connection to an engine control module (ECM) (not shown). Unlike prior art intake manifolds in which MVR valves and EGR valves are assembled onto a manifold and require independent electrical actuation, position sensing, and control, the present MVR and EGR valves are integrally formed into the manifold itself and mechanically actuated by a common camshaft, as described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Attached to, but separate from, integrated intake manifold assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a swirl valve plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> disposed between assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes first ports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, for distributing air from manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into each of four engine cylinders (not shown) under low engine load, and second ports <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in flow parallel with first ports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for providing additional air under high load conditions. Air flow from manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through second ports <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be regulated by swirl control valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which are ganged for unified action by being mounted on a single control shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extending through axially aligned bores <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> connects first lever actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a similar second lever actuator <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 18</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) attached to shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. When valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are closed, air is introduced tangentially to the cylinders only via ports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, causing a swirling motion which tends to desirably center the fuel charge on the piston. Under high air and fuel volumes, when valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are open, such swirling is unimportant and is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Such linkage may be attached to actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> either above the axis of rotation, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, or below the axis of rotation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> allows for the actuation of a swirl-port system with no linkages external to the intake manifold. All of the components of this mechanism thus may be hidden internally, within the intake manifold and swirl plate, by appropriately configuring the manifold. After the assembly is mounted to the engine, all moving parts are concealed and protected from the environment, providing a safe, robust assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Preferably, plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is also provided with a longitudinal channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> matable with a similar channel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed in assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form an exhaust gas distribution rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> supplied with exhaust gas via an exhaust gas conduit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from EGR valve assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is connected via individual runners (not visible) to each of first ports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for dispensing exhaust gas into each of the cylinders of engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This arrangement thus accomplishes controlled exhaust gas recirculation to the cylinders without exposing the interior of the intake manifold to soot and corrosive oxides. Of course, for simplicity of construction, an integrated EGR valve assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention may simply feed exhaust gas via a conduit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; analogous to conduit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> directly into intake manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for distribution with air into the cylinders, as in the prior art. Further, in some applications of the invention to spark-ignited gasoline powered engines, the swirl plate is not needed and distribution of EGR to the individual cylinders is not required, in which case assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted directly onto engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and conduit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; represents the preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In gasoline engines throttled by variable valve lift, valve assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may function as a manifold vacuum regulating valve, substantially as in a diesel engine as described herein. However, in gasoline engines throttled conventionally by a manifold inlet valve, an integrated intake manifold assembly in accordance with the invention may be usefully adapted for conventional throttle control by valve assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the mechanism <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the invention is housed in the various integrated housings formed in manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as recited above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The power train is a conventional motor and reduction gear train. A single brush DC motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, housed in third housing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is provided with a first pinion gear <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which meshes with first ring gear <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> mounted on an idle shaft <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Second pinion gear <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, attached to first ring gear <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, meshes with second ring gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which is mounted on camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> via an output spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A camshaft position sensor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is disposed on the proximal end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The gear train and position sensor are housed in a cover <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> boltable to the intake manifold. An electrical connector <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> provides power and operating signals to the motor and carries information from position sensor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> to the ECM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is journalled in three sets of ball bearings <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> retained in bearing mounts formed in intake manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and rotates about an axis <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. MVR cam <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and EGR cam <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, having throughbores, are mounted on camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at predetermined axial locations and at a predetermined angular relationship to each other. After the cams have been properly positioned during assembly, they are fixed in place by set screws <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Preferably, after assembly and testing, the cams are drilled and pinned <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to the camshaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</cross-reference>, manifold vacuum regulating valve assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a poppet valve head <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> for mating with seat <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> formed integrally with manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Seat <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is formed in a bore <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> defining an air inlet to manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A valve pintle <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> extends from the underside of poppet head <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and is received in a pintle bearing insert <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> disposed in a cylindrical boss <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed in manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for guiding the pintle and head along a first axis of motion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> orthogonal to camshaft axis <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> during actuation of the valve. A return spring <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> surrounds boss <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and is seated against a step in boss <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for urging head <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> toward seat <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, to a normally-closed position. Poppet valve head <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is further provided with a slot and transverse bore for receiving a roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for following the surface of MVR cam <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, MVR valve assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown in the open position, permitting the passage of air through inlet bore <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> into intake manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, spring <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is selected and the valve head and seat are constructed such that assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fully closed when the engine is shut down. This prevents entry of additional air into the engine, important for some gasoline engines in preventing the well-known &ldquo;diesel&rdquo; effect of continued compressive running after the ignition is off. Prior art butterfly-type manifold entry valves are incapable of providing this advantage. Additionally, the spring strength of spring <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is preferably selected such that, in the event of valve control failure, the valve can be forced open by air compressed by a diesel supercharger and the engine can continue to run although non-optimally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, and additionally <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, exhaust gas recirculation valve assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a poppet valve head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for mating with seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> inserted into a step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in a bell-shaped valve body <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> formed integrally with manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Body <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> terminates at its lower end in flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, as recited above, for mounting onto exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A valve pintle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extends through poppet head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and is secured thereto by nut <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, which sets the tolerance stack-up in the valve assembly. Further, pintle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extends from the upper side of poppet head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and is received in a stepped bore <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> formed in manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for guiding the pintle and head along a second axis of motion <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> orthogonal to camshaft axis <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> during actuation of the valve. A return spring <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> surrounds pintle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and is captured between a pintle bearing insert <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and an annular flange <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on pintle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for urging head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> toward seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to a normally-closed position. The upper end of pintle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is further provided with a slot and transverse bore for receiving a roller <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> for following the surface of EGR cam <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, first conduit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> connects EGR valve assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to exhaust gas rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, EGR valve assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in the closed position, preventing the passage of exhaust gas through flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into exhaust gas rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, preferably EGR cam <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is provided with a hook portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> which engages and captures roller <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> when cam <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is rotated sufficiently counterclockwise, thereby mechanically locking assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, each of valve poppets in assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with a yoke element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> extending from either the valve head (MVR valve head <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>) or the valve pintle (EGR valve pintle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) toward camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and terminating in flat fork tines <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> which embrace the camshaft and preferably are slidingly fitted against their respective cam lobes <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. If desired, additional stiffness of the tines may be obtained by connecting the tines with a strap <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The tines thus provide lateral support to the valve pintles <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at their upper ends and thereby inhibit side loading of the pintles by the rotary action of the cam lobes. This reduces wear on the pintles and pintle bearings and increases the working life and reliability of the valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the operation of an integrated intake manifold assembly in accordance with the invention. Exemplary actuation curves for the swirl valve shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, MVR valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and EGR valve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown for a typical diesel engine application. Also refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 through 19</cross-reference> wherein the accompanying action of the swirl valve control subassembly <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is shown. Relative valve position is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> as a function of camshaft position. Arbitrarily, the curves represent full engine speed at the far left (270&deg; of camshaft rotation) and engine shutdown at the far right (0&deg; of camshaft rotation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Beginning at maximum engine speed and air flow, shown at the far left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the swirl valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) and the MVR are fully open. There is no exhaust gas recirculation. The EGR valve is both closed and locked shut by hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to prevent its being forced open by high intake manifold pressures from the engine turbocharger which would limit the effectiveness of the turbocharger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Because first lever actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has an arcuate slotted opening <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for connection to link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the camshaft and swirl control body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are able to rotate counterclockwise sufficiently (about 20&deg;) to unlock the EGR valve before link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> becomes engaged in controlling the swirl valves. First torsion spring <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is disposed in torsional compression on body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> between notch <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and pin extension <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), thus urging link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> toward the valve-closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>. Second torsion spring <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is also disposed in torsional compression on body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> between lever actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a recess in manifold <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (not shown) but is counter-wound from spring <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Spring <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> urges actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> counterclockwise as seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (springs omitted or partially omitted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for clarity). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is provided with a radial tang <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which can engage an axial tang <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> extending from body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In the 0&deg; camshaft position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are are rotated by the camshaft such that the EGR valve is both closed and locked shut by hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As engine load is decreased (camshaft begins to rotate counterclockwise), the EGR valve is unlocked in the first <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of rotation. Because first lever actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has arcuate slotted opening <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for connection to link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the camshaft is able to rotate clockwise sufficiently to unlock the EGR valve without beginning to close the swirl valves, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> becomes engaged by actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the right end of slot <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Between about 25&deg; and 45&deg; of rotation, link <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is drawn counterclockwise by actuating lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, closing the swirl valves completely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, and the engine thus becomes supplied with air solely through first ports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The link is now prevented by the closing of the swirl valves from traveling farther, so further rotation of body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is prevented; the camshaft, however, may continue to be rotated within body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as body <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is rotatably disposed on sealed bearings <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) mounted on camshaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As camshaft rotation continues, tang <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> separates from tang <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At about 50&deg; of camshaft rotation, the EGR valve begins to open, adding exhaust gas to the air entering the cylinders. The MVR valve remains wide open until about 90&deg; of rotation, then begins to close. Because the MVR valve is a poppet valve rather than a conventional rotary butterfly valve, the open area of the valve between the seat and head is cylindrical and therefore flow through the valve is linear with respect to pintle motion, and the slope of the curve is readily controlled by appropriately shaping the MVR cam lobe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The normal operating range of the engine is typically between cam positions of about 100&deg; and 150&deg;. Beyond about 180&deg;, the MVR valve is fully closed (no fresh air is being admitted to the engine) and the EGR valve is fully open. Such a condition may be useful during non-combustive periods, such as going downhill, when fuel is withheld from the cylinders and recirculation of stale exhaust gas can progressively cool the engine cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Finally, at engine shutdown, the camshaft is rotated to about 270&deg; to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and the swirl, MVR, and EGR valves are closed. When the engine is restarted, the camshaft is automatically rotated clock wise through a predetermined angle to provide optimal opening settings for the MVR and EGR valves, the swirl valves remaining closed until high engine speed is again required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> All the recited camshaft positions are programmed into a conventional engine control module in known fashion, which module receives various engine inputs including manifold pressure signals from sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and cam position signals from sensor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The ECM controls the action of motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> responsive to these and other signals and algorithms stored therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described by reference to various specific embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes may be made within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the described embodiments, but will have full scope defined by the language of the following claims. </paragraph>
