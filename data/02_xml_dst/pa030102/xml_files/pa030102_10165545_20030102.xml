<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for facilitating the movement of fluids, transferring mechanical power to fluid mediums, as well as deriving power from moving fluids. The present invention employs an impeller system in a variety of applications involving the displacement of fluids, including for example, any conventional pump, fan, compressor, generator, turbine, transmission, various hydraulic and pneumatic systems, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various forms of impeller systems have been employed in a diversity of inventions, including turbines, pumps, fans, compressors, homogenizers, as well as other devices. The common link between these devices is the displacement of fluid, in either a gaseous or liquid state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Impeller systems may be broadly categorized as having either a single rotor assembly, such as a water pump (U.S. Pat. No. 5,224,821) or homogenizer (U.S. Pat. No. 2,952,448); or a single radially arranged multi-vaned assembly, such as a fan or blower (U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,499); or a multi-disc assembly mounted on a central shaft, as in a laminar flow fan (U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,183). Impeller systems employing vanes, blades, paddles, etc. operate by colliding with and pushing the fluid being displaced. This type of operation introduces shocks and vibrations to the fluid medium resulting in turbulence, which impedes the movement of the fluid and ultimately reduces the overall efficiency of the system. One of the inherent advantages of a multi-disc impeller system is obviating this deficiency by imparting movement to the fluid medium in such a manner as to allow movement along natural lines of least resistance, thereby reducing turbulence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 1,061,142 describes an apparatus for propelling or imparting energy to fluids comprising a runner set having a series of spaced discs fixed to a central shaft. The discs are centrally attached to the shaft running perpendicular to the discs. Each disc has a number of central openings, with solid portions in-between to form spokes, which radiate inwardly to the central hub, through which a central shaft runs, providing the only means of support for the discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 1,061,206 discloses the application of a runner set similar to that described above for use in a turbine or rotary engine. The runner set comprises a series of discs having central openings with spokes connecting the body of the disc to a central shaft. As in the aforementioned patent, the only means of support for the discs is the connection to the central shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The designs of the disc and runner set of the aforementioned pump and turbine have significant shortcomings. For example, the discs have a central aperture with spokes radiating inwardly to a central hub, which is fixedly mounted to a perpendicular shaft. The only means of support for the discs are the spokes radiating to the central shaft. The disc design, the use of a centrally located shaft, and the means of connecting the discs to the central shaft, individually, and especially in combination, create turbulence in the fluid medium, resulting in an inefficient transfer of energy. As the discs are driven through a fluid medium, the spokes collide with the fluid causing turbulence, which is transmitted to the fluid in the form of heat and vibration, and the centrally oriented shaft interferes with the fluid&apos;s natural path of flow causing excessive turbulence and loss of efficiency. Additionally, the spoke arrangement colliding with the fluid medium creates cavitations, which in turn, may cause pitting or other damage to the surfaces of components. And finally, the arrangement of the runner set does not sufficiently support the discs during operation, resulting in a less efficient system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,961 describes a fluid driven turbine generator utilizing a single rotor having magnets secured in a receptacle shaped portion and spinning about a stationary core to produce electricity. Fluid jets drive the single rotor by impinging on a circumferential roughened surface of the receptacle shaped portion of the rotor. The present invention is distinct from the above in that it employs a multi-disc impeller system rather than a single rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is a need in the art for a more efficient means of displacing fluids and generating power from propelled fluids without introducing unnecessary turbulence to the fluid medium and loss of energy transfer through heat and vibration. The present invention alleviates the shortcomings of the art and is distinct from conventional systems. The present invention provides a compact, efficient and versatile system for driving fluids and generating power from propelled fluids. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides systems and methods for facilitating the movement of fluids, transferring mechanical power to fluid mediums, as well as deriving power from moving fluids. Embodiments of the present invention exploit the natural physical properties of fluids to create a more efficient means of driving fluids as well as transferring power from propelled fluids. An impeller assembly is provided that may be incorporated into a wide range of devices, such as pumps, fans, compressors, generators, circulators, blowers, generators, turbines, transmissions, various hydraulic and pneumatic systems, and the like. According to one aspect of the present invention, an impeller assembly is provided comprising a plurality of substantially flat discs, a plurality of spacing elements, a plurality of connecting elements, at least one central hub and one or more support plates. The plurality of discs and spacing elements are alternately arranged in a parallel fashion along a central rotational axis and held in tight association by connecting elements forming a stacked array. One or more first support plates may be fixedly connected to, or integral with, the central hub. The stacked array of discs and associated elements are fixedly connected to the first support plate or plates and thereby interconnected to the central hub. A second one or more support plates is fixedly connected to the opposing end of the stacked array of discs, thereby providing structural integrity to the impeller assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, each disc comprises a viscous drag surface area having a central aperture. The viscous drag surface area is essentially flat and devoid of any substantial projections, grooves, vanes and the like. Discs of the present invention further comprise one or more support structures, such as a series of support islets, located on the inside perimeter of the disc for receiving spacing and/or connecting elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention, discs are interconnected by conventional structural elements, such as spacers and connecting rods, attached to the interior perimeter of each disc and supporting plate. The connecting rods in turn are attached to the central hub. Connected to the shaft of the central hub assembly is a mechanism for rotating the central hub and impeller assembly, such as a motor or some similar mechanism. In alternative embodiments, the central hub may be connected to any conventional rotational energy translating mechanism, such as drive shafts and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with further aspects of the present invention, the parallel arrangement of the discs&apos; central apertures of the stacked array generally define a central cavity of the impeller assembly, creating a fluid conduit. In addition, the plurality of intermittently arranged discs, spacing, and connecting elements define a plurality of inter-disc spaces which is continuous with the central cavity of the staked array. Fluid may flow freely between the plurality of inter-disc spaces and the central cavity of the stacked array. According to yet other aspects, the present invention provides systems and methods wherein the impeller assembly works in conjunction with the interior surface of a housing to create zones of high and low pressure within the impeller assembly and internal chamber of the housing causing the fluid medium to drawn into and eventually expelled from the pump system. Pump systems of the present invention further comprise a mechanism for rotating the impeller assembly such that the plurality of discs are rotationally driven through the fluid medium, which displaces and accelerates the fluid through viscous drag to impart tangential and centrifugal forces to the fluid with continuously increasing velocity along a spiral path, causing the fluid to be discharged from an outlet. The principle of operation is based on the inherent physical properties of adhesion and viscosity of the fluid medium, which when propelled, allows the fluid to adjust to natural streaming patterns and to adjust its velocity and direction without the excessive shearing and turbulence associated with traditional vane-type rotors or impellers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as discs of the impeller assembly are rotated and driven through the fluid medium, the fluid layer in immediate contact with the discs is also rotated due to the strong adhesion forces between fluid and disc. The fluid is subjected to two forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation, and the other centrifugally in an outward radial direction. The combined effects of these forces propels the fluid with continuously increasing velocity in a spiral path The fluid increases in velocity as it moves through the inter-disc spaces causing zones of negative pressure. The continued movement of the accelerating fluid from the inside perimeter of the discs to the outside perimeter draws fluid from the central cavity of the impeller assembly, which is essentially continuous with an inlet port. The net negative pressure created within the internal chamber of the pump draws fluid from an outside source. As fluid is accelerated through the inter-disc spaces to the outside perimeter of the discs, the continued momentum drives the fluid against the inner wall of the housing chamber creating a zone of higher pressure defined by the gap between the outside perimeter of the discs and the inner wall of the housing chamber. The fluid is driven from the zone of relative high pressure to a zone of ambient pressure defined by the outlet port and any further connections to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to further aspects of the present invention, the flow rate is generally in proportion to the dimensions and rotational speed of the discs. As the surface area of the discs is increased by increasing the viscous drag surface area, so too is the amount of fluid in intimate contact with the discs, and therefore the greater the amount of fluid being driven, increasing the flow rate. As the number of discs is increased, the overall viscous drag surface area increases, which results in an increased flow rate. In addition, as the rotational speed of the impeller assembly is increased, the greater the tangential and centripetal forces being applied to the fluid, which will naturally increase the flow rate of the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to further aspects, methods and systems of the present invention may be applicable to any system facilitating the movement of fluids, transferring mechanical power to fluid mediums, as well as deriving power from moving fluid mediums, such as, for example, pumps, pneumatic and/or hydraulic pumps, hydraulic and/or pneumatic compressors, jet pumps, marine jet pumps, any conventional air circulators, blowers and/or fans, pumps and circulating pumps, pumps and circulating pumps for any conventional engine and/or motor, appliance fans and/or pumps, electronic component fans/blowers/circulators, pool and fountain circulating pumps, propulsion jets for baths and spas, air humidifiers, well and sump pumps, vacuum pumps, turbines, jet turbines, transmissions, generators, fluid-powered generators, wind-powered generators, pressurized hydraulic and pneumatic systems, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to still yet further aspects of the present invention, methods and systems are provided which generate little heat during operation thereby minimizing consequential heating of the fluid medium. Therefore, systems incorporating impeller systems of the present invention are particularly well suited for displacing low temperature liquids, such as liquefied gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to further aspects, pump and/or circulating systems incorporating impeller assemblies of the present invention may be used to displace temperature and turbulence sensitive fluids, such as food products and biological fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to still further aspects of the present invention, impeller assemblies of the present invention may be incorporated into medical devices and apparatus involved with the movement of fluids, such as devices for moving biological fluids, medicines, therapeutics, pharmaceutical preparations, and the like. Examples may include heart pumps, circulatory pumps of all sorts, such as in heart and lung bypass apparatus, dialysis, and plasmaphoresis devices, as well as injection pumps for the delivery of medicines, therapeutics, pharmaceutical preparations and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Impeller assemblies and systems incorporating impeller assemblies of the present invention have significant advantages over the prior art. The multi-disc impeller assembly possesses significantly more surface area in comparison to single rotor designs. The increased surface area in combination with viscous drag operation creates a superior design. Elimination of the central shaft and creation of a central cavity within the impeller assembly contributes to efficiency. As previously mentioned, the central shaft of conventional designs impedes the natural flow of fluid through the impeller system and also contributes to turbulence and loss of energy transfer by generating heat and vibration. By employing a central hub design, a central cavity of the impeller system is created, which permits fluid to flow unobstructed through the impeller assembly, thereby reducing unnecessary friction and turbulence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Other aspects of the present invention provide a number of embodiments incorporating impeller assemblies, such as a pump system. Pump systems of the present invention may be used to displace all forms of fluids, whether liquid or gaseous, and is equally well suited for high volume and/or high pressure applications as well as low to medium pressure applications. Pump systems of the present invention comprise an impeller assembly, as generally described above, and any conventional housing and associated components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, jet pumps, such as a marine jet pump are provided. As with the previously described pump system, jet pumps of the present invention utilize an impeller assembly and employ the same principles of operation. The impeller assembly is rotationally driven through the fluid medium causing the fluid to accelerate, the resultant negative pressure within the housing draws fluid from the external environment through a specialized conduit and is eventually discharged through an exhaust port to supply the propulsive force. In certain embodiments, the exhausted fluid is preferably attached to a standard marine directional nozzle to direct the fluid stream. The present invention eliminates the use of the standard multi-blade or vane impeller systems, resulting in less turbulence and loss of energy through generation of heat and vibration. In addition, impeller assemblies of the present invention are also resistant to wear from the abrasive action of suspended particulates in the fluid medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect of the present invention, turbines are provided, such as hydroelectric and fluid turbines. These embodiments of the present invention also employ a similar impeller assembly, but, rather than applying power to the impeller assembly for the displacement of fluids, the hydroelectric turbine provides power through the impeller assembly via propelled fluids. The same fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and transfer of energy apply, but in reverse. The kinetic energy of the fluid is transferred to the impeller assembly to provide rotational movement to the shaft, which is harnessed by any conventional mechanisms. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a fluid turbine is provided. Similar to the hydroelectric turbine, the kinetic energy of the fluid is transferred to the impeller assembly to provide rotational movement to the shaft, which is harnessed in any number of ways. The same fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and transfer of energy apply as previously described apply. Sub-components of the impeller assembly for this embodiment have several modifications to accommodate the method of operation. These modifications, as well as a detailed description of the embodiment, are described below in the detailed description of the preferred embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a turbine transmission is provided. This embodiment comprises a number of subsystems, including a turbine section, a pump section, a sump assembly and a high-pressure line interconnecting the pump and turbine sections. The subsystems are combined to form a closed system through which a fluid medium flows. This embodiment is particularly useful for driving items with a soft engagement requirement, such as motion sensitive machinery, marine use and most any other application requiring especially smooth, quiet and efficient transfer of power. The turbine transmission is especially adaptable to close quarters installation requirements and offers significantly lower noise and vibration levels during operation. Many of the features of the sub-components of the turbine transmission, as well as principles of operation, are described in the detailed description of the pump and the fluid turbine. Additional modifications and features will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present invention may provide a fuel turbine having a compressor impeller assembly and/or a power impeller assembly and a gear section having a shaft extending from the compressor to the power impeller assemblies. A starter, such as a starter shaft, may also be included to activate the compressor impeller assembly. The compressor impeller assembly may include a central hub that may radially move, a stacked array of parallel discs to create high pressure in a fluid and a fluid outlet to release the high pressure fluid. Each disc may have a central aperture and be inter-spaced along a parallel axis. Upon radial movement of the central hub, a fluid may flow through the central apertures of the stacked array of discs and the spaces between the discs to increase the pressure of the fluid. The power impeller assembly may comprise a combustor to introduce the high pressure fluid to the fuel and to ignite the fuel. The combustor may have a fluid inlet to receive the released high pressure fluid and a fuel inlet to receive fuel. The power impeller assembly may further comprise a central hub and a stacked array of parallel discs, each disc having a central aperture and being inter-spaced along a parallel axis. Upon ignition of the fuel, a fluid may flow across the stacked array of discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the fuel turbine, at least two rods extend through the discs of the power impeller assembly and/or compressor impeller assembly and one end of the rods is attached to a support frame at rod attachments. The support frame may also include a shaft attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Other aspects of the present invention relate to a support frame that may be employed in any of the various embodiments of an impeller assembly as described herein, having a stacked array of parallel inter-spaced discs and at least two rods extending through the array of discs. The support frame may comprise at least two rod attachments for securing one end of a rod to the array of discs, and at least two arms having a first arm end being coupled to at least one of the rod attachment. The support frame may further include a shaft attachment, which may be coupled to a second arm end.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for facilitating the movement of fluids, transferring mechanical power to fluid mediums, as well as deriving power from moving fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> 1. Impeller Assembly in the Context of a Pump System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-E, an impeller assembly incorporated into a pump system and its various components are illustrated. For the sake of clarity, the impeller assembly of the present invention is described in the context of a pump system, but is also utilized in other embodiments described herein and may be incorporated into a wide range of devices, as previously described. Although there may be modifications to the impeller assemblies used in the other embodiments, many of the same general designs, features, sub-components and qualifications described below apply to these modified versions. As a result, the detailed description of the other embodiments will incorporate much of the impeller assembly disclosure provided immediately below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the pump system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> comprises a plurality of viscous drag discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranged parallel to one another with distinct spaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> located between each disc. A top perspective of a representative disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. Discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are substantially flat with a central aperture <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which defines an inside perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forms the viscous drag surface area and defines the outer perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The viscous drag surface area of the discs is essentially flat and devoid of any purposefully raised protrusions, engraved texturing, grooves and/or vanes. The surface area need not be completely devoid of any texture, and in certain applications may possess a roughened surface to provide additional friction for displacing fluid, so long as the roughened surface does not create substantial disruptive turbulence in the fluid medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Along inner perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are a series of support structures, such as support islets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> protruding into central aperture <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments may comprise support structures that do not protrude into central aperture <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and may include embodiments having support structures inset along inner perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each support islet contains a central aperture <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which has been undercut <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments may comprise support structures, such as support islets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, that are not undercut and may be essentially flush with, or projecting above, inner perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The number of support islets varies depending on the specific application. As described below, support islets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> serve as a mechanism to interconnect and support a plurality of discs to form a stacked array of impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A preferred number of support islets may range from 3 to greater than 6, and in the preferred embodiment described herein, 6 are shown. In alternative preferred embodiments, impeller assemblies comprising 3, 4 or 5 support islets are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be composed of any suitable material possessing sufficient mechanical strength, as well as physical and/or chemical inertness to the fluid medium being displaced, such as, but not limited to, resistance to extreme temperatures, pH, biocompatibility to food products or biological fluids, and the like. Discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may, for example, be composed of metal, metal alloys, ceramics, plastics, and the like. Optionally, discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be composed of a high-friction material to provide additional surface friction for displacing fluid. The general, the dimensions of disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such as overall circumference, central aperture diameter and width, are variable and determined by the particular use. The size of the housing and the desired flow rate of a particular fluid also influence the size and number of discs in the impeller assembly. Because only the viscous drag surface areas of the discs significantly affect the flow of fluid, it is desirable that the discs of the impeller assembly be as thin as the specific application will allow. Therefore, it is preferable that discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have a thickness capable of maintaining sufficient mechanical strength against stresses, pressures and centrifugal forces generated within the pump, yet as thin as conditions allow to reduce unnecessary turbulence. Discs may be from {fraction (1/1000)} to several inches in width, depending on the application. The materials and dimensions of the discs are largely dependent on the specific application involved, in particular the viscosity of the fluid, the desired flow rate and the resultant operating pressures. In certain embodiments, particularly small applications, the entire impeller assembly may be made of plastics or other material that may be formed by any conventional methods, such as injection molding, or other comparable method, to form an integrated impeller assembly rather than the individual components described below. Alternatively, embodiments of impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be formed of die cast metal, machined metal and/or metal alloy or powdered metal assemblies for applications requiring greater mechanical strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The inter-disc spaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> between discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is maintained by a plurality of spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which, together with the discs, create a stacked array of alternating discs and spacers <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> possess a central aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> complementary with the islet aperture <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of support islets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be of any suitable conformation that does not create undue turbulence in the fluid medium, such as round, oval, polygonal, oblong, and the like, and composed of any suitable material compatible with other components of the pump system and the fluid being displaced, such as metals, metal alloys, ceramics and/or plastics. Alternative embodiments of the present invention may have spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> integrated into discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rather than distinct components, such as, but not limited to, one or more raised sections integrated with islets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of inner rim <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The height of spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is an additional variable in the design of the impeller system and is dependent on the specific application. For example, the inter-disc spacing, and therefore the height of spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, may be from {fraction (1/100)} to greater than 2 inches, preferably from {fraction (1/32)} to 1 inch, and more preferably from {fraction (1/16)} to &frac12; inch. In general, the spacing of discs should be such that the entire mass of fluid is accelerated to a nearly uniform velocity, essentially equivalent to the velocity achieved at the periphery of the discs, and thereby generating sufficient pressure by the combined centrifugal and tangential forces imparted to the fluid to effectively and efficiently drive the fluid. The greater the height of spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the greater the inter-disc space <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which has a direct effect on the negative pressure generated within the pump housing. For example, in low pressure/high volume applications, such as embodiments designed for pumping gases, the inter-disc spacing may be larger than that required for displacing liquids, for example, {fraction (1/16)} to about &frac12; inch. Furthermore, displacement of liquid gases may require inter-disc spacing on the low end of the preferred ranges provided above, or if necessary, beyond those ranges for optimal performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The number of discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may vary depending upon the particular use. In preferred embodiments, impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises between 4 and 100 discs and in especially preferred embodiments between 4 and 50 discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further comprises a central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> serves to transfer rotational power applied to the receiving end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the shaft section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the stacked array <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of discs. Central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> possesses a flange section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> distal to the shaft section, having an inside <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and outside <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> face. Inside face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of flange section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is in immediate contact with an outside face <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a first reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments of the present invention also encompass designs wherein central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and first reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are one integral work-piece, whether cast or machined. The inside face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of first reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is in immediate contact with a plurality of spacers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A second reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is located distal to the stacked array of spacers and discs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, first and second reinforcing backing plates <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have substantially the same design and dimensions as viscous drag discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As evidenced in the illustration, first and second reinforcing backing plates <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of impeller system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are considerably thicker than the discs in order to provide additional mechanical support to the stacked array of discs to counteract the negative pressure created in the inter-disc spaces, particularly at the outside periphery of the discs. The reinforcing backing plates serve as a support means for the discs by providing a solid and relatively inflexible surface for the discs to pull against, thereby reducing the tendency of the discs to flex and deflect inwardly in the inter-disc spaces. The thickness of the reinforcing backing plates is largely dependent on the diameter, and therefore the surface area, of the discs. As a general principle, the reinforcing backing plates may be approximately four times as thick as the discs, but this relationship may vary dependent on the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, first reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, stacked array of spacers and discs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and second reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly are interconnected by a plurality of connecting rods <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Distal end <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of connecting rods <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> pass through apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of flange section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of central hub through the complementary apertures of first reinforcing backing plate, spacers, discs and second reinforcing backing plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Distal end of connecting rods are secured against the outside face of second reinforcing backing plate by any suitable retaining means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Proximal end <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of connecting rods has a securing means that is seated in countersunk opening <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of flange section of central hub. Alternative embodiments may not require a countersunk configuration and include any operable configuration of the elements described herein. Retaining device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, such as a conventional nut threaded onto the distal end of the connecting rod, or any other suitable retaining device, is secured in such a manner as to draw second reinforcing backing plate towards proximal end of connecting rod, thereby drawing all components into tight association. Although the preferred embodiment described herein shows a through-bolt arrangement for connecting the sub-components of the impeller assembly, the present invention also anticipates the use of other similar connecting means, such as a stud-bolt arrangement for the connecting rods, having a threaded proximal and distal end, and a welded-stud arrangement, where the connecting rods are secured to the central hub and the second reinforcing backing plate by welded, soldered or brazed connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of impeller assembly, a support frame <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be provided at one end of the rods to secure the rods, as depicted by various embodiments in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. The support frame includes a rod attachment <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, wherein each rod attachment is for holding one of the rods. Where a central hub is included on one end of the array of stacked plates, the support frame may be secured to the opposite end of the array of plates. The support frame may be of various shapes and sizes in order to inhibit movement of the rods. Oftentimes, without the use of a support frame, the high fluid pressure may cause a non-secured end of the rods to shake or otherwise move its position. As a result, the spaces between the plates may vary with rod movement, affecting fluid flow. The support frame may permit more uniform spaces between plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a support frame <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having four rod attachments <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for supporting four rods. However, any number of rod attachments may be included, depending on the number of rods provided. Various types rod attachments may be employed, which inhibit movement of the rods, such as an opening through which a rod end, such as the distal end of connecting rods, is extended. The opening may permit the retaining device to draw the support frame towards proximal end of connecting rod, thereby drawing all components into tight association, rather than or in addition to securing a second reinforcing backing plate, as described above. The support frame also includes arms <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> coupled to the rods and that may connect to the rods in various patterns, such as a web, circle, square, triangular, etc. At least one arm end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is coupled to at least one rod attachment, and at times each arm end is coupled to a different rod attachment. In some embodiments that include a central shaft, the support frame may also include a shaft attachment <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as depicted in by the exemplary embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The shaft attachment may be connected to the rod attachments by arms <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that each may extend from the shaft attachment at a first arm end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and to each of the rod attachments at the other, i.e. second, arm end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Oftentimes, the components of the support frame are only as big as necessary to support the rods and/or shaft. For example, the rod and shaft attachments are slightly larger in diameter than the respective rods and shaft. Furthermore, the arms may also have a small diameter. This conservative size of the support frame may result in less disruption to fluid flow, e.g. turbulence, and/or require less material, than other designs that may employ a supporting plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The support frame is especially beneficial with embodiments of impeller assemblies that include a large array of stacked discs, such as having a large number of discs and/or spaces there between. The support frame is also useful for applications where the discs rotate very fast. The support frame may stabilize the discs to inhibit any discs from moving off center and/or flexing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Alignment of the central apertures of the two reinforcing backing plates and the stacked array of discs form a central cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> within the impeller assembly. Supporting the discs and backing plates at the inside perimeter eliminates the central shaft employed in previous designs, as well as the spokes used to attach the discs to the central shaft, thereby eliminating the turbulence created by the central shaft and associated spokes of the discs. Where a shaft does not extend past the first backing plate and into the central cavity, the central cavity may be devoid of a shaft. The central cavity permits the fluid to flow in a more natural line into the impeller assembly without the churning effect of the shaft and spokes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates the pump system with the inlet cover and second reinforcing backing plate removed to reveal the most distal disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the stacked array <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the pump system may be of any conventional design that provides a complimentary surface for the impeller assembly. The housing comprises an outer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and inner wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the housing body, forming an interior chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of sufficient volume to accommodate the impeller assembly, yet maintain a gap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> between the impeller assembly and the inside wall of the housing. The inner wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provides a complementary surface for the impeller system to draw against, and gap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> permits movement of the fluid within the housing and to create a zone of high pressure. The volume area defined by the gap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> affects flow rate and operating pressure. In certain embodiments, the total gap volume should be between 10 and 20% greater than the inlet volume area, but may be smaller or larger, depending on the application. Additional factors to be considered in determining the gap volume are output pressure, and sheer mass, viscosity and particulate size of the fluid medium. The pump housing further comprises a housing flange <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> with a series of holes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extending from the face plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the flange through to the underside <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the flange. The inner wall of the housing forms a fluid catch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by an inwardly angling extension of the wall to create a shoulder <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which is continuous with the inner wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of an outlet port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a central aperture <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The inner wall of the housing has an opening <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to permit fluid to flow through the central aperture <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the outlet port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments may utilize any conventional pump housing incorporating impeller assemblies of the present invention and not be limited to the exemplary embodiment presented herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The impeller assembly is oriented within the internal chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the housing by threading the receiving end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through a centrally oriented opening <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the bearing/seal assembly <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> such that the shaft section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the central hub is securely held and supported by the bearing/seal assembly. Bearing/seal assembly <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is integrated into the rear plate <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of the pump housing by conventional mechanisms. One possible configuration has the bearing/seal as a cartridge unit (although the bearing and seals may be separate units) that is press-fitted on to the shaft and then pressed into the housing, The bearing/seal assembly may be of any conventional configuration that will provide sufficient support for the impeller assembly, permit as friction-free radial movement of the shaft as possible and prevent any leaking of fluid from the internal chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The pump system is driven by any drive system capable of imparting rotational movement to the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the central hub, thereby imparting rotational movement to the entire impeller assembly within the internal cavity of the pump housing. The receiving end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the central hub may be of various configurations, such as keyed, flat, splined, and the like, to allow association with various motor systems. An exemplary embodiment depicts a standard shaft configuration, which has been keyed with a receiving notch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed at the receiving end of the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receiving a complementary retaining device associated with the drive system. Other examples include flex-joints, universal joints, flex-shafts, pulley systems, chain-drive, belt-drive, cog-belt-drive systems, direct-couple systems, and the like. Any drive system, such as a motor or comparable device, that directly or indirectly imparts radial movement to the impeller assembly through the shaft may be employed with the present invention. Suitable drive systems include motors of all types, in particular electrical, internal combustion, solar-driven, wind-driven, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The inlet port cover <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</cross-reference> has a circumference comparable to the circumference of housing flange <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and has a series of apertures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; that are spatially oriented to be complementary to apertures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in housing flange <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Inlet port cover <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is attached to the pump housing by securing inside face <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of inlet port cover <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to face plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of housing flange <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and fixedly attached by any conventional securing devices through complementary apertures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the context of the present invention, the term &ldquo;fixedly&rdquo; does not necessarily mean a permanent, non-detachable attachment or connection, but is meant to describe a variety of connections well known in the art that form tight, immovable junctions between components. Face plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of inlet port cover <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> defines the ceiling of internal chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the pump housing. Fluid is drawn into opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of inlet port <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and through inlet port conduit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to internal chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Operationally, internal chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the pump is primed with a fluid compatible to that being displaced. The drive system is activated to impart radial movement to shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, turning stacked array of discs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through the fluid medium in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Impeller assemblies of the present invention operate in either direction of rotation. As discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly are driven through the fluid medium, the fluid in immediate contact with viscous drag face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of discs is also rotated due to the strong adhesion forces between the fluid and disc. The fluid is subjected to two forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation, and the other centrifugally in an outward radial direction. The combined effects of these forces propels the fluid with continuously increasing velocity in a spiral path The fluid increases in velocity as it moves through the relatively narrow inter-disc spaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causing zones of negative pressure at the inter-disc spaces. The continued movement of the accelerating fluid from inside perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of discs to outside perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of discs further draws fluid from central cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly, which is essentially continuous with inlet port conduit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of inlet port <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The net negative pressure created within internal chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the pump draws fluid from an outside source connected by any conventional means to the inlet port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As fluid is accelerated through inter-disc spaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to outside perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the continued momentum drives the fluid against inner wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of housing chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> creating a zone of higher pressure defined by gap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> between outside perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and inner wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of housing chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The fluid is driven from the zone of relative high pressure to a zone of ambient pressure defined by outlet port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and any further connections to the system. The fluid within the system may circulate a number of times before being displaced through the outlet port. Fluid catch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of inner wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> serves to impel the flow of circulating fluid into the central aperture of the outlet port. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> An additional embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-D. The marine jet pump employs essentially the same impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> described above, and therefore attention should be drawn to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> and the corresponding written description for a detailed disclosure of the impeller assembly, associated components and systems, as well as principles of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional side view illustrating the arrangement of impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> within jet pump housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Jet pump housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material including cast and/or machined metals and/or metal alloys such as iron, steel, aluminum, titanium, and the like, as well as ceramics and plastics. Jet pump housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> possesses an exterior <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and interior wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which forms an internal chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of sufficient volume to accommodate impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and maintain a gap <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> between discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and backing plates <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly. In certain applications, gap <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is between from {fraction (1/100)} to greater than 2 inches, preferably from {fraction (1/32)} to 1 inch, and more preferably from {fraction (1/16)} to &frac12; inch, and in this exemplary embodiment, around &frac14; inch, depending on size and amount of particulates in the fluid medium. It is understood the gap may extend beyond this range for optimal performance under certain conditions for various embodiments of the invention. Shaft section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the impeller assembly is supported by a series of support bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> housed within a cavity <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> formed by support collar <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which is an extension of the jet pump housing. The floor of cavity <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> housing support bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed by a flange section <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> extending from interior wall or support collar <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Extending from flange section <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, is a lip <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, which provides a seat for a top seal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a bottom seal <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Bearing support assemblies <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are retained within support collar cavity <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> by a retaining ring <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, or comparable retaining device, fixedly associated with shaft section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thereby providing structural support to the impeller assembly. As previously noted, the bearing/seal assembly may be of any appropriate configuration that provides sufficient support and permit as friction-free radial movement of the shaft as possible, as well as prevent any leakage from the internal chamber. The seals utilized in the system may be of various configurations and compositions, so long as they are non-reactive and wear-resistant. Suitable materials include rubber, urethane, polyurethane, silicone, other synthetic materials, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The floor of internal chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is defined by a cover <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, having a bottom plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with a central aperture <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the central aperture of the bottom plate is roughly equivalent to the diameter of the central aperture of the backing plates and discs. Integral with the bottom plate is a cowl section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, having a grated section defining a grated inlet port <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The interior surface <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of bottom plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is recessed <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to accommodate distal ends <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of connecting rods <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and associated retaining mechanism <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This feature permits interior surface <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of bottom plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be in close association with outside face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the inlet-side backing plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, preferably in the range of {fraction (1/32)} to 2 or more inches and more preferably in the range of {fraction (1/16)} to 1 inch and even more preferably from &frac18; to &frac12; inch. Cover <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</cross-reference>) is fixedly attached to jet pump housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by any appropriate securing device, such as a bolt threaded through a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> formed in the flange section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the cover to complementary threaded apertures on the bottom plate. Alternative embodiments of the present invention may incorporate any conventional securing device or mechanism that serves the same purpose. Interior wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of cowl section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> forms an interior conduit <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> continuous with grated inlet port <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to permit fluid to pass from the external environment into the internal chamber of the marine jet housing. Inlet port <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is grated to screen out undesirable material from entering the internal chamber of the jet pump. Inlet port may be covered with any appropriate device that serves to screen out undesirable material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The marine jet pump employs many of the same principles of operation as the pump system described above. As with the pump system, various connections or associations between the drive system and the marine jet pump, as well as various drive systems are envisioned. In operation, the marine jet pump is partially submersed in a fluid medium and primed to remove air from the system. The drive system is activated to impart radial movement to shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of central hub <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, turning stacked array of discs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through the fluid medium in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. As discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly are driven through the fluid medium, the fluid in immediate contact with viscous drag face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of discs is also rotated due to the strong adhesion forces between the fluid and disc. The continued movement of the accelerating fluid from inside perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the discs to outside perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the discs further draws fluid from central cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly. The net negative pressure created within internal chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the marine jet pump continuously draws fluid through grated inlet port <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of cover <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through interior conduit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and aperture of the bottom plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to central cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As fluid is accelerated through the inter-disc spaces to the outside perimeter of the discs, the continued momentum drives the fluid against the inner wall of the housing chamber creating a zone of higher pressure defined by the gap between the outside perimeter of the discs and the inner wall of the housing chamber. The fluid within the system may circulate a number of times before being displaced through the outlet port. Fluid catch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the inner wall serves to impel the flow of circulating fluid into the central aperture of the outlet port. The fluid is driven from the zone of relative high pressure <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, as previously described above, to a zone of ambient pressure defined by outlet port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and any further connections to the system. The exhausted fluid is preferably attached to a standard directional nozzle, or comparable device, to direct the fluid stream into the surrounding water supplying the propulsive force for the marine craft. Alternatively, the present invention may also be fitted with any suitable power head to optimize performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The present invention also envisions various modifications to the design presented herein, including one or more inlet and/or outlet ports located at different locations on the jet pump, whether on the front, sides, or bottom of the jet pump housing. Furthermore, the present invention may be mounted to the hull of the vessel in any suitable location at any appropriate angle for optimal performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The exemplary description for a marine jet pump is merely illustrative of one of many possible embodiments of a jet system. It is understood that jet systems, as well as any system that drives fluid, such as fluid circulating systems, incorporating impeller assemblies of the present invention are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> 3. Impeller Assembly in the Context of a Turbine System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A hydroelectric turbine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> employing a modified version of the inventive impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-D. The turbine operates under the same general principles of operation as previously described for the pump, but in reverse. Many of the design features of the impeller assembly described above are equally applicable to the turbine embodiments and are therefore incorporated herein, where appropriate. There are distinct differences in the method of operation between pump and turbine systems, although the same basic design of the impeller assembly is utilized. For example, in the pump, the centrifugal and tangential forces imparted to the fluid medium are additive resulting in greater head pressure, which facilitates the expulsion of the fluid medium from the exhaust port. In contrast, the centrifugal forces in the turbine are in opposition to the tangential or dynamic forces of the fluid medium, thereby reducing the effective head pressure and velocity of radial flow to the center of the impeller assembly. As a result, the efficiency of the turbine generally benefits from having a greater number of discs and smaller inter-disc spaces in the impeller assembly, as compared to the pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Hydroelectric turbine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises an impeller assembly contained within a housing comprising several sub-components. The housing may be machined, cast, or a combination of both, and made of any suitable material well known in the art, and in particular, the materials previously mentioned. Integral with the housing is a penstock <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which surrounds the housing and impeller assembly. The housing is comprised of a top cover <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having a support collar section <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and a flange section <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The interior of the upper portion of the support collar section <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> forms the bearing housing for supporting the shaft of the impeller assembly. One or more bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> are restrictively retained within the bearing housing by interior face <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the upper portion of the support collar section, which is in immediate contact with exterior face <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of bearing assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Extending inwardly from the interior face of support collar section <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is a first rim <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, forming the seat of the bearing housing. Integral with first rim <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and interior face <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the support collar is a second rim <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, which serves as a support for the seal assemblies <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. Alternative designs may employ bushings and bushing-bearing combinations, as well as other comparable assemblies and mechanisms well known in the art. Shaft section <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly is supported by compressive forces exerted by bearing assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and support collar <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of the housing. This particular arrangement permits low friction radial movement of the impeller assembly while restricting lateral and horizontal movement. The present invention also envisions employing any other conventional apparatus well known in the art to achieve the same results. The upper section of the shaft, distal from the receiving end <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of shaft, possesses an outwardly extending ring section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> whose bottom shoulder <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is in tight association with seal assembly <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, which is in tight association with the top of bearing assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, thereby holding the bearing assembly in tight association against seat <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> of bearing housing. The present invention also envisions any conventional retaining assemblies and mechanisms known in the art for retaining the bearing assemblies other than the ring or collar extending from the body of the impeller shaft, such as a retaining or compression ring fixedly associated with the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Interior surface <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of flange section <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of top cover defines the top section of an upper labyrinth seal <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, which has a first series of grooves <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> formed therein. Interior surface <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of the top cover <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> also forms the ceiling of an internal chamber <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> within the turbine housing which houses the impeller assembly. The side wall of the internal chamber <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is defined by a plurality of wicket gates <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and structural rim <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of upper body <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of penstock <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Wicket gates <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> are pivotably connected to the housing, to permit movement around a central axis. The floor of internal chamber <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is defined by interior surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of structural rim <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of lower body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of penstock <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Interior surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of structural rim <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of lower body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is recessed <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> to accommodate the impeller assembly. Interior surface of recessed section <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> has a second series of grooves <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> formed therein to define bottom section <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the lower labyrinth seal. Other configurations of labyrinth seals, or other seal assemblies, well known in the art which restrict intrusion of fluid are envisioned by the present invention. For example, there may be a greater or a fewer number of ridges and grooves, or one or more ridges per groove depending on the specific requirements of the particular application. Extending from structural rim <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of lower body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of penstock <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is a conduit section <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, the interior of which forms exhaust port <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The impeller assembly previously described has several modifications to the sub-components to adapt it for use in a hydroelectric turbine. In particular, the central hub comprises two components, the straight shaft section <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> fixedly attached to a hub-plate <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>. The hub-plate has a support collar section <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> having an interior wall <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> forming a cavity to receive the connecting end <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> of the shaft. The shaft section may be fixedly joined to the hub-plate by any conventional means to form a tight association, including threaded, welded, keyed, splined, bolted, press-fitted and/or compression connections, and the like. Alternatively, the shaft and the hub-plate may be cast and/or machined as one integral piece. Extending from the collar section of the hub-plate, is the top reinforcing backing plate section <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> with a top surface <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> that is recessed to form the bottom section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the upper labyrinth seal. The bottom section of the upper labyrinth seal has a first plurality of raised ridges <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> that fit into the complementary first set of grooves <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the top section of the upper labyrinth seals <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. This configuration, as well as similar configurations, and other seal means well known in the art, serve to restrict the movement of fluid beyond the seal, thereby keeping more fluid flowing over the discs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the present invention. The modified impeller assembly of the hydroelectric turbine shares the same configuration of discs, spacers, connecting rods, etc as previously described. The aforementioned components for the hydroelectric turbine undergo may require different dimensions and stronger materials to accommodate the greater mechanical stress of the system, but generally, the discs and other components may be of any suitable dimensions. For example, the discs may have a thickness in the range of 0.5 to 40 mm, preferably 1 to 25 mm and more preferably, 2 to 20 mm, and a diameter of 5 to 10,000 mm, preferably, 10 to 5,000 mm and more preferably, 20 to 2,500 mm. In general, the hub-plate is four times thicker than the main discs, although this relationship may vary to accommodate particular applications. Compared to the pump impeller design, the turbine design is more generally more efficient with relatively more discs placed closer together. For example, a typical turbine may have 4 or greater than 40 discs per impeller assembly with an inter-disc spacing of preferably from {fraction (1/100)} to greater than 2 inches, more preferably from {fraction (1/32)} to 1 inch, and most preferably from {fraction (1/16)} to &frac12; inch, and in the exemplary embodiment presented herein, in the range of &frac18; to &frac12; inch, or as required by the particular demands of the specific application. The inlet side backing plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described in the previous embodiments has been replaced with a bottom reinforcing/labyrinth seal plate <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The lower face <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of the bottom reinforcing/labyrinth seal plate has a second plurality of raised ridges that are fit into the complementary grooves <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of the bottom section of the lower labyrinth seal, forming the lower labyrinth seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Penstock <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> portion of the housing is formed by fixedly joining, by any conventional means, upper body <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and lower body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to define a chamber encircling the impeller assembly and associated structural components. The upper and lower bodies of the penstock each have an interior surface <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> continuous with the other to form an interior conduit <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. Interior surface of the penstock <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> extends outwardly to create a fluid inlet port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which may be connected to any additional components for bringing fluid to the inlet port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In operation, fluid having sufficient velocity enters fluid inlet port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and fills interior conduit <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> of penstock <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, creating a zone of high pressure. As fluid pressure increases within the fluid conduit, the fluid is forced through wicket gates <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and into internal chamber <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of the housing. Wicket gates <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> are operated by a controlling mechanism, such as a shifting ring <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, which serves as a means of controlling the flow of the fluid into the internal chamber of the housing, and therefore the speed and output of the turbine. Shifting ring <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> is connected to the vertical section <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of the wicket gate by any conventional connecting assembly <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. Rotational speed of the turbine may be regulated by controlling the volume of fluid flowing through the impeller assembly, as well as the angle at which the pressurized fluid contacts the impeller assembly. To control the volume of fluid, the wicket gates are regulated to adjust the volume of fluid entering the internal chamber of the housing. Regulation of the wicket gates is by a shifting ring, or any other conventional mechanism, which may be controlled by a centrifugal governor. The centrifugal governor is connected to the shifting ring by conventional devices and may be actuated by any suitable controlling mechanism, such as, but not limited to, mechanical and electrical devices, for example, a servomotor and servomechanism. The centrifugal governor is engaged as the turbine reaches a select rotational speed, which in turn rotates the shifting ring adjusting the wicket gates and thereby regulating the volume of fluid and consequently the rotational speed of the turbine. The present invention also envisions employing other conventional controlling mechanism well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As the fluid passes into the internal chamber, the pressurized fluid encounters the impeller assembly. The tortuous path of the upper and lower labyrinth seals creates a physical obstacle to the fluid, causing the fluid to preferentially move across the discs of the impeller assembly. With reference to the previous description of the discs of the impeller assembly, moving fluid initially contacts outside perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of discs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>), moves across the viscous drag face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to inside perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and through central aperture <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of impeller assembly. The fluid continues to flow from regions of high to low pressure until eventually expelled from exhaust port <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. As the fluid moves across the discs, energy is transferred to the impeller assembly through the friction of the fluid in immediate contact with the face of the discs in combination with the adhesive forces of the fluid, causing a continuously decreasing velocity in the fluid. The energy transferred to the discs from the moving fluid is predominantly in the form of tangential or dynamic forces imparted to the discs, which cause the entire impeller assembly to rotate around its central axis. The bearing assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> supports the shaft of the impeller assembly and permits rotational movement of the shaft <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> with a minimum of non-rotational movement. The receiving end of the shaft <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> may be connected by any conventional means known in the art to any number of mechanical devices for utilizing or applying the rotational movement produced thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> A fluid turbine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> employing a modified version of the inventive impeller assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-C. The fluid turbine comprises an impeller assembly contained within a main housing <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> comprising several sub-components. The general design and principles of operation of the impeller assembly has been previously described and, where applicable, are incorporated into the description of this embodiment of the present invention. For example, in some embodiments, the impeller assembly includes a central hub, and a stacked array of parallel discs, each disc having a central aperture and being inter-spaced along a parallel axis. The main housing has a narrower support collar section <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which houses one or more bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> that support the shaft <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The main housing has a bell-shaped section <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> continuous with collar support section <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. A structural brace section <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> connects the two sections of the main housing described above. The interior of the upper portion of the support collar section of the top cover defines the bearing housing <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> for supporting the shaft of the impeller assembly. One or more bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> are restrictively retained within bearing housing <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> by interior face <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of the upper portion of the support collar section, which is in immediate contact with an exterior face <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of bearing assembly <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Extending inwardly from interior face <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of the support collar section is a first rim <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, forming the seat of the bearing housing. Integral with first rim <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and interior face <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of support collar is a second rim <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which serves as a seal support surface. Shaft section <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly is supported by the compressive forces exerted by the bearing assembly and support collar of the housing. This arrangement permits low friction radial movement of the impeller assembly while restricting lateral and horizontal movement. The upper section of the shaft, distal from the receiving end <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the shaft, possesses a retaining device, such as a retaining ring <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> whose bottom shoulder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is in tight association with the top of bearing assembly <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, thereby holding bearing assembly against seat <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> of bearing housing <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The present invention also envisions other retaining means for holding the bearing assemblies other than the retaining ring, such as a compression ring fixedly associated with the shaft. The present invention may also employ any conventional retaining devices known in the art, including, but not limited to, a sir clip, locking bolt, snap ring, taper lock and press fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Interior surface <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of bell section <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of main housing forms the top section of the upper labyrinth seal <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, which has a first series of grooves <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> formed therein. Interior surface of the top cover also defines the ceiling and sides of an internal chamber <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> within the main housing which houses the impeller assembly. The floor of the internal chamber is defined by interior surface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of end cover <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, which has a second series of grooves <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> formed therein to create the bottom section of the lower labyrinth seal <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Other configurations of labyrinth seals or other seal mechanisms for restricting the intrusion of fluid well known in the art are envisioned by the present invention. Extending from the end cover is a conduit section <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, which defines the exhaust port <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The impeller assembly for the fluid turbine has several modifications to the sub-components. In particular, the central hub comprises two components, the straight shaft section <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> fixedly attached to a hub <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. An alternative design may employ a hub-plate design as described in the hydroelectric turbine embodiment described above. The hub has a support collar section <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> having an interior wall <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> forming a cavity to receive the connecting end <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> of the shaft. The shaft section may be joined to the hub by any conventional means to form a tight association, including threaded, welded, brazed, soldered, bonded, compression connections and the like. Alternatively, the shaft and the hub may be cast and/or machined as one integral piece, or may be machined or cast sub-components, as well as any combination of the above. The interior face of the hub <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is in tight association with the outside face the top reinforcing backing plate section <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight>. The outside face of the top reinforcing backing plate extending beyond the hub has a first series of raised grooves <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to form the bottom section <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of the upper labyrinth seal. First series of raised ridges <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> fit into complementary first set of grooves <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the top section of upper labyrinth seals <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. This configuration, as well as similar configurations, and other sealing mechanisms well known in the art, serve to restrict the movement of fluid beyond the seal, thereby keeping more fluid flowing over the discs and out the exhaust port. The modified impeller assembly of the fluid turbine shares the same configuration of discs, spacers, connecting rods, etc as previously described. The aforementioned components for the fluid turbine may require different dimensions and stronger materials to accommodate the greater mechanical stresses of the system. In general, the number of discs, disc dimensions and inter-disc spacing described above apply for the present embodiment, although due to the unique physical attributes of fluid, the inter-disc spacing may be in the range of {fraction (1/100)} to several inches, preferably {fraction (1/64)} to 2 inches and more preferably {fraction (1/16)} to &frac12; inch. The inlet side backing plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described in previous embodiments has been replaced with a bottom reinforcing/labyrinth seal plate <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. Lower face <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> of bottom reinforcing/labyrinth seal plate <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> has a second plurality of raised ridges <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> that fit into complementary grooves <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the bottom section of the lower labyrinth seal, forming the lower labyrinth seal. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, an end cover <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to a flange section <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the main housing by any conventional devices known in the art, including, but not limited to, the nut and bolt arrangement depicted in the illustration. In addition, any conventional methods of sealing the end cover to the main housing are envisioned, such as gaskets, O-rings and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The main housing of the fluid turbine has a plurality of reversing nozzle housings <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> that are integral with the bell-shaped portion <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of the main housing, such that the interior of the reversing nozzle housings are open to the internal chamber <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> of the main housing. The openings of the reversing nozzle housings serve as a series of inlets for the fluid. A plurality of reversing nozzles <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>) are set into a complementary plurality of reversing nozzle housings <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> by means of a mounting post <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> that is pivotally mounted into the base of reversing nozzle housing <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the reversing nozzles defines a conduit having a series of slots <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> through which fluid is directed. A controlling mechanism, such as a shifting ring <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, or other device, regulates the reversing nozzles. In this particular embodiment, the reversing nozzles are rotated by means of a shifting ring <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. Shifting ring <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to an arm portion of the cap <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> of reversing nozzles by any conventional means; for example, a bolt assembly through an aperture in cap <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> and a complementary aperture in the shifting ring. The reversing nozzles are arranged in the reversing nozzle housings such that the slots may be exposed to the impeller assembly within the internal chamber of the housing by turning the shifting ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A fluid source is connected by any conventional device to fluid inlet conduit <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, having a plurality of fluid supply conduits <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> branching to, and connecting with, reversing nozzles. In operation, fluid of sufficient pressure is channeled into the fluid inlet conduit, where it is directed to supply conduits <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> and into the reversing nozzles. To engage the impeller assembly, the shifting ring is turned to adjust the reversing nozzles to align the complementary slots of each nozzle with the internal chamber of the main housing. The fluid is forced through the slots into the internal chamber and where the fluid contacts the impeller assembly. The tortuous path of the upper and lower labyrinth seals creates a physical obstacle to the fluid, causing the fluid to preferentially move across the discs of the impeller assembly. The pressurized fluid initially contacts outside perimeter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the discs (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>), moves across viscous drag face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to inside perimeter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and through the central aperture <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly. The fluid continues to flow from regions of high to low pressure until eventually expelled from exhaust port <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. As the fluid moves across the discs, energy is transferred to the impeller assembly through the friction of the fluid in immediate contact with the face of the discs in combination with the adhesive forces of the fluid, causing a continuously decreasing velocity in the fluid as it moves to the inside perimeter of the discs. The energy transferred to the discs from the moving fluid is predominantly in the form of tangential and rotational forces imparted to the discs, which cause the entire impeller assembly to rotate around its central axis. Bearing assembly <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> supports the shaft of the impeller assembly and permits rotational movement of the shaft <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> with a minimum of non-rotational movement. Receiving end of the shaft <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> may be connected by any conventional mechanisms known in the art to any number of mechanical devices for utilizing or applying the rotational movement produced thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The reversing nozzles serve to regulate the speed, torque and direction of rotation of the turbine. In the preferred embodiment, the reversing nozzles have two slots, although additional slots and arrangements of slots may be used. The turbine is capable of reversing direction depending on which of the slots are aligned with the central chamber. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the slots are opened to direct the fluid at various angles less than perpendicular to the discs of the impeller assembly, thereby imparting rotational movement in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>. To reverse the direction of the turbine, the shifting ring is turned to rotate the reversing nozzles and thereby align the opposite slots of the reversing nozzles with the internal chamber of the housing. The fluid is thereby directed in an opposite direction as previously described and imparts rotational movement of the impeller assembly counter to the arrow. The torque and rotational speed of the impeller assembly is controlled by adjusting the slots of the reversing nozzles relative to the discs of the impeller assembly. As the reversing nozzles are turned, the relative angle of the streaming fluid from the slots varies in relation to the discs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). As the fluid contacts the discs at a more tangential angle, the turbine has less rotational speed, but greater torque, and when the streaming fluid contacts the discs at a more perpendicular angle, the turbine has greater rotational speed and less torque. As a result, the rotational speed can be finely adjusted by varying the angle of the streaming fluid relative to the discs by rotating the reversing nozzles. The fluid travels across the discs to the central cavity of the impeller assembly and eventually to the exhaust port <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, where it is expelled. The shifting ring may be turned to close both slots of the reversing nozzles to the internal chamber and consequently stop the turbine altogether. In addition, the shifting ring, or comparable device, may be controlled by any suitable means, including manually or mechanically, as well as work in association with regulating devices that monitor speed and direction and provide a reporting signal to controlling mechanisms to mechanically adjust the shifting ring and nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> 4. Impeller Assembly in the Context of a Transmission System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A turbine transmission <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, comprises a turbine section <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, a sump assembly <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a pump section <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and a high pressure line <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The aforementioned subsystems are combined to form one closed system through which a fluid medium flows. Many of the features of the sub-components of the turbine transmission have been described in the detailed description of the pump system and the fluid turbine, and therefore those figures and detailed descriptions are incorporated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Operationally, the turbine transmission is filled with a suitable fluid medium and devoid of any air. A drive system is activated to impart radial movement to the shaft <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of the central hub <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, turning the stacked array of discs <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> through the fluid medium. As the discs of the impeller assembly are driven through the fluid medium, the fluid in immediate contact with the viscous drag face of the discs is also rotated due to the strong adhesion forces between the fluid and disc. As previously described, the fluid is subjected to two forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation, and the other centrifugally in an outward radial direction. The combined effects of these forces propels the fluid with continuously increasing velocity in a spiral path. The fluid increases in velocity as it moves through the narrow inter-disc spaces causing zones of negative pressure at the inter-disc spaces. The continued movement of the accelerating fluid from the inside perimeter of the discs to the outside perimeter of the discs further draws fluid from the central cavity of the impeller assembly, which is continuous with the inlet port conduit of the inlet port. The net negative pressure created within the internal chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of the pump section continuously draws fluid from the inlet conduit leading from the sump <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and connected, by any conventional means <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, to the inlet port <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the pump section <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As fluid is accelerated through the inter-disc spaces to the outside perimeter of the discs, the continued momentum drives the fluid against the inner wall of the housing chamber creating a zone of higher pressure defined by the gap between the outside perimeter of the discs and the inner wall of the housing chamber. The fluid is driven from the zone of relative high pressure to a zone of relatively lower pressure defined by the outlet port <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and the high pressure line <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> connected thereto (as illustrated by the arrows). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The pressurized fluid is driven through the high pressure line to the fluid inlet line <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and to the branching supply lines <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, which connect to the cap sections of the reversing nozzles <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, as previously described in the turbine embodiment. To engage the impeller assembly, the shifting ring <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> is turned to adjust the reversing nozzles to align the complementary slots <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of each nozzle with the internal chamber <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight> of the turbine housing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The fluid is forced through the slots into the internal chamber and contacts the impeller assembly. The tortuous path of the upper <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> labyrinth seals creates a physical obstacle to the fluid, causing it to preferentially move across the discs <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly. The pressurized fluid initially contacts the outside perimeter of the discs, moves across the viscous drag face of the discs to the inside perimeter, and through the central aperture of the impeller assembly. The fluid continues to flow from regions of high to low pressure until eventually expelled from the exhaust port <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. As the fluid moves across the discs, energy is transferred to the impeller assembly through the friction of the fluid in immediate contact with the face of the discs in combination with the adhesive forces of the fluid, causing a continuously decreasing velocity in the fluid as it moves to the inside perimeter of the discs. The energy transferred to the discs from the moving fluid is predominantly in the form of tangential and rotational forces imparted to the discs, which cause the entire impeller assembly to rotate around its central axis. The bearing assembly <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> supports the shaft <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> of the impeller assembly and permits rotational movement of the shaft with a minimum of non-rotational movement. The receiving end of the shaft <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> may be connected by any conventional means known in the art to any number of mechanical devices for utilizing or applying the rotational movement produced thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As described above, the reversing nozzles serve to regulate the speed, torque and direction of rotation of the turbine. The turbine is capable of reversing direction depending on which of the slots are aligned with the central chamber. The torque and rotational speed of the impeller assembly is controlled by adjusting the slots of the reversing nozzles relative to the discs of the impeller assembly. As the reversing nozzles are turned, the relative angle of the streaming fluid from the slots varies in relation to the discs, thereby controlling rotational speed and torque. The shifting ring can be turned to close both slots of the reversing nozzles to the internal chamber and consequently stop the turbine, and therefore, the transmission completely. In addition, the shifting ring, or comparable device, may be controlled by any suitable means, including manually or mechanically, as well as work in association with regulating devices that monitor speed and direction and provide a reporting signal to controlling mechanisms to mechanically adjust the shifting ring and nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The fluid is driven across the discs of the turbine to the central cavity of the impeller assembly and eventually driven out the exhaust port <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and on through the outlet conduit <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> connected by any conventional means <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight> to the sump <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The fluid expelled from the turbine is driven into the sump where it is recycled. The fluid is eventually drawn back into the pump section, where the cycle repeats itself. The drive mechanism applying rotational movement to the impeller assembly of the pump section drives the fluid to impart rotational movement of the impeller assembly of the turbine section thereby providing complementary rotational movement at the turbine&apos;s shaft, which may be utilized in any number of ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> 5. Impeller Assembly in the Context of a Fuel Turbine System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of fuel turbine employing a modified version of the inventive impeller assembly is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-D. The fuel turbine operates under the same general principles of operation as previously described for the various embodiments of the turbines described above, such as the turbine transmission, but adapted to ignite fuel and thereby create power. Many of the design features of the impeller assemblies described above are equally applicable to the turbine embodiments and are therefore incorporated herein, where appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In general, as depicted by one embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the fuel turbine includes a compressor section to create high pressure fluid, a power section to ignite fuel and increase pressure and/or a gear section to transfer rotational power. The illustration shows one embodiment of fuel turbine <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> having a compressor impeller section <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> in fluidic communication with a power impeller section <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> by a transfer link <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and a gear section <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> in mechanical communication with the compressor section and power section by a main shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. However, other embodiments may include a compressor impeller section according to the present invention in connection with a conventional power section or a conventional compressor section in connection with a power impeller section according to the present invention. Furthermore, the sections of the fuel turbine may be interconnected or in communication by a variety of components and positions, in addition to those described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The compressor impeller section <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> comprises a fluid intake port <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to feed flowing fluid, depicted as arrow A, such as air or other fluids to ignite fuel, to a compressor turbine <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. The compressor turbine <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> increases the pressure of the fluid. Similar to the pump described above, the centrifugal and tangential forces imparted to the fluid medium in the compressor turbine are additive resulting in greater head pressure, which facilitates the expulsion of the fluid medium from a fluid output <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> in fluidic communication with one or more transfer link(s) <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The transfer link may be various fluid linking structures, such as a tube, conduit, passageway, etc. that permits the fluid to travel to the power section. Movement of the fluid through the transfer link may occur by building of high pressure fluid in the fluid output <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The power impeller section <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> comprises a fluid inlet <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> to receive the released high pressure fluid from the transfer link <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The fluid inlet is attached to or otherwise in fluidic communication with a combustor unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> to permit the high pressure unit to enter the combustor unit. In some embodiments, the fluid inlet may be one or more, e.g. a plurality, of openings in the combustor unit. Furthermore, a fuel inlet <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is included to provide fuel, depicted as flow arrow B, to the combustor unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. The fuel may be chosen from any convenient combustible fluid for the particular application of the fuel turbine. For example, the fuel may be hydrogen, gasoline, propane, natural gas, combinations thereof, or the like. The combustor unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> also may be various combustors to ignite fuel and create very high pressure fluid which is known or may be currently known or developed in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A power turbine <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> receives the very high pressure fluid that has been ignited and creates rotational energy. As described above with regard to the turbines, tangential or dynamic forces of the fluid medium are transferred to rotational energy across a series of discs. The power turbine transfers the rotational energy to the main shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the gear section <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> thereby causing the main shaft to rotate. The rotational force of the main shaft may be transferred to the compressor turbine to cause rotation of an array of discs. In some embodiments, the main shaft is in mechanical communication, such as through one or more gears that may be contained in a gear housing <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, to an output shaft <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> to output the rotational power, depicted by output arrow D. An exhaust port <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is also provided to permit fluid, depicted as flow arrow C, to exit from the power turbine after the rotational energy is produced. In some embodiments, a starter <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is also provided to initiate rotational movement of the central hub of the compressor section, such as by rotation of the main shaft, and thereby to activate the compressor turbine. The starter may activate the compressor section prior to the power section perpetuating rotational movement in the main shaft. The starter may transfer rotational energy received from external mechanical sources, depicted as input arrow E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Some additional components that may be included in the compressor impeller section <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are depicted in the exploded view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. An end housing <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> may define the fluid intake port <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) to permit fluid to enter the compressor turbine to a central cavity <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> in an array of parallel discs <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> of the compressor turbine. In some embodiments, the main shaft (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) may extend through the array of discs and a shaft securing mechanism <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>, such as one or more bearings, may be provided in end housing <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> to retain and support an end of the main shaft. Furthermore, the shaft securing mechanism <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> may be protected from inflowing fluid and other environmental elements by a cover <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, such as a cap. In other embodiments, the main shaft may not extend through the central cavity <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> and an end of the main shaft may be fixedly secured to a central hub <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. In any case, the central cavity is usually devoid of any protruding components, such as parts having abrupt edges, rough textures, and the like, that may cause turbulence or otherwise disrupt the flow of fluid through the central cavity. An extending main shaft, where provided, is usually smooth without attachment components present in the central cavity, thereby permitting smooth flow of fluid through the cavity passed the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The array of discs <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> may be the same or similar to the disc array described above with regards to the impeller assembly. Oftentimes, in fuel turbine applications, the discs may be thicker in dimension than the discs used in non-fuel impeller applications. The thicker dimension may permit the discs to be rigid under the very high rotational speeds that may occur. This high rotational speed may be, for example, between 15,000 to 35,00 rpm compared to 450 to 10,000 rpm that may occur with non-fuel applications. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the discs may be comprised of a rigid and light material, such as titanium, ceramic, etc. Because of the flex resistant characteristic of these stronger plates, first and/or second backing plates may be not be necessary and may be excluded from this embodiment of turbine. However, it is also intended that in other embodiments of the present invention first and/or second backing plates may be included as described above. The number of discs and spacing may be determined in relation to the type of fuel used and application of the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The compressor turbine may also include two or more rods <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> extending through the discs, as described above with regard to the impeller assembly. A support frame <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> may be provided to support the end of the rods that is opposite of the end of the rods supported by the central hub <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. One or more retaining device(s) <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight>, such as a nut, may secure the rod ends against the support frame. Where the shaft extends through the array of disc, the support frame may also include a shaft attachment as described above with regards to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. In embodiments where the shaft does not pass through the discs, the support frame may not include a shaft attachment. The support frame may be separated from the discs by one or more spacer(s) <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight>. A hub nut <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> or other such securing mechanism, may also be provided to secure the central hub <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A compressor housing <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight> is provided to contain the compressor turbine, including the discs, rods, central hub, support frame and/or shaft. The compressor housing often includes one or more fluid output <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> that may collect high pressure fluid from across the discs and that may be in communication with a transfer link. The end housing <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the compressor housing <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight> by a bolt <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> or other such securing mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Various securing and supporting mechanisms may also be provided to couple the compressor section to the gear section and/or power section. These mechanisms may also provide for support for the main shaft, gears, etc. of the gear section. For example, a support bearing housing <highlight><bold>576</bold></highlight> may contain one or more bearings <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight> that may be separated by one or more spacers <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Some additional components that may be included in the power impeller section <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are depicted in the exploded view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. Various securing and supporting mechanisms may be provided to couple the power section to the gear section and/or compressor section. These mechanisms may also provide for support for the main shaft, gears, etc. of the gear section. For example, a support bearing housing <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> may contain one or more bearings <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, which may be separated by one or more spacers <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A combustor housing <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> contains a combustor unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) to accept high pressure fluid from the transfer link of the compressor section and expose the fluid to fuel, thereby causing ignition of the fuel. The combustor housing <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> also includes in an array of parallel discs <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> of the power turbine having a central cavity <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. The discs and the central cavity accept the ignited fuel source that is under very high pressure. The discs and central cavity may be the same or similar to the discs and central cavity of the compressor turbine described above. Furthermore, two or more rods <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> may extend through the array of discs and attached to a central hub <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> at one end of the rods, as described for the compressor section. The central hub may be fixedly attached to the array of discs by a securing mechanism <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, such as a nut or bolt. The rods may be supported at their other end by a support frame <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, which may be spaced from the array of discs by one or more spacers <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and secured by one or more securing mechanisms <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> such as a nut. In addition, the main shaft may either extend through the central hub and central cavity <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> or only extend to the central hub and the central cavity is devoid of such a shaft. An end housing <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> defines an exhaust port <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) to release the ignited fluid leaving the discs. </paragraph>

A gear reduction housing <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> may contain one or more of the shafts, or portions thereof, gears and various of the securing mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The main shaft <highlight><bold>666</bold></highlight> that extends from the compressor section to the power section may include a main gear <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight>. The main gear may be coupled to one or more reduction gear(s) <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>, which may, in turn, be coupled to an output shaft <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, a starter shaft <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> may be provided to initiate rotation of the main shaft. The starter shaft <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> may be in mechanical communication with the main shaft <highlight><bold>666</bold></highlight> through one or more gears, such as the reduction gear <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>, main gear <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight>, etc. Through the rotation of the main shaft, the starter shaft may initiate radial movement of the central hub of the compressor section, and thereby resulting in radial movement of the discs of the compressor section. Oftentimes, the starter shaft is coupled to a starter source located external or internal to the fuel turbine. The starter shaft <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> may be secured to the gear reduction housing by one or more bearings <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> spaced apart by one ore more spacers <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> and by a rethiner <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> An end plate <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight> and/or extension housing <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> may also contain one or more of the shafts. For example, end plate <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the gear reduction housing <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> by securing mechanisms <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight>, such as bolts and the extension housing <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the end plate.

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The types and numbers of shafts, gears, housings and securing mechanisms may be chosen depending, inter alia, the desired design, shape and size of the turbine and its particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In operation, the central hub of the compressor section is made to rotate to activate the compressor section, such as by the main shaft rotating by a starter. The central hub radial movement results in the discs of the array of stacked discs also radially moving. A fluid entering from the fluid intake port flows through the central apertures of the stacked array of discs forming the central cavity and through the spaces between the discs. Fluid flowing across the discs creates increases the pressure of the fluid. The high pressure fluid is released from the fluid outlet and travels through the transfer link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Further, fuel is exposed to the high pressure fluid at the power section and the fuel is ignited in the combustion unit. Upon ignition of the fuel, a very high pressure fluid flows across the stacked array of discs in the power section. A shaft is rotated by the fluid flowing across the discs. In some embodiments that includes an output shaft, rotation of the main shaft results in the output shaft rotating. In other embodiments, the main shaft outputs the rotational energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> There are many benefits to the fuel turbine according to the present invention that may be useful in various applications that are fuel driven. The fuel turbine may create a great amount of power, e.g. between about 50 to 5000 horse power. For example, the coupling of components as described above may permit simple dismantling of components, such as for repair of the turbine system. This easy field-strippable aspect of the turbine may not require specialized repair tools or expertise and thus, the turbine may be suitable for use in vehicles and similar transportation means. The turbine may also be compact in size, permitting its use in a variety of small and large devices. In addition, the fuel turbine of the present invention provides minimal turbulence in fluid flow and rattling of parts and thereby typically does not make great noise, especially in high frequencies, that is common of some other previous and current fuel turbine devices. Any sound created by the combustion of fuel is usually a small amount and at low frequency, which may be easily muzzled. Thus, the present fuel turbine may be suitable in applications where noise pollution is a consideration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Comparison of Viscous Drag Pump with Conventional Vane-Type Pump in Pumping Viscous Fluid </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A direct comparison of a standard pump, which utilized a typical rotor assembly with vanes, was tested against the present invention. Two identical &frac18; horsepower 3650 rpm motors were fitted with different impeller assemblies. Pump A possessed a conventional vane-type rotor assembly, and pump B possessed the viscous drag impeller assembly. To determine the comparative efficiency of the two types of pumps, the amount of waste oil pumped over time was monitored. The standard pump was unable to transfer the waste oil and was shown to severely overheat during the course of the trial. In contrast, the pump utilizing the viscous drag assembly was able to circulate the oil without strain on the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> To facilitate circulation of the viscous fluid and thereby compare the relative efficiency of the two pump designs, the waste oil was heated to 140 F. The pump equipped with the viscous drag assembly was able to transfer three gallons/minute in contrast to only one gallon/minute for the standard pump. </paragraph>
