<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the physical layout of the communication interface architecture for an interconnect system, and more particularly, to a mid-connect architecture with point-to-point connections for high speed data transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Standards have been established for the architecture of the hardware employed to enable the exchange of electrical signals among processing devices. The processing devices include integrated circuit systems built on and using printed circuit boards by an increasingly wide array of suppliers. The architecture standards ensure that the various devices will, in fact, be able to communicate with one another as well as with central processing units that control the operation of such peripheral devices. These peripherals include, but are not limited to, printer interfaces, video, audio, and graphics interfaces, memory, external communications interfaces, or any other sort of discrete device performing particular computer-related functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The circuit boards associated with the peripherals may be activated upon connection with a primary printed circuit board, such as a motherboard, that establishes the physical interconnection of the central processing unit, power, memory structures, and the peripherals through an interconnection structure. The interconnection structure is a primary communication interface coupling device having connections to one or more slots or sockets in parallel into which circuit boards may be inserted. The slots include physical connectors and input/output interfaces to establish reception and transmission of signals among all devices coupled to the motherboard. It is the architecture of the interconnection structure that establishes the interface architectures required for the peripheral boards so that communication can occur between all peripherals and the central processing unit in an organized manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The interconnection structure is a printed circuit board or card used to enable the exchange of data (in the form of electrical signals) among other boards or cards connected to it. The structure is typically identified as a backplane having the interconnection slots on one side thereof. The backplane establishes the physical signal exchange interconnection among connected cards. The interconnections are ordinarily established by way of metal wires known as traces. The traces are the physical connections over which electrical signals pass among the various cards associated with the data transmission system. The particular signaling technology running through the traces influences the rate of signal exchange and the number of traces interconnecting individual cards influences signal exchange bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Simply stated, the circuit boards or cards that are connected to the interconnection structure either transmit signals or receive signals. A card that is in a transmitting mode is described as a source card while one that is in receiving mode is described as a sink card or destination card. Apart from that most common set of attributes of a card that performs functions involving interaction with other cards, including a central processing unit, there are cards that operate solely to enable signal exchange. They are referred to as intermediate or switch cards in that they only relay signals between source and sink or destination cards. On the other hand, a function card is designed to carry out specified applications. Finally, a line card is a function card that provides for signal exchange with the external world. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As might be expected, the backplanes of interconnection structures take on various forms to provide the particular functionality required. For example, an active backplane includes one or more active elements that provide some logic functionality. That is, they provide some filtering and routing of signals. A passive backplane, on the other hand, provides no such functionality but instead simply provides a physical medium through which signals are routed to and from all connected cards. While it provides no such filtering or routing capability, a passive backplane is important for system reliability in that all signals are permitted to pass through to each connected card, absent some sort of physical problem with a trace or traces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As is well known in the art, a channel is a physical or optical pathway between the transmitters/receivers of individual cards and/or the central processor, memory, etc., of a data transmission system as well as external interfaces. Each channel is independent and can therefore transfer signals concurrently with other channels. In the field of signal exchange among multiple cards, there are key terms related to the data exchange channels. First, a multi-channel structure is one that includes multiple independent channels providing access from one or more cards to one or more cards. A multi-point channel is a single channel shared by a plurality of transmitting cards. A multi-drop channel, on the other hand, is one that is coupled to a single transmitting or source card but multiple receiving or sink or destination cards. A point-to-point channel is one that has two and only two card connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The importance of the backplane architecture established by the channel arrangement to the field of signal exchange is evident. In particular, it is noteworthy that different systems have different signal exchange requirements, and those requirements are dependent upon backplane channel layout. For example, in an equal access system, each card must transmit and receive a similar amount of information. Such systems include, but are not limited to, Local Area Network (LAN) switches, Wide Area Network (WAN) switches, and Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). In a centralized access system, a single master card dominates access to the backplane and controls exchanges on the backplane. Such systems include, but are not limited to, personal computers. In a multiple access system, a plurality of cards require varying degrees of access to the backplane for transmission and reception as a function of time or particular application running. Such systems include, but are not limited to servers such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In any of the systems described above, it is an important goal to provide a signal exchange system that enables signal exchange with little or no disruption. Increasingly, an important feature of the backplane is to provide for the transfer of greater quantities of signals (bandwidth) at faster propagation rates (high speed). Unfortunately, physical layout limitations and impedance concerns associated with the physical interconnections and signal drivers of many cards restricts high bandwidth, high speed signal transfer. Multi-channel, point-to-point or signal switch fabric interface (SSFI) backplane architecture has been recognized as a reasonable means to maximize signal bandwidth and propagation rates with high reliability. It is suitable for use in centralized and equal access environments. The SSFI backplane involves point-to-point connections enabling an increase in the number of cards connected to the backplane and greater channel access with a minimum number of backplane connections. However, the focus of high-speed signal change has been on internal switching, including through the use of midplane structures rather than backplane structures. There remains a need to increase the speed of data transmission in communications among external systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Therefore, what is needed is an interconnection structure that provides for high bandwidth, high-speed data transfer with little to no impact on signal integrity. Further, what is needed is such an interconnection structure that can be implemented using interface components substantially compatible with new and legacy circuit board interfaces. Yet further, what is needed is a high bandwidth, high speed interconnection structure suitable for deployment in the type of physical space generally available for computing systems. What is also needed is such an interconnection structure that makes efficient use of physical connectors or traces to reduce the impedances associated therewith. An additional need is to increase transmission rates for external signal exchange. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the physical layout of the communication interface architecture for an interconnect system. More particularly, the present invention relates to establishment of the connections among individual circuit boards or cards of a system. The cards may be used for internal signal exchange among boards of the system or for external signal exchange between other systems or system boards such as would be used in a computer or data transmission system, though this invention applies to the actual interconnect within the system. The present invention provides for improved signal exchange at high speed through unique card-interconnect architecture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises an interconnection structure that provides for high bandwidth, high speed data transfer while minimizing impact on signal integrity. In one embodiment, the present invention can provide an interconnection structure that can be implemented using interface components substantially compatible with new and legacy circuit board interfaces. In this or another embodiment, the invention provides an interconnection structure that does not utilize a printed circuit board, such as a backplane or midplane, to connect the various cards. The invention also provides a high bandwidth, high-speed interconnection structure suitable for deployment in the type of physical space generally available for computing and data transmission systems. Furthermore, the invention provides an interconnection structure that makes efficient use of physical connectors and traces to reduce the impedances associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention comprises a mid-connect structure rather than a backplane or midplane structure. More specifically, the invention comprises a mid-connect structure having on one side thereof a first set of function cards in parallel with one another and having a plurality of mid-connect elements applied thereto, and having on the other side thereof a second set of function cards in parallel with one another and having a plurality of mid-connect elements applied thereto. The first set of function cards are electrically coupled to the second set of function cards by connecting the mid-connect elements of the first set to corresponding mid-connect elements of the second set. The first set of function cards are oriented at an angle other than parallel relative to the second set of function cards. This allows one or more of the function cards on one side to attach to one or more of the function cards on the other side. Typically, this would be a perpendicular arrangement of the first set relative to the second set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the first set of function cards can include a first switch card and the second set of function cards can include a second switch card. The switch cards can establish all of the electrical interconnections in this embodiment. The first set of function cards can be electrically interconnected to one another through the second switch card, the second set of function cards can be electrically interconnected to one another through the first switch card, and the first set of function cards can be electrically interconnected to the second set of function cards through a combination of both the first and second switch cards. The switch cards can then provide a point-to-point switch fabric such that each connected function card has an interface to all other function cards through the switch cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To enable the high bandwidth, high-speed signal exchange indicated using the mid-connect configuration described, it is preferable to provide as part of the invention suitable signal transfer circuitry. The signal transfer circuitry should provide signal propagation substantially independent of particular signal exchange protocols. Accordingly, in an embodiment, each switch card includes, and each line or function card preferably includes, transceiver drivers suitable for high frequency propagation. These drivers include, for example, Gunning Transceiver Logic Plus (GTLP), Low Voltage Differential Signal (LVDS), and Positive Emitter Coupled Logic (PECL) drivers. The switch drivers enable signal propagation among cards and to upstream interfaces, such as internal circuitry of a data transmission system including the mid-connect or for interfacing to external devices. For the purpose of this disclosure, line and function cards will be referred to as function cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The design of the switch cards is important in the scheme of the invention. The switch cards should be configured with the processing logic necessary to ensure proper transfer of signals among the various cards connected in the slots of the mid-connect. In one embodiment, the processing logic is configured to recognize all signal transmission protocols so that cards with differing protocols may interface with one another. Therefore, the mid-connect of the invention can be independent of signal protocols and can be suitable as an exchange for legacy and future card protocols. The switch cards of the invention therefore employ, in an embodiment, SerDes and crosspoint switching configurations of the type well known in the art. Moreover, data packeting and arbitration logic are relatively simple to maximize reliable throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages of the invention will become apparent upon review of the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the invention. This embodiment includes a plurality of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a plurality of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> interconnected each directly to the other through a connector arrangement. Mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is configured such that switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are perpendicularly oriented relative to function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In such an orientation, each switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is in electrical contact with every function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and therefore the switching circuitry of each switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be directly connected to all of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. This arrangement effects a direct connection of each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to all other function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can include switch card side interfaces <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Likewise, function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can include function card side interfaces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Interfaces <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can comprise switch devices or drivers/receiver pairs to complete signal propagation among function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, in an embodiment, mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of through connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to establish the interconnection of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Connector pairs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> between switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provide for fast signal transmission with minimal reflections and without the need for a backplane or a midplane structure. Interface devices, such as drivers, receivers, or full duplex driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, can be employed on each of cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to establish a suitable electrical signal exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Generally, each switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably has a discrete driver/receiver pair <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for each connector, while each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a similar discrete driver/receiver pair <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, driver/receiver pairs may be employed solely on switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or solely on function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are located proximate to connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, thereby minimizing stub length between connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. This enables a high-speed data transfer between driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Further, each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can also include an on-card driver/receiver pair <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, generally embedded in an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or Application-Specific Standard Product IC (ASSP) chip. In embodiments where cost is more important than the rate of data transfer, the invention can eliminate the use of driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and rely instead on the ASIC or ASSP driver/receiver pair <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary arrangement having twenty-one switch cards and twenty-one function cards, a 21&times;21 array of through connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is required. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, to provide substantially maximum frequency performance, it is possible in an embodiment of this invention to place drivers/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> directly at card edges <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to minimize stub length on both sides of connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Drivers/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are preferably coupled to each of connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for optimum frequency transmission. It should be noted that driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can take the form of a full duplex transceiver as well. Since there is generally only one connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and no traces between driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, there is a minimal distance for the signal to traverse, thus reducing impedance and variances in impedance in the distance that the signal must travel, and thereby maximizing the frequency performance of the signal. To further enhance the high performance capability on the card, it is possible to either multiplex the signal at driver/receiver pair <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, or demultiplex the signal at driver/receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to produce a maximum frequency signal on the card since this is a point-to-point connection in a well controlled impedance environment of a printed circuit board with no connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> between driver/receiver pair <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on the card causing unwanted changes in impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, in one embodiment connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be established as a set of pairs or sets of pairs of through connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> formed of a female connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a male connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Female connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes a socket into which male connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>fits. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that such connectors can be deployed in the cards. Further, those skilled in the art will recognize that alternative means can be employed to establish short-length connections between switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the invention can be arranged so that female connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are established on switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and male connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are established on function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, in an alternative embodiment, connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be established as an optical connection between switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As in other embodiments, driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be located proximate to each connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for optimum frequency transmission. When an optical connection is used, a backplane is not required. For multi-point, duplex mode connections, connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will comprise two pairs of optical connectors. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, an optical transmitter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and an optical receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be employed at switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, while a corresponding optical transmitter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and optical receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>can be employed at function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as well. Driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, as well as additional driver/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, can be located proximate to each connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for optimum frequency transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of sets of pairs of through connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is determined by a user as a function of throughput required, transceiver technology employed, and layout space available. In embodiments of the invention, card cages can be used to hold switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> stable, and a support structure can also be deployed between cards. In the arrangement of mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the communication established is multi-channel, point-to-point with full duplex connections. However, in alternative embodiments, any sort of communication form may be employed with system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the invention including, but not limited to, unidirectional and bi-directional communications. Of course, two trace sets of through connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are generally required for bi-directional communication. Full duplex communication enables sourcing and sinking from or to each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and it doubles the performance parameters compared to unidirectional transmission. Alternatively, unidirectional operation halves the number of required trace sets as that of the bi-directional embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, each switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can include a switch device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can include a switch device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> demultiplexer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can be employed on one or more of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to reduce the number of direct connections associated with switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Each of the respective switch devices <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be selected by the user, but switch devices that are particularly well suited for use in the invention include, for example, the LVDS family of switches offered by Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation of South Portland, Me. Alternatively, a Positive Emitter Coupled Logic (PECL) switch may be employed, particularly to maximize throughput. In the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has the full bandwidth of X Gbps by Y switch connections available. In other embodiments, resources can be located on switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, if desired. Moreover, effective redundancy can be accomplished by deselecting a switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> upon the failure of that single switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. For the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has the full bandwidth of X Gbps by Y switch connections available, while the demultiplexer allows for a lesser number of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be connected, thus improving scaling performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the invention comprises a printed circuit board such as a midplane structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> that functions as a card cage to support and align switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on a first mid-connect side <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, and to support and align function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on a second mid-connect side <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, in a connection manner well known to those skilled in the art. Connectors <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, with accurate alignment provided by midplane structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as they are attached to switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, may each be unitary and pass completely through the body of the structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, or they may be discrete elements on each of sides <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> but electrically coupled together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, midplane structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is configured with a plurality of slots on each of sides <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> for receiving therein a selectable, number of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a selectable number of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, respectively. The slots of structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> are arranged so that switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are perpendicularly oriented relative to function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As explained above, in such an orientation, the switching circuitry of respective switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be directly connected to all of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to effect a direct connection of each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to all other function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can include switch devices <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can include switch devices <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to complete signal propagation interfaces among function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can include drivers/receiver pairs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) for signal propagation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, it may be desirable to provide direct connections between two function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or sets of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, rather than providing point-to-point connections through switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the invention that comprises a multi-plane switching, mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, which includes switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in both a first plane <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and a second plane <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of the invention. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there are two switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in each plane <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. The remaining cards are function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the number of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not restricted to any particular number, and each plane can have anywhere from 0% to 100% of its slots filled with switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The remaining slots are accordingly filled with function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, two switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are provided in each plane <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> for purposes of redundancy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Having function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in both planes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> allows all of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in plane <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to be directly coupled to all of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in plane <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The direct connections can be through switches or multiplexer/demultiplexer pairs located on function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> themselves, or through direct point-to-point connections to and from a function or resource block on two or more cards. The connections can also be between multiple functions on a single card or multiple channels to an individual function. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there can be an electrical connection between function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at every intersection of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, or there can be connections only between select function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, dependent upon where connections between function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, system sections can be partially isolated from one another within a card cage. This can be beneficial in optimizing performance of the system when there are multiple, independent functional blocks in the system. One example of such a system with multiple functional blocks is a single overall system providing all of the functionality required for an Infiniband Subnet, or an Internet or Application Service Provider physical site comprised of routers, switches, storage, and servers. All of these functions can fit well into mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> using the direct connections between function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Isolation of functional blocks within a system can also prove useful for security purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As with previous embodiments, interfaces <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> can be provided on function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to complete signal propagation among function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Interfaces <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> can comprise switch devices or drivers/receiver pairs, and can directly couple function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in plane <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in plane <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C are top-views of different embodiments of mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Each line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C represents a function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of mid-connect system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, herein labeled <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>A, with primary storage and processing function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> using only direct, card-to-card connections, and no switch cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in a first plane <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> comprise input/output cards <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and memory cards <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. Memory cards <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> generally contain memory commonly found in computer systems, including but not limited to DRAM memory. In a second plane <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> of system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>A, function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprise two sets of cards <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> that can perform different tasks. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>A comprises a 16&times;16 array of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, although in alternate embodiments any number of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can make up the array. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the label &ldquo;I&rdquo; on the connections between input/output cards <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and cards <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> indicates a connection where input/output data is passed. And the label &ldquo;M&rdquo; between memory cards <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and cards <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> indicates a connection where memory data is passed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, herein labeled <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>B, with primary storage and processing function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with independent support cards (input/output and memory) for each. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, first plane <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> comprises input/output cards <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and memory cards <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. Second plane <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> comprises a set of storage cards <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and a set of processor cards <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. Half of input/output cards <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> are used by storage cards <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, and half are used by processor cards <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. Likewise, half of memory cards <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are used by storage cards <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, and half are used by processor cards <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>B includes two pairs of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, one pair disposed in plane <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, and the second pair disposed in plane <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. As before, the label &ldquo;I&rdquo; indicates a connection where input/output data is passed, and the label &ldquo;M&rdquo; indicates a connection where memory data is passed. In addition to there, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> the label &ldquo;W&rdquo; indicates a switch connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, an embodiment of system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, labeled system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>C, is shown containing function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprising primary processing cards with common support cards and storage cards. Function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of plane <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> include input/output cards <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, memory cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a pair of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and storage cards <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Memory cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> generally contain volatile memory, such as DRAM, while storage cards <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> generally contain non-volatile memory, such as a hard disk drive. Function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of plane <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> include two sets of processor cards <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, plane <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> can include wild cards <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> that can be used for any desired functionality. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, in addition to the previously mentioned labels, the label &ldquo;S&rdquo; indicates a connection over which storage data is passed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C are merely three examples of the limitless number of embodiments possible for mid-connect interconnection system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. All types of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that are available can be used in this invention, and in any number. Likewise, more or less than two switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be used in any embodiment as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, another embodiment of the invention is shown that comprises a System Area Network in a box (SANB) <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. In SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, it is possible to put all of the components from a System Area Network into a single structure while allowing for modular scalability of any component as required by the system expansion needs. In one embodiment of SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, the preferred method can be to use switch connections only, though direct connections can be used for higher performance on specific connections between specific function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As many connections are possible at the intersection of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> from the two planes of SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> as can be fit into the spacing between these function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At the intersection of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the invention can provide many connections to adequately address the bandwidth needs caused by many function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> attempting to access through switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in both planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> All of the conventional components of a System Area Network, such as routers, switches, servers, storage, RAIDs, I/O, and memory, can be placed into the architecture of SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> as card components. If SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is a switch-connect system only, then any of the card components can be placed at any card location except slots that are dedicated to switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, since the switch component connector configuration is different. If all intersections between function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> have connectors, then any function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be placed in any slot of SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> comprises two planes <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. In plane <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> consisting of at least one router card <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, memory cards <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, storage cards <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, and input/output cards <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. There are also two switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in plane <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. In plane <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> include director cards <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>, and server cards <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. Plane <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> also includes a pair of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and at least one router card <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The mid-connect interconnection system of the present invention allows for easy upgrading to the next level of performance, since there is no fixed backplane or midplane between function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In the case of multi-plane switching, all that is required is that switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> be changed with backward compatible upgraded switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Then all other cards, namely function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, can be upgraded as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> This ability to upgrade the card interconnections is due to the fact that there is no printed circuit card to limit the connections. Every connector and card is an isolated, replaceable piece of the system. When configured correctly, the ability to add connections, provide higher speed connections, or change transmission media (i.e. electrical to optical) is possible. It is preferred to leave the original connector as part of the new connection scheme to allow for backward compatibility to the original components of the system. It is also preferred to leave expansion room available between connectors to be able to widen the connector with more connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The distribution of power within mid-connect interconnection systems <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, or within SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, presents a unique challenge to the virtual backplane architecture of the invention. In the absence of an actual printed circuit board for card interconnect, a new way to distribute power between cards is required. In the case of a multi-plane switching system, with dedicated switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in each plane of the system, the task can be relatively straightforward. In one embodiment, power distribution can reside on switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with power connections provided for each of function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the opposing plane. Since switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are generally present in a switch based system, power would always be present. In the embodiment used for redundancy, which requires at least two switch cards in each plane, power redundancy would also be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Another approach if switch card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> cannot be used to supply power, or in the instance of a non-switch card based system, would be to dedicate slots to the power distribution task. Again, two power distribution slots or cards in each plane with connections from each power card to each function card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the opposing plane would allow for redundancy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Mid-connect systems <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, as well as SANB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, of the present invention establish a signal switching fabric interface that enables high bandwidth, high-speed throughput. Use of the present invention eliminates the need for a backplane or midplane card, thereby allowing any failures to be single point failures, and providing for limitless upgradeability. The invention creates a very dense system structure, approaches subnet level complexity, maximizes link speeds, and provides for simple optical connections, The invention also provides multi-stage connects, including direct card-to-card interconnects, multiplexed connects, single-stage switching, and multi-stage switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The invention has a wide array of applications including, but not limited to, multi-processor servers, LAN and WAN routers and switches, and RAIDs. Further, the switch cards can be configured to manage any sort of signal propagation protocol including, but not limited to, Ethernet, Fibrechannel, Infiniband, and RapidIO, for example, each having its particular switch architecture. The point-to-point arrangement described permits the simplest form of data transmission to fit into the space available, especially if high-speed transceivers are employed such as is available through GTLP, LVDS, and PECL. This enables a system providing minimum distance between connections for a virtually unlimited number of switch cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and function cards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, with a virtually unlimited number of channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the present invention provides a convenient layout capable of handling channel speeds of the type associated with Ethernet, Infiniband, and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET/SDH), for example, and with substantially more cards than has heretofore been possible. In particular, 2.5 Gigabits per second (Gbps) transmission may be generated using the transceiver drivers identified. In the exemplar mid-connect arrangement shown in a full duplex mode, with 21 switch cards and 21 line cards, it is possible to provide a bandwidth on the order of 21&times;21&times;2&times;2.5 Gbps&equals;2.205 Terabits per second. That sort of bandwidth is enabled in the invention using an efficient connection layout in a board space of the type currently available and with transceiver drivers currently available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Similar performance can be shown for a computer system, rather than a data transmission system, without the need for the switches on the function cards. In this case, to provide scalable performance, a variable number of input deserializers would be required on the function cards. In this way, the number of switches could be adjusted to the scaled performance requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to particular example embodiments, it is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
