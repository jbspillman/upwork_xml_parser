<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a watch display holder, and more particularly to a free size automatic watch display holder which can selectively adjust its size to hold various sizes and different types of watchband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Arts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The market for watches is highly competitive and saturated. For the well-known brand name watch, the name sells the watch. However, for inexpensive watches, the marketing, the advertising, and the display are sometimes more integral to the sale of watch than the actual watch itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Watches come in all sizes and varieties, such as men&apos;s watches, lady&apos;s watches, and child&apos;s watches. Moreover, watchbands may be thin or thick, wide or narrow. The length of the watchbands varies with the size of the wrist of the wearer to be surrounded. The watchband may be chain-type and made of metal, or belt-type and made of leather, simulated leather or other cloth type material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Presently, since watches come in various sizes and shapes, watch holder must be shaped and sized to fittedly support the watch. In order to display the watches or keep them properly, the watches are often fitted in a clasped state around a watchband-supporting frame. Generally speaking, the watchband-supporting frame has a &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo; shape such that the watch is arranged to clasp around the watchband-supporting frame to keep the watch in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These simple &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo; shaped watchband-supporting frames come in different sizes to fit the variety of watches available in the marketplace. Practically, a man&apos;s watch has a bigger watchband than a woman&apos;s watch or a child&apos;s watch. Therefore, the watchband-supporting frame for man&apos;s watch or a child&apos;s watch. Therefore, the watchband-supporting frame for man&apos;s watch must be shaped and sized accordingly so that the man&apos;s watch can fit snugly around the watchband-supporting frame. Similarly, the watchband-supporting frame for the child&apos;s watch has a smaller size to accommodate the smaller watchband thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, great cost must be involved in the purchase of various kinds of watch holders having different sizes because the watch manufacturer cannot find a standardized watch holder or watchband-supporting frame to fit the great variety of watches. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> of the drawings, a free size automatic watch display holder according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated, wherein the free size automatic watch display holder is adapted for holding watches of various sizes and different types of watchband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the free size automatic watch display holder comprises an upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> providing an arc shaped upper supporting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> providing an arc shaped lower supporting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and an extendable supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supported between the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The extendable supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises an upper support member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> transversely extended from an inner surface of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a lower support member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> transversely extended from an inner surface of the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a movable operating frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprising a base <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>, having a slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>, upwardly extended from the lower support member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> which is downwardly extended from the upper support member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and arranged to slidably insert into the slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> such that by frictionally sliding the slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> along the slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> so as to selectively adjust a distance between the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The upper supporting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided at an outer side thereof and the lower supporting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the lower upper holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided at an outer side thereof. The upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are adapted to move towards each other in a closed position and to move away from each other in an opened position. In other words, the watch display holder is designed to hold the watch in circular position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are made of semi-rigid material wherein each of said upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is capable of selectively adjusting a width between two ends of each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In other words, a curvature of each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to fittedly bias against an inner side of the watch when the watch is mounted around the watch display holder of the present invention. Moreover, each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should be formed a flat upper and lower supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively so as to enhance the surfaces of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in contact with the inner side of the watch. Preferably, a soft fabric is provided on each of the upper and lower supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the watch display holder and well protect the watch held thereon so as to prevent an unwanted scratch by the watch display holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a predetermined width that must be at least as wide as a width of the watchband of the watch in order to allow adequate support for the watchband when the watch is mounted around the watch display holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rigidly supported between the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> wherein the supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is adapted to vertically extend in a slidably movable manner, so as to adjustably increase the distance between the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is made of durable material such as plastic which is in low cost and easy to manufacture in order to support the watch display holder rigidly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment, the base <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of the movable operating frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is upwardly and perpendicularly extended from the lower supporting member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> has a pair of parallel slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> vertically and downwardly extended from a top of the base <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, there are two slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> downwardly extended from the upper supporting member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> wherein the two slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> are fittedly received in the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> respectively in a slidably movable manner such that the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> are adapted to frictionally slide along the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> respectively. A top end of each slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is perpendicularly affixed to the upper supporting member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such that when the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is pulled upwardly, the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> are arranged to slide upwardly along the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>, so as to adjust the distance between the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Each of the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> has a predetermined length adapted to slide along the respective slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> between the opened position and the closed position, wherein in the opened position, the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved to space apart from the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and in the closed position, the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved towards to the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form a loop structure while two ends of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are biased against two ends of the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each of the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, having a rectangular cross section, is fittedly slid along the respective slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> having the corresponding shaped. Since there are two slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> slidably inserted into the two slider slots <highlight><bold>3211</bold></highlight> respectively, the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime; are adapted to maintain the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in position, so as to prevent any twisting movement of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with respect to the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is obvious that only one slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is extended from the upper supporting frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to slidably insert into the slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. However, the slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> must be constructed to have a non-circular cross sectional structure to slidably insert into the slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> having the corresponding size and shape, so as to prevent the twisting movement of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with respect to the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Due to a mutual frictional force exerted on contact surfaces between the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and inner surfaces of the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>, the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is frictionally held in position. So, the user is able to simply adjust a height of the watch display holder, which is the distance between the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in order to fit the various sizes of the watch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In order to maintain the arc shape of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the watch display holder further comprises an upper holding frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> affixed to the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a lower holding frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> affixed to the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the upper holding frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is affixed to the inner surface of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at two end portions thereof to retain the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an arc shaped structure and the lower holding frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is affixed to the inner surface of the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at two end portions thereof to retain the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in an arc shaped structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the upper holding frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has two ends integrally extended from two end portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> respectively and the lower holding frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has two ends integrally extended from two end portions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the lower holding frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> respectively such that the upper holding frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the lower holding frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are capable of keeping the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the arc shape manner respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The upper and lower holding frames <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are made of semi-rigid material that adapted to be bent in a curved shape. It is worth mentioning that when the curvature of each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adjusted to fittedly support the watch, each of the upper and lower holding frames <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is capable of bending to adjust the width between the two ends thereof so as to retain the shape of each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the upper support member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is mounted to the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a position above the upper holding frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the lower support member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is mounted to the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a position below the lower holding frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that the operation of the movable operating frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will not be interrupted the width adjustment of each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Practically, all sizes of watch can be fittedly mounted around the watch display holder of the present invention in the circular manner for displaying and storing purpose. For a smaller size of watch, such as woman&apos;s size or child&apos;s size, the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> are slidably moved towards bottom ends of the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> respectively so as to reduce the distance between the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> since the circumference of the watch is relatively small. For a larger size of watch, such as a man&apos;s size which has a larger circumference, the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> are adapted to slidably move away from the bottom ends of the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> respectively so as to increase the distance between the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In order to use the watch display holder, the user simply minimizes the height of the watch display holder by pulling the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> towards the lower upper <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and places the watch display holder to the inner circumference of the watch. Then, the user may pull the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> away from the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to lengthen the height of the watch display holder such that the watch will be fittedly mounted around the watch display holder in the circular manner. It is worth mentioning that by adjusting the width of the two ends of each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the upper supporting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower supporting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are fittedly in contact with the inner circumference of the watch, so as to substantially support the watch, especially for displaying the watch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user is able to take out the watch display holder from the watch by simply pulling the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> towards the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to reduce the height of the watch display holder until the inner circumference of the watch is departed from the upper and lower supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> second embodiment of the watch display holder illustrates an alternative mode of the first preferred embodiment, wherein the watch display holder has the same structural design of the first embodiment, except the extendable supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; further provide a resilient ability to retain the distance of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment, the movable operating frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; further comprises two resilient elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; disposed in the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>&prime; respectively for applying an urging pressure against the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime; so as to normally retain the watch display holder at the opened position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Each of the resilient element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;, according to the preferable embodiment of the present invention, is a compression spring which is disposed in the respective slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>&prime; and is provided between the bottom end of the slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>&prime; and a bottom end of the slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime;. Each of the resilient element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; has two ends biasing against the bottom end of the respective slider slot <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>&prime; and the bottom end of the respective slider arm <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime; in such a manner that the resilient elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; will normally urge and retain the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; in an upper position that the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime; are slid upwardly from the slider slots <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>&prime; respectively so as to retain the distance between the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Since the resilient elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; retain the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; in the upper position, the user is able to push the upper holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; towards the lower holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; to compress the resilient elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; by the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime; respectively, so as to reduce the distance between the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;. Then, after placing the watch display holder within the inner circumference of the watch, the user is able to release the compression force applied on the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; such that the compressed resilient elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; will rebound to their original forms so as to push the slider arms <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>&prime; back to their original positions. Therefore, the upper and lower supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are biased against the inner circumference of the watch by means of the resilient arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by adjusting the width each of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; the upper and lower supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; of the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are fittedly support the inner circumference of the watch while the upper and lower holders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are rigidly supported by the upper and lower holding frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is worth mentioning that all kinds of watch including the belt-type and the metal link-type watches can be mounted around the watch display holder in the circular manner. Moreover, the present invention allows a watch manufacturer to use a standardized and universal watch display holder for any size of watch so as to highly reduce the manufacturing cost of the watch holder and increase the convenience and utility of the watch display holder. </paragraph>
