<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a method and system for providing wireless electronic content to members of the public. More particularly, the invention relates to providing a wireless electronic content delivery system based on mobile vehicles, as of the Postal Service. Alternatively a stationary network to deliver electronic content is established in Postal Service facilities. A device, such as a Family Message Board, receives delivery of the wireless electronic content, whether from a mobile vehicle or fixed postal station. The wireless electronic content may be processed for a variety of uses including email, internet access, graphic messages, and postal secure notifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Current technology for electronic content delivery includes such methods as telephone line delivery, cable line delivery, satellite delivery, and cell phone delivery. Each of these methods are useful, but they all have weaknesses. Telephone and cable connections for electronic content delivery require a wire line or physical connection between the source of the content and the content viewing mechanism. Satellite and cell sources of electronic content delivery do not allow for universal access and have security weaknesses. Current technology for electronic content viewing devices or receivers include such things as computers, telephones, televisions, cell phones and PDAs. However, there is not a customer-friendly device that does not need to be plugged in or hard wired into a wall outlet, and that has the same functionality as the currently existing devices. One problem in particular is that many people cannot use the receivers or devices as a group, the way a family may use a message board on a refrigerator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are currently many limitations to wireless technology. In terms of providing universal access, the most critical problem is an inconsistent ability to access a wireless network. Transmission stations which are used to access the network cannot either be placed everywhere because of physical and monetary restrictions. Uncontrollable factors such as weather, geography and population density also affect the ability to create a true universal network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a method and system that provides a source of wireless electronic content through mobile delivery and a versatile means of receiving the wireless electronic content. A Family Message Board device (or similar device) meets the need for a household source or message board, which serves as a content delivery device. The existing art does not meet this need for a variety of reasons. A computer can be used by several members of the household but is not always accessible; it may not be in a central location, it can be quite large, and it may need access to many types of electrical plugs or can tie up phone lines. With a computer, there is no easy way to leave notes that can be electronically accessed from other locations, other than as voice mail messages. Current technology can also have problems with interruption to the transmission of information or a lack of seamless switching between a variety of transmission means. The Family Message Board device solves these problems by being small with a simple wireless connection to the U.S. Postal Service network. By mounting to a refrigerator in a kitchen (for example), the device can be placed in a central often-used place. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for sharing information over a wireless network. The solution to these problems involves two things. First, there is provided a mobile backbone for an electronic content delivery system, such as via the U.S. Postal Service vehicles. Second, there is a device, such as a Family Message Board, that receives the electronic content delivery either from a mobile vehicle or fixed postal station, and processes it for a variety of uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An electronic content delivery system via the U.S. Postal Service would solve the problem of lack of universal access. First, a communication system is located within each postal vehicle. As a postal vehicle goes on a delivery route, it would transmit and receive electronic content from households along the route. The postal routes could be set routes allowing for targeted delivery to certain homes. Beyond this mobile fleet, there are post office stations with stationary communications systems that would be able to transmit electronic content to the surrounding neighborhood. The communications system would be able to switch between digital wireless communication and low band radio frequencies to transmit electronic content. With this electronic content delivery system, information may be sent in secure packets via wireless or radio frequency from postal delivery trucks or facilities to customers. The transmission of content itself and the content are protected from tampering under Federal Law, as the content is uploaded and/or downloaded into the mobile transmission station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claim. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. Thus, the present invention comprises a combination of features, steps, and advantages which enable it to overcome various deficiencies of the prior art. The various characteristics described above, as well as other features, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, and by referring to the accompanying drawings. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a simplistic view of the content delivery system. It shows the U.S. Postal Service transmitting wireless content to the U.S. Postal Service customer and vice versa. The content for delivery may be generated by the U.S. Postal Service or it may be downloaded into the U.S. Postal Service system from the internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows more detail in an overall view of an electronic content delivery system. It shows U.S. Postal Service facilities, such as post offices and mail processing facilities, transmitting and receiving information from U.S. Postal Service vehicles, such as mail trucks and rural delivery vehicles. Both of these, U.S. Postal Service facilities and U.S. Postal Service vehicles, upload, download, and transmit electronic content to U.S. Postal Service customers and vice versa. Included in the upload to the vehicle may be a request to the system for access to a particular internet location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, there is a wireless network of U.S. Postal Service facilities and vehicles which create a secure wireless network with the customer. The facilities will transmit (i.e., upload and download) content to the vehicles that are specific to the customers on vehicles or carrier&apos;s route, and then those vehicles in turn transmit information to the specific customers as they drive along their route. Thus, there is both a hard copy delivery network and a wireless delivery network. For example, it is envisioned that the U.S. Postal Service facilities in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, will be able to accept electronic content from business customers, such as large mail houses, advertising agencies, print shops, etc. The U.S. Postal Service would then be able to take the content and transmit it wirelessly to the subscribed customers, either from the U.S. Postal Services facilities and/or from U.S. Postal Services vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> shows the different providers and facilities, and different varieties of vehicles that transmit and receive information as part of an electronic content delivery system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> shows several but not all of the types of U.S. Postal Service facilities <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, from a mail-processing center <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to a bulk mail center <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to a regular post office <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> also shows several but not all of the types of U.S. Postal Service vehicles <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, from a standard postal delivery van <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a rural carrier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and a rural carrier contract vehicle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In rural areas, the postal service contracts to rural carriers who use their own private cars under private contract to the U.S. Postal Service. The figure also shows U.S. Postal Service customers <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. There are a variety of postal service customers who receive mail delivery in a variety of ways, from the standard house mailbox to the apartment building cluster boxes. The U.S. Postal Service has a variety of customers and any customer would be able to be part of this system as the system provides for universal access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a house, which is labeled U.S. Postal Service Customer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and a truck. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows one approach of delivery of electronic content to a U.S. Postal Service customer from Postal Service vehicles and/or facilities. The truck symbolizes a U.S. Postal Service delivery vehicle. This can be either a postal service owned truck or a contracted vehicle. The truck has a wireless antenna <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and a computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, produces electronic content that is transmitted through the antenna to the U.S. Postal Service customer. In household <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, there is a Family Message Board unit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also shows a lightning bolt from the truck to the household depicting that as the truck moves through the neighborhood, it may transmit electronic content to the devices within the households and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one can replace the truck with a postal service facility and it can have the same interaction with the U.S. Postal Service customer. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the content delivered is not being sent through a third party means, but rather only through U.S. Postal Service vehicles or facilities, and thus is secure. The secure relaying of electronic content from the U.S. Postal Service to the customer can interface with the Family Message Board device or with other commercially developed products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the computer that was either in the postal service facility and/or the postal service vehicle. Computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes a variety of elements. There is a computer processor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a wireless input-output transmitting device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> with a connection for a wireless antenna <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and a memory that will hold information content and customer requests. Computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may also include other components such as memory <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, that may include information content <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and customer requests <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the wireless input-output portion of the computer which was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Element <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is comprised of components combined in a unique way. The wireless capabilities include digital wireless or low band radio frequency, or both. Thus, the device can transmit electronic content wirelessly, using either digital wireless, and/or low band radio frequency. With the ability to transmit in two different ways, if one of those ways, such as digital wireless does not work or there is interference, the alternate system is used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a simplified representation of the Family Message Board. The Family Message Board was originally depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows some of the basic elements of the Family Message Board. Element <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is a computer which is housed within device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Element <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is a standard touch screen, which displays information and is the interface for the user. Optionally, the unit could have a screen saver or a screen cover to protect the screen. If the unit is on all the time, a screen saver could be used. Element <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is a wireless antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> depicts one mode of operation, using elements <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, as previously explained. For input into the device, there are many alternatives. For example, a keyboard could be used instead of the touch screen. For data transmission, there are also many alternatives. Instead of a wireless antenna, device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> could use wire line or other data transmission means. In addition, there are a variety of computers that could be used within device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> represents one of many possible modes of operation. </paragraph>

Beyond the elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, there are optional enhancements, as shown by elements <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. Element <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, is a stylus, such as a stylus pen, with a holder. This pen can be used to write a message on the Family Message Board or to touch parts of the screen. Element <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is an infra-red detector or IR port, which enables the device to download and/or upload information to or from either a wireless device, such as a cell phone or a PDA, or any other device that transmits information via an infra-red port. Both stylus <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and IR port <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may be used in a variety of applications. Element <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> includes forward and backward buttons, which are used to scroll forward and backwards through either viewing screens or through different software elements within the device. Element <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> is a ball, such as a roll ball, mouse, guide or track ball, which would allow the user to move a cursor around the screen, just as one does now on a standard computer. Element <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is a touch screen, although another option is to have a non touch sensitive screen instead. In one implementation, element <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is a flat screen, however, other types of displays can be used. Element <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is a set of buttons on the side of the device which allows the user to choose different applications in the device and can be linked to different commands within the operating system software on the device. Within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, all the elements can be placed anywhere within or on the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> shows more optional elements of device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, including elements <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>. Element <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is a solar energy panel. Element <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> depicts a solar panel which can power the device using artificial and/or natural light. Solar panels <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be placed anywhere on the device. Element <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> depicts a rechargeable power source which obtains power from solar panel <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> or any other energy source, and element <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> can store energy for later use. Thus, device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be powered by more conventional means, such as through an electrical outlet or batteries. Element <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> includes one or more speakers. Speakers <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> include digital speakers or other types of speakers. Speakers <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> can be placed anywhere on device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Element <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> is a backlighting device which illuminates the screen in the low light and/or dark conditions. This is a standard light source that is found on many devices, such as cell phones and PDAs. Element <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> is a microphone. This microphone enables device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to record verbal and/or sound messages. Element <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is a button that works as both a proximity detector and an on/off switch. It can be implemented as two distinct elements or as one integrated element. For the proximity detection functionality, it would cause device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to turn the screen on when a person comes near the device and to turn off the device when it has not been used for a set time. For the on/off function, pressing the button would turn the device screen on or off. All of these elements can be placed anywhere on the device and do not necessarily have to be where they are depicted in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>. Any or all of the elements that are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</cross-reference> can be incorporated into device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows optional elements that are on the back or bottom of the device, numbered <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight>. Element <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is a magnetic component which enables the device to be mounted on a metal surface, like a refrigerator. Element <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight> is a table stand, so the device can be put upon a table instead of a wall surface. Element <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> depicts a wall mount that enables the device to be mounted on the wall, by a means other than magnetic means. Element <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight> depicts shielding which would prevent the magnetic fields from the magnets interfering with the operation of device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and the internal memory of the machine. The elements <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> can be placed anywhere on the back or bottom of the device and do not need to appear exactly as they appear in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows computer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> in more detail. This is similar to the computer described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Computer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> includes a variety of elements. There is a computer processor, a wireless input-output transmitting device with a wireless antenna, and a memory that will hold information content and customer requests. Computer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> may also include other components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> could be built in any size or shape. The device should be big enough to allow easy viewing and thin enough for easy mounting and placement. One set of dimensions of the device could be 12 inches tall by 12 inches wide by an half inch thick. This would enable the device to be relatively small, enable the device to be mounted easily, and would also enable the device not to be in the way of any other operations within the household. It would also be less obtrusive than many of the consumer products currently in the market place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Methods of Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> provides an overview of the applications of device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the customer unit. These applications include e-mail <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, internet access <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, special messages <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, U.S. Postal Service Secure Notification <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> and other uses <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>. The use of some of the options are common electronic communications, e.g., e-mail and internet access. In order to use some of these options, i.e. special messages or U.S. Postal Service secured notification, the U.S. Postal Service customer would need to opt-in to the option. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> provides more detail on the use of e-mail. The use of e-mail could be, but is not limited to, an e-mail account that is based on the electronic content delivery system <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. The customer unit, or device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, could have a unique e-mail address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Another option is to tie the customer unit to other email accounts <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, including forwarding messages from other accounts. The email software at the customer unit may have specific folders such as an inbox, trash, messages sent, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> provides more detail on internet access. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, internet access flow includes two types of use, periodic download <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and immediate download <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. In periodic download, the user has the ability to download and/or upload content at specific time intervals. A periodic download may be necessary, if there is not a continual available source for internet access. For example, the user could program the device to refresh the memory at a specific time, such as, two o&apos;clock in the morning, or whenever the user has internet access. In immediate download, the user has the ability to download and/or upload content at all times. Immediate download depends on availability, but if digital access or radio frequency access through the U.S. Postal Service is available, the user could connect to the internet at any time using the device. However, constant use may or may not be an option in all areas. Internet access provides for accessing email <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, the world wide web <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, and other uses <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> such as connecting to different types of information content such as, Gopher Systems, and/or other types of information content protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> provides more detail on special messages. Special messages include but are not limited to three types of message relaying systems. One type of message system is a graffiti writing board <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, like those available on handheld PDAs, which enables the user of the device to write a message on the touch screen. Another type of message system is a microphone board <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>. The microphone board is a voice message system, where a user records a message to be accessed later, either by the user or someone else. Another type of message system is pay message content <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>. Pay message content is an option where companies and/or businesses would send advertising mail and/or messages to the consumer in an opt-in mode that would be displayed on the Family Message Board. As an example, instead of receiving pizza coupons via a hard copy mail, a company could provide those same coupons electronically to the consumer. The consumer could also use the feature to securely order items from a business. This would be part of an opt-in program where a customer could choose to receive and send electronic requests through the Family Message Board. By choosing to participate, the consumer could access local businesses like a grocery store. The customer could send an order to the grocery store for groceries and then have them waiting for them at a particular time. In turn the grocery store could inform the customer of sales or promotions. This local opt-in access program would provide a valuable service to the community. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> provides more detail on Secure Notification. Secure Notification uses special protocols that are unique to the U.S. Postal Service and unique to the device, such as an electronic postmark <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Within Secure Notification, the customer could change their address <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, transmit special request to the postal service <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>, (for example, hold mail), and could transmit information on special programs <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> as (for example, eBill Pay). A delivery notification <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> feature could be included. This could help with the current problem that in order for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver a package to a household, a member of the household must be present to accept that package. Depending on security of the neighborhood, the U.S. Postal Service will leave a slip of paper on the customer&apos;s door. The customer then either has to sign the paper and describe where they want their package left or they have to go physically to a post office location, present the slip and then accept the package. Delivery notification from the U.S. Postal Service would electronically link a physical address to an electronic address. It would send to the electronic address notification of a package. The user could send back to the postal service instructions on what to do with the package. Then the package would be delivered per the instructions. Also the delivery notification option would also enable the user to sign for delivery of express mail and/or certified mail using an electronic signature. These are just some of many examples of different options of delivery notification. Electronic receipts <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> for delivery of items is another option. When a user accepts a package, a receipt for the delivery of a parcel or a product could be sent to the sender, with signature confirmation and/or delivery confirmation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> provides more detail on other optional uses of the customer unit. Other options include an electronic calendar <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> or digital calendar, a phone book/address book <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, as well as other options <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight>. These uses may be performed by any software application that the user could use within this device, such as a software program for cooking or an index of recipes. One skilled in the art would be aware of other uses for the apparatus and methods described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of this invention have been shown and described, modifications thereof can be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or teaching of this invention. The embodiments described herein are exemplary only and are not limiting. Many variations and modifications of the system and apparatus are possible and are within the scope of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the process just described may easily have steps added, taken away, or modified without departing from the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited to the embodiments described herein, but is only limited by the claims which follow, the scope of which shall include all equivalents of the subject matter of the claims. </paragraph>
