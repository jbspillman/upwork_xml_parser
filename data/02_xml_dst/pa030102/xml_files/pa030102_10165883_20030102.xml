<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This is a continuation of international application No. PCT/US00/33553, filed Dec. 11, 2000, which is pending at the time of filing hereof, and which international application claims priority based upon United Kingdom patent application serial number 9929350.8, filed Dec. 10, 1999, now abandoned. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a packaging machine which is especially suitable for processing packaging from blank to constructed and filled carton. The machine is readily adjustable to accommodate various carton types and also to allow the articles to pass through the machine without being packaged. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The majority of known packaging machines are dedicated machines that construct one type of carton and apply those cartons to articles of known size and shape. However, when articles are not of fixed dimensions then it becomes difficult to automate the packaging process. One such example is foodstuff, for example poultry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a packaging machine which overcomes the technical disadvantages of known packaging machines and is capable of packaging articles that are not of known fixed dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A further problem associated with the prior art is that adjustment to machines usually requires removal of all the cartons within the packaging machine and possibly mechanical adjustment of components in the machine. During this changeover period a machine cannot be used (known as &ldquo;downtime&rdquo;) which is an expensive delay in the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore it is a further object of the present invention to provide a packaging machine which is capable of switching from one carton type or size to another or selecting articles to be packaged from a conveyor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to overcome, or at least mitigate, the problems of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to overcome these commercial disadvantages by providing one machine which is able to set up and load more than one type of carton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention provides an apparatus to tighten opposed ends of a wraparound carton around an article in a stream of articles of variable size during continuous forward movement. The apparatus comprises one or more panel engaging elements to engage one end panel of the carton, a guide assembly to guide the engaged end panel into overlapping relationship with the opposed end panel held by the apparatus. There further comprises a tightening device for tightening the carton panels around the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the engaging element is mounted to the guide assembly moveable in a transverse direction to the carton feed path to engage the end panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the transverse movement of the engaging element and guide assembly relative to the carton perpendicular to the carton feed direction is determined by cam means. Preferably, the cam means comprises a fixed cam track in which a cam follower attached to the guide assembly slidably fits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to an optional feature of this aspect of the invention, the tightening device causes the engaging element to move from a deployed position to a retracted position when the desired panel tension is reached thereby to release the engaged end panel. Optionally, the tightening device includes a resilient biasing means to cause the engaging element to move between retraced and deployed positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to another optional feature of this aspect of the invention the guide assembly may be mounted on a continuous conveyor in a parallel plane to a carton conveyor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a further optional feature of this aspect of the invention there may further comprise panel securing means to cause the opposing ends of the carton to be placed in face contacting relationship to be secured therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a still further optional feature of this aspect of the invention, the panel securing means is further provided by a face of the guide assembly which face guides the overlapping panels in to abutment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to yet another optional feature of this aspect of the invention a glue gun may be provided to apply a layer of glue to one of the end panels to secure the end panels in overlapping arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the invention provides a packaging machine for continuously setting up and loading sleeve type cartons with one or more articles, for example, poultry comprising opposed side and end walls which machine comprises an article conveyor for conveying the articles through the machine. Carton feed apparatus is provided to sequentially to deliver successive cartons from a supply in flat collapsed condition to a setting up station of the machine and panel folding devices fold the carton into a set up wraparound condition. Support means is adapted to be brought into contact with the carton during movement downstream so that the carton is maintained in a set up condition and an article loading apparatus for loading at least one article into one or both ends of the carton. There further comprises a carton tightening apparatus to cause the opposing ends of the carton to overlap and securing means to cause the overlapping panels to engage thereby to secure the carton in a set up condition.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The machine according to the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in the drawings is capable of securing different types and shapes of carton and loading one or more articles, for example foodstuff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, and in particular <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown one example of a blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for forming an article carrier for receiving the or each article. The blank is made from suitable foldable sheet material, for example paperboard. In the illustrated example the blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of panels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> hingedly connected one to the next to form a wraparound package. The blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes opposed securing flaps <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to be secured together. Glue flaps are provided to secure the opposed end walls together. Panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided for forming end structures that are &ldquo;cup-like&rdquo; to receive and retain an article within the carton. Apertures <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are provided to receive lugs from the machine during carton construction described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is envisaged that the blanks can vary depending upon the shape and/or quantity of articles to be packaged and accordingly, a machine in accordance with the present invention is adjustable in numerous respects so that it can process a wide variety of such blanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for processing cartons from blanks, an example of which is outlined above. The packaging machine is capable of continuously setting up and loading cartons and comprises an article conveyor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for conveying articles A through the machine, carton feed apparatus <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sequentially to deliver successive blanks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from a supply in flat collapsed condition to a carton set-up station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the machine. One or more panel folding devices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are used to fold the blank so as to be wrapped around the article, support means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> adapted to be brought into contact with the carton during movement downstream so that the carton is maintained in a set up condition. An article loading station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided for loading at least one article into the part erected carton. Thereafter the ends of the carton are secured together at the carton securing station, before being returned to the conveyor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the outfeed end of the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Turning to the construction of the machine of the present invention in more detail; the upstream end of the machine is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> which shows the carton feed apparatus <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a hopper that holds a multiplicity of cartons C in flat collapsed condition are held ready for processing. The cartons are removed from the hopper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sequentially by a feed mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which in this embodiment is a rotary vacuum feeder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Whilst the use of a rotary vacuum feeder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to supply cartons to the conveyor is preferred, it is envisaged that the present invention can be used with other types of known feeder mechanisms without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the hopper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;gravity feed&rdquo; type whereby the carton blanks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are held in the hopper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at an incline to provide a positive feed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In use, the rotary feeder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> continuously and sequentially feeds cartons from the hopper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the infeed end of the machine and comprises a main shaft <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> mounted in a horizontal plane, that rotates pick up means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by the arrow &ldquo;A&rdquo;, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As the pick up means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> rotates, suction cups (not shown) are moved in contact with a wall of blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A vacuum is then applied to the set of suction cups by the vacuum supply, as is well known, and the blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is withdrawn and then transferred onto an endless conveyor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to move the carton downstream in a continuous forward direction to a carton set up station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and onto the loading station <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The carton set up station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of panel folding devices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that are used for blanks that are required to be folded into a wraparound structure. The folding devices are used to perform two folding actions on the carton. First the blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is gripped by gripping means, for example conveyor belts <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The first folding device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> folds the blank about the fold line between the panels <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and into a substantially perpendicular relationship such that panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is in a substantially vertical plane to be held in place by guide means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thereafter the second folding device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> causes the end structures formed from panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be set up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the folding device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in this embodiment, comprises a disc <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> mounted to suitable drive means (not shown), for example a servo motor. The motor is controlled by suitable control means, which can cause the rotational velocity of the disc to be varied. The disc <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is preferably &lsquo;segment&rsquo; shaped to define a leading edge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> that contacts the blank to commence the folding. Thereafter, the inner surface of the wheel abuts the panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to be folded and causes it to continue to be folded as described above. The panels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the blank are held in place by a fixed guide <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Second folding device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises a carton support lug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which is preferably shaped to conform to the shape of the end structure of the carton. In this embodiment, the lug is cup shaped to cause the end panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be formed and to support panels <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The carton support <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is mounted to an endless conveyor, for example a side lug chain assembly <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Thus, as the blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> engages the support lug the panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are caused to be folded out of alignment and thereby come into contact with the cupped surfaces. The end structure is formed into a recessed portion to receive part of the article at the loading station <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In order to complete the construction of the carton into a set up condition the part erected carton and lug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are moved downstream by the conveyor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The blank may be supported and moved forward by another suitable conveyor to maintain alignment between panels <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The side lug chain assembly is driven by a suitable drive means which is controlled by a controller. Fixed guides (not shown) may be provided to minimise upward movement of the carton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It will be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that the part erected carton C is pushed forward towards the loading station <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to be loaded with one or more articles. In this embodiment, the machine is adapted to load poultry into the carton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The articles are supplied to the loading station on a second conveyor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which runs parallel to and may be synchronised in the same direction X with the first conveyor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the articles are separated by known metering means. The present invention is also capable of switching between an operative condition, whereby articles A are selected from the conveyor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be transferred to the loading station, and an inoperative condition, whereby the articles pass through the machine on the conveyor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, without being packaged by an outer carton C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In an operative condition, an article transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided to push the selected articles towards the carton in direction Y, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, the mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of guide elements <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> mounted to an endless chain <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to impart lateral movement to the article thereby to remove it from the second conveyor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The endless chain <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is driven by suitable drive means to be synchronised with the article conveyor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and an intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be provided where, for example, the first and second conveyors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are not synchronised. The article is conveyed downstream to the transfer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the transfer device is an overhead chain assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a plurality of lugs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However other known types of conveyor can be used without departing from the scope of invention. The lugs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> engage the article and transfer the article in continuous forward movement to the loading station <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The lugs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are preferably synchronised with the movement of the carton C and are angled with respect to the forward movement to cause the article and carton to gradually engage as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the carton C and article continue downstream by the lug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and conveyor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the carton formation is continued, whereby guides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> engage panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to fold it about the article A to be wrapped around it as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The end panels <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the carton are secured together to complete the packaging process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the articles processed by the machine of the present invention are likely to vary in size, it is difficult to produce a standard carton for the article that will keep it securely packaged. Therefore it is desirable to incorporate another aspect of the invention which is a carton tightening device, designated as <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In broad terms, the device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> engages one end of the carton and pulls it towards the opposing end of the carton, until the carton reaches the desired level of tension. The ends <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are in an overlapping arrangement so that they can be secured together by glue or other suitable means known in the art. Therefore, if the article is small, the end panels <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the carton are caused to overlap by a greater distance than if the article is larger. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates two possible positions B and D of the position of end panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>: position B is when the article is large and position D is when the article is smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The preferred configuration of the carton tightening device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The device comprises a plurality of guide assemblies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> mounted on an endless conveyor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The endless conveyor is parallel to conveyor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the guide assemblies are moved in the same direction X as the article and carton. Suitable drive means drives the conveyor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a controller is provided to control the position and velocity of the guide assemblies so as to be synchronised with the carton C and lug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The guide assemblies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are moveable in a lateral plane by a cam track <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and cam follower <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> mounted to the guide assemblies. One preferred embodiment of assembly is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. The assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises one or more elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> mounted in a corresponding track <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to allow the elements to move in a planar direction Z (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Each element is mounted to a support member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which in turn is mounted to a shaft. The support member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is biased by biasing means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to be in an extended position designated as position K in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Biasing means may comprise a compression spring or other known suitable resilient biasing member. The body <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the guide assembly is mounted on a guide rail <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> to allow lateral movement as the cam follower follow the cam track <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In use, the elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are brought into alignment with the apertures <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the carton, by folding panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> out of alignment with panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The guide assembly is moved laterally by the path of the cam to cause the elements to engage the apertures <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Glue is applied to the panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by a glue gun <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and as the carton moves downstream, the guide assembly continues to move laterally towards the article A. This movement causes panels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to wrap around the article A and into overlapping relationship with panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The guide assemblies continue to move laterally so the carton panels become tensioned. The degree of tensioning is determined by the resilient means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, so that once the pack has reach the desired level of tension the springs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will compress which will cause the body <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to move in the opposite direction to the guide assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This action makes the upper planar face <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the guide assembly slide underneath panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and towards panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is brought into abutment with panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be secured therewith at position L on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Pressure is applied to the end flaps because the article is seated on face <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with the panels <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> placed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The cam track causes the lateral movement of the guide assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be reversed to facilitate the separation of the elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> from the carton and the biasing means causes the elements to return to the rest position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As the package moves along to the outfeed end of the machine the overlapping panels may be placed on a plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to aid the gluing process. Suitable guide means engages the package P, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and transfers it back to the article conveyor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the outfeed end. In this embodiment the guide means comprises an overhead chain assembly <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and lug <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a fixed guide <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a controller arranged to control the speed of the conveyors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during use so that packaging speeds of 40 to 60 pack per minute can be achieved. This controller may be a dedicated processor controlling the individual conveyors and the guide assembly or may be a control means for a packaging machine. Alternatively, the controller may preferably be a known, programmable servo control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the controller receives information from a sensor (not shown) arranged to detect the speed of the continuous conveyors; which may detect the speed of the belt and/or position of the article or carton directly. In addition the apparatus may include means in the form of a sensor for receiving information regarding the speed of the cartons on the conveyor which is transmitted to the control means. Alternatively, there may be manual input means through which the speed of the cartons on the feed path may be input into the control means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> By pre-programming the control system, the adjustments to the machine required to change from packaging one carton type to another carton type can be pre-set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, the speed of operation of the apparatus is improved as well as its efficiency and durability. An advantage of the present invention is the flexibility offered by the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The packaging machine is capable of switching from one carton type or size to another with a minimal down time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It will be recognised that the invention is not limited to cartons for poultry. The invention may be used with machines for packaging cans, paperboard &lsquo;bricks&rsquo;, bottles and other containers into cartons, but it is particularly useful where the article size may vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Further, the various elements of the machine, for example carton manipulating apparatus, folding apparatus, set up station, loading station or carton tightening means can be manufactured separately as a module to be incorporated into new machines or supplied on a retrofit basis without departing from the scope of invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the carton erecting mechanism and tightening mechanism of the invention has been illustrated with reference to a specific embodiment and that numerous modifications are possible within the scope of the invention. The carton tightening mechanism is able to process cartons comprising numerous configurations or groups of articles covering a range of carton size and shape, without undue time being spent in adjusting the mechanism. </paragraph>
