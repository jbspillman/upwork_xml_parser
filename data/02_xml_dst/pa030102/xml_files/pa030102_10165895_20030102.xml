<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for producing an item list of components for the assembly into a module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A module of the above type is, for example, a radiation detector of a computed tomography apparatus that has a number of identical detector modules as components. Each detector module in turn comprises a plurality of detector elements. The image-relevant physical properties of such detector elements, however, vary from detector module to detector module dependent on manufacture. In order to obtain a good image quality for CT images produced with the radiation detector, only detector modules whose image-relevant physical properties are matched optimally well to one another can be employed for the assembly of the radiation detector. For example, the image-relevant physical properties of the detector modules can be measured by the manufacturer before the detector modules are warehoused, the detector modules can be provided with a reference number and this information can be stored in a data bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When the manufacturer of the detector modules intends to assemble a radiation detector from the detector modules, for example, the manufacturer can determine suitable detector modules and their installation position with a method disclosed in German PS 198 11 044 corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,137,859. This method is based on the image-relevant physical properties of the detector modules that have been measured and stored being used in an automated manner with a computer program stored in a computer to select modules for assembling the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the manufacturer of the detector modules supplies detector modules to further manufacturers of radiation detectors who assemble radiation detectors from the delivered detector modules and would like to employ the physical properties of the detector modules measured by the manufacturer of the detector modules and the aforementioned computer program for determining suitable detector modules and their installation positions, the manufacturer of the detector modules must supply the further manufacturer of radiation detectors with the measured, image-relevant physical properties of the detector modules and with the computer program. The further manufacturers of radiation detectors then can install this computer program on their own computers and employ it. A disadvantage of this procedure, however, is that the computer program would have to be adapted to the conditions at the further manufacturers. Such an adaptation of the computer program is relatively complicated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method that allows for a facilitated assembly of the module from the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in a method for producing an item list of components for the assembly of a module including the components at a first location, wherein the components can be taken from a number of offered components, the offered components being provided with a reference number and being accessible from the first location, and wherein at least one individual property of each component is stored together with its reference number in a databank that is arranged at a second location different from the first location, including the following method steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> a) Generating an inquiry for producing the item list from the first location; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> b) Communicating the inquiry from the first location to the second location; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> c) Based on the inquiry and on the properties and reference numbers of the components stored in the databank, producing the item list at the second location, the item list includes an indicator for a property of each component correlated with the reference numbers for that component; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> d) Communicating the item list from the second location to the first location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An item list of components is required at the first location since the module is to be assembled thereat. Data needed for producing the item list, i.e. the individual property of each component accessible at the first location stored in the databank, however, are available only at the second location. The individual property can, for example, be an image-relevant physical property of a detector module when a radiation detector is to be assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> After the information to the effect that an item list is required has been communicated to the second location, the item list is produced at the second location on the basis of the information stored in the databank. The item list, which includes a particular about the components to be employed together with their reference numbers, is subsequently transmitted from the second location to the first location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Consequently, it is possible, based on information that is accessible only at the second location, to produce an item list of components that is required at another location, namely at the first location. The module can be assembled at the first location on the basis of this item list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> One advantage of this method is that the databank is arranged at a central location, i.e., the second location. This is especially advantageous when modules are to be assembled from the components at different first locations. The databank must then be implemented such that it takes only those components into consideration for producing the item list for a specific first location that are also accessible from this first location at which the module is to be assembled. The databank thus can be centrally maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the assembly of the module is followed by a final check at the first location, and the data allocated to the final check are communicated from the first location to the second location. Faulty component parts are recognized as faulty at the second location on the basis of the communicated data A suitable component as a replacement for a faulty component is determined from the number of components that are still available taking the property stored in the databank into consideration, and the reference number of the identified component is communicated from the second location to the first location. The final check is thus implemented at the first location but the evaluation thereof is implemented at the second location. If components are faulty, this is recognized at the second location; since the information about the components that are still available for selection and about their individual properties are also available there, a replacement for the faulty component can be identified at the second location. Subsequently, the reference number of the replacement is communicated from the second location to the first location, so that the faulty component can be replaced by a suitable component at the first location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The inquiry and the item list in one version of the invention are communicated via an information transmission network. According to one embodiment of the invention, the information transmission network can be the Internet or an Intranet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred version of the invention, the item list is produced by the manufacturer of the components. The manufacturer of the components thus can offer the production of the item list as a service and can thereby enhance the attractiveness of the components from that manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention the components are detector modules and the module is a radiation detector of a computed tomography apparatus. According to one version of the invention, further, the individual property of the detector module is an image-relevant physical property of the detector module, and the item list also includes a particular about an installation position of the detector module in the radiation detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An especially high image quality of CT images produced with the radiation detector can be achieved when, according to a further embodiment of the invention, the components and their installed positions in the radiation detector are determined at the second location on the basis of a computer program. This computer program can, in particular, be based on the method disclosed in the aforementioned German PS 198 11 044.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an assembly floor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with connected warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a manufacturer of radiation detectors. In the case of the present embodiment, approximately 200 detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed by detector elements are stored in the warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors are capable of assembling radiation detectors from the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> therefrom. In the exemplary embodiment, the manufacturer manufactures radiation detectors that have either <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (Type A), 42 detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (Type B) or 48 detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (Type C). The radiation detectors of the Type A, B and C thus mainly differ in terms of the number of detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are fabricated by a supplier in the supplier&apos;s factories <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are supplied to the manufacturer of radiation detectors. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the detector elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fabricated by the supplier differ slightly in terms of their image-relevant physical properties. So that the manufacturer of radiation detectors can assemble a radiation detector from the detector elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with which the manufacturer has been supplied, the radiation detector being suitable for producing CD images of high image quality, the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> employed for the assembled radiation detector must match one another with respect to the image-relevant physical properties. Employees <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the supplier therefore determine image-relevant physical properties of each and every detector module <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after the manufacture and before the delivery of the detector elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the manufacturer of radiation detectors, provide it with its reference number and store the reference number together with the physical properties of the corresponding detector module <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a databank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is located in a business office <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors wish to assemble a radiation detector of the type A, i.e. a radiation detector comprising <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A radiation detector of the type A is shown as an example schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is employed, for example, in computed tomography apparatus of the third generation. The radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a curved arrangement of&mdash;in the present exemplary embodiment&mdash;<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having the installed positions E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through E<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that are arranged such that they are impacted by an x-ray beam that emanates from the focus F of an x-ray source (not shown) and that is gated fan-shaped and whose edge rays are referenced RS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The central ray of the fan-shaped x-ray beam ZS&mdash;in a way that is standard in modern computed tomography systems&mdash;is not identical with the connecting straight line (referenced G) between the detector middle and the focus F, but is offset relative to this connecting straight line G. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The point C around which the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the x-ray source rotate in a known way during operation of the computed tomography apparatus lies on the central ray ZS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Before the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors assemble the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, they need an item list with which <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> suitable detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be selected from the warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the assembly of the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In order to obtain the item list, they use a computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> situated in the assembly floor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and connected to the Internet, the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a monitor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a keyboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a computer mouse <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, to contact an Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is located in the business office <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the supplier in the exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the Internet browser Netscape&reg; is stored in the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. After the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors have called the Internet browser Netscape&reg; with the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, have contacted the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the supplier with an Internet address allocated to the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and have verified their access authorization by means of an identifier allocated to the manufacturer of radiation detectors, an Internet page <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is built up on the monitor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Using the Internet page <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors can decide whether they wish to assemble a radiation detector of the type A, B or C in that using a mark that is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> but is well-known and can be mixed into the Internet page <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and moved with the computer mouse <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, they provide a box <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>allocated to the words Type A, Type B or Type C of the Internet page <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with an x. Since the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors given the present exemplary embodiment wish to assemble a radiation detector of the type A, they provide the box <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with an x. Subsequently, they click the field <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is provided with the word &ldquo;input&rdquo; with the computer mouse <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Subsequently, the information that the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors wish to assemble a radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the type A from the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> stored in the warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is communicated to the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the case of the present exemplary embodiment, a computer program is stored in the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that, moreover, is connected to the databank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the computer program (based on the method disclosed in German OS 198 11 044) determines detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> located in the warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and suitable for the assembly of the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> based on the inquiry of the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors and based on the image-relevant physical properties of the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplied to the manufacturer of radiation detectors that are stored in the databank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition to the suitable detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the computer program stored in the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also determines the corresponding installed positions E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through E<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the radiation detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> the identified detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> After the computer program has determined the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, their reference numbers and the corresponding installed positions E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through E<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the computer program generates an item list <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that is communicated from the Internet server to the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, an Internet page <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that comprises the item list <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and that is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is built up on the monitor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The item list <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has two columns <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The column <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a particular about the installed positions E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through E<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> identified by the computer program of the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the column <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> comprises a particular about the corresponding reference numbers of the identified detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors can get the corresponding detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and assemble the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After the employees <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer of radiation detectors have assembled the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, they check the correct functioning of the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a monitoring device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> that is connected to the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The data acquired during the check of the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are communicated after the end of the check event to the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the supplier with the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via the Internet, the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> recognizing incorrectly installed detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in an automated fashion by means of a computer program stored in the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the computer program determines a replacement for the faulty detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> based on the faulty detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, their installed positions and their image-relevant physical properties stored in the databank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and based on the other detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> installed in the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and on the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that are still available in the warehouse <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the computer program stored in the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generates an e-mail that is sent to the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and contains a particular about the faulty detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, their installed positions and their replacements including reference numbers. If none of the detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> installed in the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are faulty, the Internet server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> automatically generates an email having a particular to the effect that the assembled radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fault-free and sends this e-mail to the computer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A final check of the radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, moreover is optional for the inventive method. Instead of detector modules <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, individual detector elements can also be employed for the assembly of a radiation detector. The radiation detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> need not necessarily be a single-line radiation detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The inventive method is not limited to the assembly of a radiation detector. It can also be employed for the assembly of other modules, whereby the components needed for the assembly of the module need not necessarily be detector modules. </paragraph>
