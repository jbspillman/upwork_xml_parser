<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A half-fitting prevention connector includes a female connector having a flexible lock arm, a male connector for fitting into the female connector, and a fitting detection member which is mounted on the female connector to slide in a fitting direction of the two connectors, and a half-fitted condition of the two connectors is detected by determining whether or not the fitting detection member can be slidingly moved. The fitting detection member includes a deflection prevention rib which is formed at a rear end thereof to prevent the deflection of the lock arm in a completely-fitted condition. When the completely-fitted condition is achieved, this deflection prevention rib is slid under the lock arm to prevent the deflection of the flexible lock arm. Therefore, even when a load is applied to the flexible lock arm, the locked condition will not be canceled, thereby stabling maintaining the fitted condition. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a half-fitting prevention connector in which when a pair of male and female connector housings are fitted together, a half-fitted condition of the male and female connector housings is detected by determining whether or not a fitting detection member, mounted on one of the connector housings, can be slid into a proper fitting detection position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a conventional half-fitting prevention connector shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, when a pair of male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are fitted together, a half-fitted condition of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is detected by determining whether or not a fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, mounted on the male connector housing (first connector housing) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, can be slid into a proper fitting detection position (see JP-A-8-31517). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the male connector housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> rising from an upper wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a front end thereof and further extending toward a rear end of the housing, and a lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed on an intermediate portion of an upper surface of this flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a projected manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A pressing plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided at a free end of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed near to the rear end of the male connector housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and this pressing plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> serves as an operating portion for elastically displacing the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> when fitting the male and female connector housings together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The female connector housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has an engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed on an inner surface of an upper wall thereof at a front end thereof which upper wall overlies the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> when fitting the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, when the length of fitting of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> relative to each other reaches a proper value, the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> slides over the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the elastic displacement of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the length of fitting of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> reaches the proper value, the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes engaged in a recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>disposed at the rear side of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, from the upper side, to retain the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby locking the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in a fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes an operating plate portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is slidably engaged with the pressing plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so as to slide in a fitting direction of the male and female connector housings, a resilient piece portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, extending from a rear end of the operating plate portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> toward the front ends of the male and female connector housings, and a positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> formed at a distal end of the resilient piece portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in a projected manner, these portions being formed integrally with one another. The resilient piece portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a bar-like shape, and can pass through a space between a pair of side plate portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in the form of a projection, and can be fitted into each of recesses <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>disposed respectively at the rear and front sides of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, from the lower side by the resilient force of the resilient piece portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Before the male and female connector housings are fitted together, this positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is kept fitted in the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the rear side of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is retained by a rear edge of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and therefore is prevented form forward movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The position where the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is abutted against the rear edge of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is prevented from forward movement is an initial position of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> mounted on the male connector housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With respect to the sliding engagement between the pressing plate portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the operating plate portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the sliding range is so determined that the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can slide between the proper fitting detection position, set forwardly of the above initial position, and this initial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the pair of male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are fitted together, the length of fitting of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> reaches the proper value, so that the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fitted in the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the rear side of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, already fitted in the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>is downwardly pushed out of this recess by the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that the holding of the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the initial position is canceled. As a result, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be slid by pushing the operating plate portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forward as indicated by arrow A in the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pushed forward after the holding of the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the initial position is canceled, this positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves forward in sliding contact with the lower surfaces of the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Then, when the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves past the front edge of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, this portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is displaced upwardly by the resilient force of the resilient piece portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and is fitted into the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the front side of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thus fitted in the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>is retained at its rear end surface by the front end surface of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is held in a locked condition, that is, prevented from rearward sliding movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, if the length of fitting of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> does not reach the proper value, thus inviting a half-fitted condition, when the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are fitted together, the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the female connector housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will not be fitted into the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the rear side of the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the positioning retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will not be pushed out of the recess <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the engagement portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and therefore the holding of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the initial position by the lock portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will not be canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the half-fitted condition of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, even when the operating plate portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pushed forward, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will not be moved forward, and therefore the half-fitted condition can be detected by determining whether or not the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be moved forward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> After the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are fitted together, the operating plate portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is exposed, and therefore there was encountered a problem that when an external force of above a predetermined level acted on the operating plate portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the upper side, the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> was elastically deformed (since a deflection space was provided between the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the male connector housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), so that the locking of the male and female connector housings <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to each other was canceled,. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This invention has been made in view of the above problem, and an object of the invention is to provide a half-fitting prevention connector in which the deflection of a lock arm is prevented in a completely-fitted condition, thereby stably maintaining the fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The above object has been achieved by a half-fitting prevention connector of the invention of claim <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> a first connector housing having a flexible lock arm; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> a second connector housing which has an engagement portion for engagement with a lock portion of the flexible lock arm, and is connected to the first connector housing by the engagement of the lock portion with the engagement portion when the second connector housing is fitted relative to the first connector housing; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> a fitting detection member which is mounted on the first connector housing so as to slide in a fitting direction of the first and second connector housings, a half-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings being detected by determining whether or not the fitting detection member can be slidingly moved; characterized in that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> the fitting detection member includes a detection member body, which is fitted on an outer periphery of the first connector housing so as to slide in the fitting direction of the first and second connector housings, a positioning retaining portion for engagement with the lock portion to hold the detection member body in an initial position, and a deflection prevention rib which is formed at a rear end of the fitting detection member so as to prevent the deflection of the lock arm in a completely-fitted condition; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> when the first and second connector housings are completely fitted together, the positioning retaining portion is pushed out of the lock portion upon engagement of the engagement portion with the lock portion, so that the engagement of the positioning retaining portion with the lock portion is canceled; and when the detection member body is slid from the initial position to a proper fitting detection position generally near to a front end of the first connector housing, the positioning retaining portion is engaged with a detection member-retaining portion, formed at a distal end of the lock arm, thereby holding the fitting detection member in the proper fitting detection position, and also the deflection prevention rib is slid under the lock arm to prevent the deflection of the lock arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the half-fitting prevention connector of the above construction, the deflection prevention rib for preventing the deflection of the lock arm in the completely-fitted condition is formed at the rear end of the fitting detection member mounted on the first connector housing, and when the completely-fitted condition is achieved, the deflection prevention rib slides under the lock arm to prevent the deflection of the lock arm. Therefore, even when a load is applied to the lock arm, the locked condition will not be canceled, thereby stably maintaining the fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The deflection prevention rib may take any suitable form, and does not always need to extend between the opposite side walls of the detection member body in so far as it can generally fill up a deflection space for the flexible lock arm. Namely, the deflection prevention rib may be interrupted intermediate the opposite side walls of the detection member body, and may comprise two cantilever sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the half-fitting prevention connector of the invention of claim <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> depending from claim <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the first connector housing has a first projection formed on that portion of an outer peripheral surface thereof facing away from the flexible lock arm, and the fitting detection member has a second projection which is formed on an inner peripheral surface thereof so as to be engaged with the first projection in the completely-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings, and when the first connector housing is completely fitted with the second connector housing, the fitting detection member moves toward the front side of the first connector housing, so that the second projection slides past the first projection, and is engaged therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the half-fitting prevention connector of this construction, the first connector housing has the first projection formed on that portion of the outer peripheral surface thereof facing away from the flexible lock arm, and the fitting detection member has the second projection which is formed on the inner peripheral surface thereof so as to be engaged with the first projection in the completely-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings, and when the first connector housing is completely fitted with the second connector housing, the fitting detection member moves toward the front side of the first connector housing, so that the second projection slides past the first projection, and is engaged therewith. Thus, the positioning retaining portion is engaged with the detection member-retaining portion, formed at the distal end of the lock arm, and in addition the first projection is engaged with the second projection. Therefore, the force of retaining of the fitting detection member on the first connector housing in the completely-fitted condition increases, thereby more firmly holding the fitting detection member in the proper fitting detection position. And besides, when the first projection and the second projection are engaged with each other, a click feeling is produced, and the completely-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings can be detected also by this click feeling.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a half-fitting prevention connector of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exploded, perspective view of one preferred embodiment of the half-fitting prevention connector of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a condition in which a fitting detection member is mounted on a female connector housing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a vertical cross-sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a condition in which the female and male connector housings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are in the process of being fitted together, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a vertical cross-sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a vertical cross-sectional view showing the female and male connector housings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in a completely-fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the half-fitting prevention connector <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of this embodiment comprises a female connector (first connector housing) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, having a flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a male connector (the second connector housing) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having an engagement projection (engagement portion) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for engagement in a retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (serving as a lock portion) formed in the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of a generally tubular shape mounted on the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to slide in a fitting direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Before the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are fitted together, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is engaged in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and therefore is held in its initial position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. When the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are completely fitted together, the retaining of the fitting detection member by the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is canceled by engagement of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the fitting detection member is slid from the initial position to a proper fitting detection position spaced a predetermined distance from the initial position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. Therefore, a half-fitted condition of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be detected by determining whether or not the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be slid into the proper fitting detection position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes a housing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>having terminal receiving chambers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for respectively receiving and holding female connection terminals (not shown), the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, formed on an upper surface of the housing body, and guide portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for slidably supporting the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, these portions being molded integrally with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes an arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> formed on upper ends of support post portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed on a generally central portion of the upper surface of the housing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extends in a forward-rearward direction relative to the housing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and can be elastically displaced upward and downward on the support post portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> serving as a fulcrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed through that portion of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> disposed near to the front end thereof. Cancellation operating portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for upwardly displacing the front end of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are formed on that portion of the upper surface of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent to the rear end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the fitted condition of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is engaged in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, when the cancellation operating portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are depressed to displace the front end of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> upwardly, the engagement of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The guide portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are formed respectively at opposite sides of the upper surface of the housing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in such a manner that the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is disposed between these guide portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Each of the guide portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has a guide groove <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in an outer surface thereof and extending in the forward-rearward direction of the housing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of this embodiment has a first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of a rib-like shape formed on that portion of the outer peripheral surface thereof facing away from the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending transversely, that is, in a direction perpendicular to the fitting direction. Preferably, the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has a triangular cross-sectional shape, having gently-slanting surfaces, or a semi-circular cross-sectional shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The male connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes a housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having terminal receiving chambers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for respectively receiving male connection terminals (not shown), and the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for engagement in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed on an upper surface of this housing body, and elongate projections <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> each for passing through a gap <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> between the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the corresponding guide portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is also formed on this upper surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The terminal receiving chambers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>receive and hold the male connection terminals (not shown) which are to be connected respectively to the female connection terminals received respectively in the terminal receiving chambers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and these terminal receiving chambers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are arranged at the same pitch as that of the terminal receiving chambers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed on and projects from that portion of the upper surface of the housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed near to the front end thereof. When the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are fitted together, the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> moves into sliding contact with the lower surface of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Then, when the length of fitting of the female and male connectors relative to each other reaches a predetermined value, this engagement projection is fitted into the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the lower side of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and is thus engaged in this retaining hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The elongate projections <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are passed respectively through the gaps <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, provided in the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby controlling the fitting direction of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the fitting positions thereof so that the operation for fitting the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> together can be carried out smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes a detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of a generally tubular shape, which is fitted on the outer periphery of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to slide in the fitting direction of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> together, and covers the outer periphery of the hosing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> (serving as a positioning retaining portion) for engagement in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to hold the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in the initial position, a deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed at a rear end of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> so as to prevent the deflection of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the completely-fitted condition, and a second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of a boss-like shape formed on the inner peripheral surface of the detection member body so as to be engaged with the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the completely-fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Guide projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for being slidably fitted respectively in the guide grooves <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the guide portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are formed respectively on inner side surfaces of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and this detection member body is mounted on the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to slide in the fitting direction of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the guide projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>fitted respectively in the guide grooves <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Anti-slip portions <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which are to be held by the fingers when sliding the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, are formed respectively on opposite outer side surfaces of this detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is formed on and projects from a lower surface of a retaining arm (resilient piece portion) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which is part of an upper wall of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, at a front end thereof, and this retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> can be resiliently displaced upward. This retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is fitted into the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the upper side, with its front end surface held against a front end surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, thereby holding the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in its initial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Arm projections <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed respectively at opposite sides of the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and when the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is engaged with the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, these arm projections <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are engaged respectively in retaining recesses <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are formed in the housing body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and are disposed respectively at opposite sides of the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the front end of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed downwardly to thereby cancel the engagement of the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> before fitting the female connector onto the male connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will not be disengaged from the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the proper fitting detection position, to which the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid, is set at a position which is nearer relative to the front end of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> than the initial position (where the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is retained by the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is. Therefore, the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with a detection member-retaining portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> for limiting the sliding movement of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when this fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid from the initial position forwardly to the proper fitting detection position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The detection member-retaining portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is defined by the front end edge of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and when the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid to the proper fitting detection position, this detection member-retaining portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> retains a rear gentely-slanting surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) of the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, thereby locating and fixing the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the proper fitting detection position. At this time, a click feeling is produced upon retaining engagement of the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> with the detection member-retaining portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and therefore the completely-fitted condition of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disposed immediately adjacent to the rear end of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and extends between opposite side walls of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. When the completely-fitted condition is achieved, this rib slides under the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As a result, the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> fills up a deflection space, and therefore even when a load is applied to the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is prevented from being elastically deformed. The deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may take any suitable form, and does not always need to extend between the opposite side walls of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in so far as it can generally fill up the deflection space for the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Namely, the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be interrupted intermediate the opposite side walls of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and may comprise two cantilever sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A groove for receiving the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in the completely-fitted condition is formed at the rear end portion of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and this groove extends in the fitting direction. This groove has such a depth that the rear end of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> lies generally flush with the rear end of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the completely-fitted condition. The height of this groove is generally equal to the height of the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so that the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, when fitted in the groove, will not jolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is provided on the inner peripheral surface of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and when the completely-fitted condition is to be achieved, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is moved toward the front side of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> slides past the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and is engaged therewith. Preferably, those surfaces of the first and second projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, which are brought into contact with each other when the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is moved from the initial position to the proper fitting detection position, are gently slanting so that the two contact surfaces can be easily engaged with each other. Also, those surfaces of the first and second projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, which contact each other when the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves rearwardly from the proper fitting detection position, are abruptly slanting in order to prevent the rearward movement of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the completely-fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With this construction, the force of retaining the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> relative to each other is increased, and the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be more firmly held in the proper fitting detection position. And besides, when the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are engaged with each other, a click feeling is produced, and the completely-fitted condition of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be detected also by this click feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, the fitting operation for the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. First, before the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are fitted together, the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, formed on and projecting from the lower surface of the retaining arm (resilient piece portion) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (which is part of the upper wall of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) at the front end thereof, is fitted into the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the upper side, with its front end surface held against the front end surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, thereby holding the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in its initial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> For fitting the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> together, the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, formed on and projecting from that portion of the upper surface of the housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed near to the front end thereof, advances in sliding contact with the lower surface of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. When the length of fitting of the female and male connectors relative to each other reaches the predetermined value, the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is fitted into the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the lower side of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and therefore is engaged in this retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> At this time, the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, already engaged in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, is pushed upwardly out of this retaining hole by the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrow B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, thereby canceling the holding of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the initial position. Therefore, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be moved toward the front side of the housing of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Then, when the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid to the proper fitting detection position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the detection member-retaining portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, defined by the front end edge of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, retains the rear end surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, thereby holding the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the proper fitting detection position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When the completely-fitted condition is achieved, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid to the proper fitting detection position, so that the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, extending between the opposite side walls of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> at the rear end portion thereof, slides under the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and fills up the deflection space. As a result, even when a load is applied to the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, this flexible lock arm is prevented from being elastically deformed since the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> fills up the deflection space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> And besides, when the completely-fitted condition is achieved, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves toward the front side of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> slides past the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and is engaged therewith, thereby more firmly holding the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the proper fitting detection position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are completely fitted together, and the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is held in the proper fitting detection position, and in this condition the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid rearwardly from the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, so that the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the deflection space below the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the cancellation operating portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are pressed down, thereby displacing the front end of the arm portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. By doing so, the engagement of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the retaining hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be canceled, and the fitted condition of the female and male connectors can be cancelled. When the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is moved rearward, the rear gently-slanting surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the retaining projection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> slides over the detection member-retaining portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the half-fitting prevention connector <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extends between the opposite side walls of the detection member body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> at the rear end portion thereof, and when the completely-fitted condition is achieved, this rib slides under the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As a result, the deflection prevention rib <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> fills up the deflection space, and therefore even when a load is applied to the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, this flexible lock arm is prevented from being elastically deformed. Therefore, even when an external force is applied to the cancellation operating portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the flexible lock arm <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> will not be elastically deformed, and therefore the fitted condition of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will not be canceled, and this fitted condition can be stably maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> And besides, when the completely-fitted condition is to be achieved, the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves toward the front side of the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> slides past the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and is engaged therewith. As a result, the force of retaining of the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the female connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> increases, thereby more firmly holding the fitting detection member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the proper fitting detection position. In addition, when the first projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the second projection <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are engaged with each other, a click feeling is produced, and the completely-fitted condition of the female and male connectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be detected also by this click feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the half-fitting prevention connector of the present invention, the fitting detection member includes the detection member body, which is fitted on the outer periphery of the first connector housing so as to slide in the fitting direction of the first and second connector housings, the positioning retaining portion for engagement with the lock portion to hold the detection member body in the initial position, and the deflection prevention rib which is formed at the rear end of the fitting detection member so as to prevent the deflection of the lock arm in the completely-fitted condition. When the first and second connector housings are completely fitted together, the positioning retaining portion is pushed out of the lock portion upon engagement of the engagement portion with the lock portion, so that the engagement of the positioning retaining portion with the lock portion is canceled. When the detection member body is slid from the initial position to the proper fitting detection position generally near to the front end of the first connector housing, the positioning retaining portion is engaged with the detection member-retaining portion, formed at the distal end of the lock arm, thereby holding the fitting detection member in the proper fitting detection position, and also the deflection prevention rib is slid under the lock arm to prevent the deflection of the lock arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the half-fitting prevention connector of the above construction, the deflection prevention rib for preventing the deflection of the lock arm in the completely-fitted condition is formed at the rear end of the fitting detection member mounted on the first connector housing, and when the completely-fitted condition is achieved, the deflection prevention rib slides under the lock arm to prevent the deflection of the lock arm. Therefore, even when a load is applied to the lock arm, the locked condition will not be canceled, thereby stably maintaining the fitted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the half-fitting prevention connector of the invention, having the above construction, the first connector housing has the first projection formed on that portion of the outer peripheral surface thereof facing away from the flexible lock arm, and the fitting detection member has the second projection which is formed on the inner peripheral surface thereof so as to be engaged with the first projection in the completely-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings. When the first connector housing is completely fitted with the second connector housing, the fitting detection member moves toward the front side of the first connector housing, so that the second projection slides past the first projection, and is engaged therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the half-fitting prevention connector of this construction, the first connector housing has the first projection formed on that portion of the outer peripheral surface thereof facing away from the flexible lock arm, and the fitting detection member has the second projection which is formed on the inner peripheral surface thereof so as to be engaged with the first projection in the completely-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings. When the first connector housing is completely fitted with the second connector housing, the fitting detection member moves toward the front side of the first connector housing, so that the second projection slides past the first projection, and is engaged therewith. Thus, the positioning retaining portion is engaged with the detection member-retaining portion, formed at the distal end of the lock arm, and in addition the first projection is engaged with the second projection. Therefore, the force of retaining of the fitting detection member on the first connector housing in the completely-fitted condition increases, thereby more firmly holding the fitting detection member in the proper fitting detection position. And besides, when the first projection and the second projection are engaged with each other, a click feeling is produced, and the completely-fitted condition of the first and second connector housings can be detected also by this click feeling. </paragraph>
