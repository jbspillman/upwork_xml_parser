<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns inflatable sachets containing an effervescent dry powder activatable to release gases and thereby outwardly billow the sachet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. The Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Cleansing products have traditionally been marketed in the form of bar soaps, shower gels and mousses, the lather being generated by mechanical and aerosol dispensers. Mechanical implements have been used by consumers to assist in lather formation and physical removal of dirt through scrubbing. Wash cloths have been the implement of choice throughout recent history. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> New formats for cleansing hold great consumer appeal. For instance, surfactant and conditioner compositions have been layered into apertured wipes such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,280,757 (McAtee et al.). Open-mesh sponges such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,607 (Gordon et at.) have assisted in generating foam from shower gels thereby improving speed and quality of lathering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.) describes a substantially dry, disposable personal care article wherein a surfactant system is dried onto a water-insoluble non-woven or similar substrate. A second generation of duat layered towelette has been reported. See WO 00/42961 (Smith), WO 01/08542 (Cen et al.), WO 01/08640 (Smith et al.), WO 01/08641 (Lorenzi et al.), WO 01/08655 (Phipps et at.), WO 01/08656 (Lorenzi et at.), WO 01/08657 (Lorenzi et at.) and WO 01/08658 (Cawkwell et at.) all describing disposable personal cleansing towelettes with lathering surfactant on at least a two layer cloth with one layer being a high loft substrate. Consumers are expected to place the towelette under water to generate a surfactant lather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another approach is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,390 (Farrell et al.) which reports a wiping article structured as a pouch containing an effervescent cleanser composition. At least one of the pouch walls are water permeable. When wetted with water, the composition components of an acid material and an alkaline material effervesce to generate carbon dioxide, as well as exuding copious amounts of lather from a surfactant component. A plumped &ldquo;pillow&rdquo; arises from the effervescent action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> EP 0 836 842 B1 (Moore et al.) discloses oval shaped disposable non-woven cleaning articles. These are formed of hydro-entangled fibers wherein entanglement is oriented in a direction parallel to the major axis of the oval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Elongate shaped pouches are particularly suitable for gripping; they tend to more ergonomically fit within the hand. For the present invention, an effervescent sachet system was sought which would be easily grippable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A problem encountered with sachets formed from non-woven materials is their tendency to pucker. When the dry effervescent composition is activated with water, the resultant evolution of gases inflates the sachet into a bulging pillow arrangement. Deformation of the sachet watts results in a substantial pucker of the pillow configuration. Both for aesthetic and ergonomic reasons, the pucker is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cosmetic article with an activatable effervescent cleansing system which upon inflation by effervescent gases causes the article to inflate but avoids deformation and puckering of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the subsequently described invention is broader than the objects or technical problems it is directed to solve. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Now it has been found that proper orientation of fibers in a non-woven web forming a wall of the pouch can avoid the problem of puckering. Upon release of gases through water activation of the effervescent composition, the walls of the pouch billow outwardly. Directed orientation of the entangled fibers forming a web which is at least part of the pouch wall allows the system to stretch thereby avoiding deformation and any substantial puckering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a first embodiment wherein the pouch is oval shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The pouch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has walls formed by a first spun lace web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a second meltblown composite web <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the latter being bonded to a high loft sheet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The webs forming webs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are non-woven entangled fiber matrices. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> best illustrates by cross-section the several webs constituting the walls. Chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed between the first and second webs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> serves to confine a powdered effervescent composition <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Webs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are ultrasonically sealed along a circumferential track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to insure no loss of the powdered composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Pouch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is defined by a major axis M oriented in a longitudinal direction and a minor axis N oriented in a Lateral direction, the major axis being longer than the minor one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a second embodiment of the invention. It illustrates a crescent-shaped sachet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Major and minor axes, (M&prime; and N&prime;), are outlined on the Figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a third embodiment according to the present invention. Sachet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along one edge has a sinusoidal shape <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and along an opposite edge a straight configuration <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Major and minor axes are identified as M&Prime; and N&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> provide particularly useful curvilinear edges because of their more grippable and less slip-prone configuration relative to that of an oval. Yet the problem of puckering is particularly aggravated in configurations having concave edges such as identified by <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a fourth embodiment. Sachet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the ends of the major axis M&prime;&Prime; has a straight edge <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and at opposite ends a rounded edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Minor axis N&prime;&Prime; traverses the major axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Copious foam is generated when pouch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wetted with water, much in the same manner as a toilet bar is lathered. Physically, the pouch is constructed in an oval shape with a size fittable within a human hand thereby simulating a toilet bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;major axis&rdquo; refers to the longitudinal direction or length and is defined as the direction parallel to the longitudinal center line of the sachet. Normally the major axis coincides with the material direction (MD) along which the web is produced. In other words, as fibers are laid down they are conveyed as a web away from the depositing source in a MD movement. The term &ldquo;minor axis&rdquo; refers to the lateral direction or width and is defined as the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal center line of the sachet. Normally the minor axis coincides with the cross direction (CD) arranged orthogonal to the MD along which the web is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Tensile Strength of nonwovens is ordinarily strongest in the machine direction. Entanglement oriented webs of the present invention seek to improve strength in the CD relative to the MD length. However, the resultant oriented webs will not necessarily exhibit higher tensile strength in the CD than MD length; but tensile strength differences will have been narrowed. For instance, a spun lace fabric may be formed from fiber deposition that is CD to MD in a tensile strength ratio of circa 1:4. Subsequent hydroentanglement orientation enhances the ratio to circa 1:2. Preferably orientation of entangled fibers will increase tensile strength by at least 20%, more preferably by at least 50%, and optimally by at least 100% in CD versus MD value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Typical dimensions for the major axis may range from about 20 mm to about 300 mm, preferably from about 30 to about 100 mm. Dimensions of the minor axis may range from about 30 to about 85 mm, preferably from about 20 to about 50 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Orientation of the fibers of the present invention is not limited to any particularly technique. In fact, any technique known in the art can be employed to gain the desired orientation effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pouch comprises at least one web of entangled fibers. The entangled fibers are entangled in a direction perpendicular to the major axis of the pouch. The preferred method of manufacturing entangled fibers utilizes a process known as hydroentangling. A hydroentangled web that is strong and durable is produced by traversing material fibers with high energy jet streams of water in order to interlock the fibers. Other high pressure fluids can be used in place of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although hydroentangling is preferred as the method of producing the entangled web, other methods can alternatively be employed. Needlepunching is an example of a method which can be employed. In this method, barbed needles are punched through the web, hooking tufts of fibers across it and thereby bonding it in the needlepunched areas. Another method which can be utilized is thermal bonding, in which the fibers are of thermoplastic material, or have an outer layer of thermoplastic material, and are bonded together in discrete spots by heat. A web produced in this way is unlikely to be as soft as one produced by hydroentangling, or needlepunching, and it may have a substantial proportion of completely loose fibers. Yet another method involves wet-laying a mixture of fibers and chemical binder, somewhat in the manner employed, for example, in paper making. Yet a further method is carding, in which staple fibers are opened, cleaned, aligned and formed into a continuous unbonded web. White hydroentangling, and chemically, thermally, mechanically bonded materials and carded materials are representative of the technologies which can be incorporated in the present invention, these do not exhaust all the possibilities. Other technologies such as embossing, creping and aperturing can be incorporated into the manufacture of the pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Web <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be a single meltblown web but preferably it is a combination of several layers forming a composite web. One embodiment utilizes the three layers of spunbond/meltblown/spunbond (SMS) and another utilizes four layers representing spunbond/meltblown/meltblown/spunbond (SMMS) construction. In these systems the meltblown fibers are very compact and act as a barrier against loss of powder. The spunbond layers are provided for strength and softness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The meltblown web can be any meltblown web made from a thermoplastic polymer having a melting point greater than about 50&deg; C. A preferred polymer is polypropylene, which is the most commonly used polymer for making meltblown webs. Other suitable polymers include poly(butylene terephthalate), polycaprolactam, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polyethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The process for making meltblown webs is well known in the art and is used extensively for manufacturing a wide variety of commercial nonwoven products. Representative examples of the meltblowing process are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,978,185 to Buntin et al. dated Aug. 31, 1976; U.S. Pat. No. 4,298,649 to Meitner dated Nov. 3, 1981; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al. dated Jul. 11, 1978, all herein incorporated by reference. It will be appreciated, however, that other meltblowing processes will produce webs suitable for purposes of this invention. The meltblown web can be combined or laminated to other supporting webs, such as spunbonded webs, in order to impart strength or other attributes to the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The basis weight for a single sheet of the meltblown base webs of this invention can range from about 20 to about 300 grams per square meter. Preferably the basis weight will be from about 80 to about 250, and most preferably from about 100 to about 200 grams per square meter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Spunbonding entails extruding a multiplicity of continuous thermoplastic polymer strands through a multiplicity of die orifices in a downward direction onto a moving surface where the extruded strands are collected in randomly distributed fashion. The randomly deposited strands are then bonded together in a heated nip to provide sufficient integrity to the resulting nonwoven web of continuous fibers. Spunbonded webs are characterized by a high strength/weight ratio, isotropic strength, high porosity, and good abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Meltblowing differs from spunbonding in that the extruded polymer strands are broken up and dispersed into individual fibers by a forced air stream before being deposited onto the collecting surface. In addition, the fibers are substantially cooled by the air so that they do not significantly crystallize and/or bond together. Bonding of the web to retain integrity and strength occurs as a separate downstream operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A most preferred material for the second web <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is a non-woven meltblown/spunbond substrate available from the Polyprop Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The first web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> preferably is either a spun lace or a carded/chemically bonded non-woven water-insoluble material. Particularly preferred is a cloth NC008 (Image Spun Lace) available from the PGI Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When present, a high loft sheet may be utilized as the water-permeable wall. As used herein, &ldquo;high loft&rdquo; means that the sheet has a density of from about 0.00005 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to about 0.1 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, preferably from about 0.001 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to about 0.09 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and a thickness of from about 0.1 cm to about 5 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;nonwoven&rdquo; means that the layer does not comprise fibers which are woven into a fabric. The term &ldquo;curvilinear&rdquo; means that at least one edge defining the pouch is a curved surface. Preferably the pouch exhibits no squared corners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For purposes of this invention, the most preferred high loft material is a needle punched composite sold by Union Wadding Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Sachets of the present invention may be produced by depositing a charge of effervescent powder through a funnel nozzle onto an oriented nonwoven web as it moves in a horizontal manner. Downstream a similarly oriented hydro-entangled web is unfurled from a roll and travels in a direction above and parallel to that of the first web. The parallel webs and deposited effervescent powder then pass underneath a stamping station which heat seals in an oval pattern the first and second webs together with the effervescent powder charge between the web walls. Subsequently, a cutter die punches out the heat sealed oval article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> One or more of the articles may then be packaged within a moisture impermeable outer package such as a laminated foil bag to prevent activation of the effervescent system during storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Ultrasonic welding may be employed as an alternative to heat-sealing of the first and second substrates together. Thread stitching, glue application or other closure mechanisms may also be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A first component of compositions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the pouch is that of an acidic material. Suitable for this purpose are any acids, and preferably those present in dry solid form. Especially appropriate are C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>organic mono- and poly-carboxylic acids and especially alpha- and beta-hydroxycarboxylic acids; C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>organophosphorus acids such as phytic acid; C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>organosulfur acids such as toluene sulfonic acid; and peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide. Typical hydroxycarboxylic acids include adipic, glutaric, succinic, tartaric, malic, maleic, lactic, salicylic and citric acids as well as acid forming lactones such as gluconolactone and glucarolactone. Most preferred is citric acid. Also suitable as acid material may be encapsulated acids. Typical encapsulating material may include water soluble synthetic or natural polymers such as polyacrylates (e.g. encapsulating polyacrylic acid), cellulosic gums, polyurethane and polyoxyalkylene polymers. By the term &ldquo;acid&rdquo; is meant any substance which when dissolved in deionized water at 1% concentration will have a pH of less than 7, preferably less than 6.5, optimally less than 5. These acids preferably at 25&deg; C. are in solid form, i.e. having melting points no less than 25&deg; C. Concentrations of the acid should range from about 0.5 to about 80%, preferably from about 10 to about 65%, optimally from about 20 to about 45% by weight of the total composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A second component of compositions within the pouch is that of an alkaline material. The alkaline material is a substance which can generate a gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen or oxygen, i.e. effervesce, when contacted with water and the acidic material.

Unlike laundry sachet articles, pouches of the present invention should not rupture to allow dispersion of their granular contents into wash water. Rather it is intended for all composition components to exit by dissolution through the permeable walls of the pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Skin surfaces against which articles of the present invention are useful include face, body, scalp, axilla and even legs/feet. When the article is a foot cleanser, it would be advantageous for the pouch on one of its sides to be coarse while the second of the substrates may be soft and gentle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material are to be understood as modified by the word &ldquo;about&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The following examples will more fully illustrate embodiments of this invention. All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise indicated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> An effervescent cleansing composition was prepared according to the formulation reported in Table 1. Phase A was dry blended in a high speed shearing mixer. Fragrance was then sprayed onto the resultant powder as a Phase B. Three grams of the resultant powder are then placed into a pocket of a 5 cm by 8 cm oval pouch. Walls of the pouch are formed by heat sealing the circumferences of a non-woven spun lace web to a non-woven SMMS composite web. The spun lace web is a material whose fibers have been oriented in a direction perpendicular of the major axis of the pouch (i.e. in the cross direction).

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A still further effervescent cleansing composition according to the present invention may be prepared according to the formulation reported under Table IV. The dry mixed ingredients at a weight level of 3.5 grams per sample are placed into a moon-shaped pouch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> with lengths along major and minor (width) axis of 9 cm and 5.5 cm. The powdered sample is placed between a layer of spuntace web and an SMS layer to which a high loft sheet is sealed. The webs of spuntace and SMS are arranged to have their fibers oriented cross to the major axis direction. All sides of the pouch are welded by ultrasonic heat to ensure against powder escaping.
