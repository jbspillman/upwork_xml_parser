<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical recording medium that has a recording layer made of an organic compound and with which recording and playback is possible using a laser beam having a specific wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A CD-R is a writable, optical information recording medium (optical disc) on which information can be written only once by irradiation with laser light, and is widely known. This medium is advantageous in that information recorded on the CD-R can be played back using a commercial CD player, and the demand for CD-Rs has been escalating recently with the spread of personal computers. Further, writable digital versatile discs (DVD-Rs), on which digital high-vision images can be recorded, have also been put to practical use as media having a larger recording capacity than CD-Rs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such writable optical recording media typically comprise a disc substrate having successively disposed thereon a light-reflective layer (formed of, for example, Au), a recording layer formed of an organic compound, and a resin layer (may be referred to as a &ldquo;cover layer&rdquo; below) including an adhesive for adherence to the recording layer. Information is recorded on the disc by irradiating the disc with a laser from the side of the disc at which the resin layer is disposed. Specifically, the portion of the recording layer that is irradiated absorbs light, whereby temperature increases at the irradiated portion. The local increase in temperature deforms the recording layer (e.g., formation of pits) at the irradiated portion, whereby information is recorded. The recorded information is ordinarily reproduced by irradiating the disc with a laser having the same wavelength as that of the laser used to record the information, and by detecting a difference in reflectance between the region of the recording layer that has been deformed (recorded portion) and the region of the recording layer that has not been deformed (unrecorded portion). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recently, high-vision television and networks such as the Internet have rapidly become more wide spread. In addition, the start of HDVT (High Definition Television) broadcasting is near at hand. As a result, large-capacity optical recording media capable of recording visual information easily and inexpensively are in demand. While DVD-Rs currently play a significant role as large-capacity recording media, the demand for media having greater recording capacity and higher density continues to escalate, and development of recording media that can cope with this demand is also needed. For this reason, development of recording media having ever greater storage capacity with which high-density recording can be effected with short wave light continues to advance. In particular, writable optical recording media on which information can be recorded only once are frequently used to backup or store large volumes of information over a long period of time. Therefore, the demand for such media development is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Ordinarily, the density of optical recording media can be increased by shortening the wavelength of the laser used for recording and playback, and by reducing beam spots through increasing NA (numerical aperture) of objective lenses. Recently, from red semiconductor lasers having a wavelength of 680 nm, 650 nm or 635 nm, to bluish purple semiconductor lasers (may be referred below as &ldquo;bluish purple laser&rdquo;) that have a wavelength of 400 nm to 500 nm and are capable of super high-density recording, development has rapidly advanced. The development of optical recording media corresponding to these lasers is also being conducted. In particular, the development of optical recording systems using bluish purple lasers and high NA pickups has been explored since bluish purple lasers hit the market, and rewritable optical recording media and optical recording systems having phase change recording layers have already been announced as a DVR system (&ldquo;ISOM2000&rdquo;, pp. 210-211). Thus, some progress has been made with respect to increasing the density of rewritable optical recording media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In optical recording media for optical recording systems using bluish purple lasers and high NA pickups, it is preferable to reduce the thickness of the cover layer on which the laser is made incident in order to focus the high NA objective lens when the recording layer is irradiated with the bluish purple laser. For example, a thin film is used as the cover layer and adhered to the recording layer with an adhesive. The combined thickness of the cover layer and an adhesive layer formed by curing the adhesive is approximately 100 &mgr;m, and optimized in accordance with the wavelength of the laser used and NA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, in write-once optical recording media recorded and played back by optical recording systems using bluish purple lasers and high NA pickups, the use of an organic compound in the recording layer is problematic in that satisfactory recording characteristics are unobtainable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> While the cause of this problem is not entirely clear, it is assumed that fine unevenness occurs in the recording layer because the organic compound in the recording layer becomes dissolved into the adhesive of the adhesive layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing an exemplary embodiment of an optical recording medium <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally includes a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having successively disposed thereon a light-reflecting layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a recording layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a sputter layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. However, the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include other layers as needed. Information is recorded on or played back from the optical recording medium <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> conduct by irradiating the medium <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with a laser beam having a wavelength of 450 nm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Substrate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Examples of material constituting the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include glass, polycarbonates, acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride resins such as polyvinyl chloride and a vinyl chloride copolymer, epoxy resins, amorphous polyolefins and polyesters. These may be used either singly or in combination. A polycarbonate is preferable in view of resistance to moisture, dimensional stability and cost. The thickness of the substrate 10 is generally within a range from 0.4 to 1.5 mm and preferably within a range from 1.1 to 1.3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably includes a tracking groove or a pre-groove for information such as an address signal. The pre-groove is preferably directly formed in the substrate by injection-molding or extrusion-molding a resin material such as a polycarbonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The pre-groove may also be formed by disposing a pre-groove layer. Examples of materials usable for the pre-groove layer include a mixture of a photopolymerization initiator and at least one monomer (or oligomer) selected from a monoester, a diester, a triester and a tetraester of acrylic acid. The pre-groove layer can be formed by, for example, first coating a mixed solution of the acrylic ester and the polymerization initiator on a precisely made stamper, placing the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the coating solution layer, irradiating the coating solution layer with ultraviolet light through the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the stamper to thereby cure the coating solution layer and adhere the same to the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and thereafter separating the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the stamper. The thickness of the pre-groove layer is generally within a range from 0.01 to 100 &mgr;m, and preferably within a range from 0.05 to 50 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to use a substrate having formed therein a pre-groove of a track pitch that is narrower than the track pitch of a CD-R or DVD-R, in order to attain higher recording density. The track pitch of the pre-groove in the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is within a range from 100 to 600 nm. </paragraph>

Because the optical recording medium of the invention has high sensitivity, recording is possible even with low laser power, and there is an advantage in that a less expensive laser can be used or the use life of the laser can be prolonged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable to dispose an undercoat layer on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which the light reflection layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed, in order to improve flatness and increase adhesive strength. </paragraph>

Examples thereof include ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, butanediol diacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, butanediol dimethacrylate, hexanediol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate and tripropylene glycol dimethacrylate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, polyether acrylates and polyether methacrylates obtained by adding acrylic acid and methacrylic acid to polyether polyols such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and polytetramethylene glycol, and polyester acrylates and polyester methacrylates formed by adding acrylic acid and methacrylic acid to polyester polyols obtained from known dibasic acids and glycols can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Polyurethane acrylates and polyurethane methacrylates obtained by adding acrylic acid and methacrylic acid to polyurethanes resulting from a reaction of known polyols and diols with known polyisocyanates can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Bisphenol A, bisphenol F, hydrogenated bisphenol A, hydrogenated bisphenol F and alkylene oxide adducts thereof with acrylic acid and methacrylic acid added, compounds having a cyclic structure, such as an isocyanuric acid alkylene oxide-modified diacrylate, an isocyanuric acid alkylene oxide-modified dimethacrylate, a tricyclodecanedimethanol diacrylate and tricyclodecanedimethanol dimethacrylate can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although description has been given of radiation-curable resins, commercially available UV-curable resins (UV-curable adhesives) such as &ldquo;SD-640&rdquo; and &ldquo;SD-347&rdquo; (both are trade names: made by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Inc.) can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As the rays used to cure the radiation-curable resin, electron rays and ultraviolet rays may be preferably used. When using an ultraviolet ray, it becomes necessary to add a photopolymerization initiator to compounds described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An aromatic ketone can be used as the photopolymerization initiator. There are no particular limitations on the aromatic ketone. The aromatic ketone generates a line spectral of a mercury lamp ordinarily used as an ultraviolet irradiation light source. Those having a relatively large absorbency coefficient in wavelengths of 254 nm, 313 nm and 865 nm are preferable. Typical examples thereof include acetophenone, benzophenone, benzoin ethyl ether, benzyl methyl ketal, benzyl ethyl ketal, benzoin isobutyl ketone, hydroxydimethyl phenyl ketone, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, 2, 2-diethoxyacetophenone and Michler&apos;s ketone. Thus, various aromatic ketones can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The mixing ratio of the aromatic ketone is 0.5 to 20 parts by mass, preferably 2 to 15 parts by mass, more preferably 3 to 10 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the ultraviolet-curable resin. As the ultraviolet-curable adhesive, products already containing a photopolymerization initiator are commercially available and may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A mercury lamp is used as the ultraviolet light source. The mercury lamp uses a lamp of 20 to 200 W/cm at a rate of 0.3 m/min to 20 m/min. It is generally preferable for the distance between the substrate and the mercury lamp to be 1 to 30 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As an electron-ray accelerator, a scanning system, a double scanning system or a curtain beam system can be employed. A curtain beam system is preferable because large output can be obtained at a relatively low cost. Acceleration voltage of the electron rays is 100 to 1,000 kV, and preferably 150 to 300 kV, and an absorption dose of the electron rays is 0.5 to 20 Mrad, and preferably 1 to 10 Mrad. When the acceleration voltage is less than 10 kV, transmission of energy is insufficient. When the acceleration voltage exceeds 1,000 kV, the efficiency with which energy is used in polymerization becomes poor and uneconomical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Cover Layer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed on the sputter layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> using the adhesive (through the adhesive layer). Transmission of the laser beam used in recording and playback is preferably at least 80%, and more preferably at least 90%. Further, the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably a resin sheet having a surface roughness Ra of 5 nm or less. Examples of the resin sheet include a polycarbonate (for example, trade name: PURE ACE, made by Teijin Ltd., and trade name: PANLITE, made by Teijin Ltd.), cellulose triacetate (tradename: FUJI TAC, made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) and PET (trade name: LUMILAR, made by Toray Industries, Inc.). A polycarbonate and cellulose triacetate are preferable. The surface roughness Ra of the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is determined in accordance with factors such as the type of resin, method by which the film is formed, and the presence or absence of a filler. The surface roughness Ra of the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is measured by, for example, a HD 2000 (trade name, manufactured by WYKO). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is determined in accordance with NA and the wavelength of the laser beam used in recording and playback. The thickness is preferably within a range from 0.005 to 1 mm, and more preferably within a range from 0.01 to 0.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Other Layers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A protecting layer may be disposed on the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The protecting layer may be formed of, for example, an UV-curable resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The protecting layer can be formed by, for example, spin coating a UV-curable adhesive on the surface of the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and then irradiating the adhesive with ultraviolet light from a UV irradiation lamp to cure the UV-curable resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The surface roughness of the side of the optical recording medium 100 at which the laser is made incident is determined in accordance with factors such as the surface roughness of the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the surface roughness of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, conditions in which forming the light reflection layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed, the type of the recording layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, film-forming conditions, the type of the adhesive layer, coating conditions, and the type and the coating conditions of the protecting layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the optical recording medium 100 of the invention, the recording and the playback of an information are conducted as follows. The optical recording medium 100 is rotated at a predetermined linear velocity (0.5 to 10 m/sec) or a predetermined angular velocity and irradiated with a recording light such as a bluish purple laser (having, for example, a wavelength of 405 nm) from the side of the cover layer 50 through the objective lens 200. The recording layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> absorbs the light, whereby temperature increases locally. Consequently, pits are generated to change the optical characteristics, whereby information is recorded. The recorded information is played back by rotating the optical recording medium 100 at a predetermined linear velocity and irradiating the medium 100 with the bluish purple laser beam from the side of the cover layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, whereby reflected light is detected. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Production of Optical Recording Medium A substrate of polycarbonate resin (trade name: PANLITE AD5503, made by Teijin Ltd.) including a spiral groove (depth 100 nm, width 0.120 &mgr;m, track pitch 0.3 &mgr;m) and having a thickness of 1.1 mm and a diameter of 120 mm was obtained by injection molding. Ag was sputtered on the grooved surface of the resulting substrate to form a light-reflecting layer having a thickness of 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> 2 g of a phthalocyanine organic compound A (maximum absorption: 340 nm) was then mixed with 148 ml of 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropanol and dissolved by ultrasonic treatment for 2 hours to prepare a coating solution for forming a recording layer. The resulting coating solution was spin-coated on the light-reflecting layer at 23&deg; C. and 50% RH while changing the rotational speed from 300 to 4,000 rpm. Thereafter, the resulting product is allowed to dry for 2 hours at 23&deg; C. and 50% RH to form a recording layer (thickness: 100 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> ZnS&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was sputtered on the recording layer to a thickness of 20 nm to form a sputter layer. An UV-curable adhesive (trade name: SD-347, made by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Inc.; solubility in the organic compound being 0.05% by weight) was spin-coated on the sputter layer at 200 rpm. A polycarbonate sheet (trade name: PURE ACE, made by Teijin Ltd., Ra: 1 nm) was laid on the coated UV-curable adhesive layer, and the UV-curable adhesive was then spread over the entire surface of the recording layer while changing the rotational speed from 300 to 4,000 rpm. Subsequently, the adhesive was irradiated with ultraviolet light from an UV irradiation lamp to cure the UV-curable adhesive and form a cover layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Further, a UV-curable adhesive (tradename: SD-347, made by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Inc.) was spin-coated on the cover layer at 200 rpm, and the UV-curable adhesive was then spread over the entire surface of the cover layer while changing the rotational speed from 300 to 4,000 rpm. Subsequently, the adhesive was irradiated with ultraviolet light from an UV irradiation lamp to cure the UV-curable adhesive and form a protecting layer. In this manner, an optical recording medium of Example 1 was produced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As indicated by the results in Table 1, it was found that good recording characteristics and good jitter are achieved by disposing the sputter layer between the recording layer and the cover layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the thickness of the sputter layer is 80 nm or less, and preferably 50 nm or less, heat applied to and decomposing the recording layer is transferred to the cover layer, making it possible to expedite deformation of the cover layer. The deformation of the cover layer scatters the laser beam to increase a degree of modulation and improve C/N. Meanwhile, when the sputter layer is thick, as in Comparative Example 2, there are problems in that the heat is released from the sputter layer and the rigidity of the sputter layer itself is increased, which makes it difficult for the cover layer to be deformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the optical recording medium of the invention corresponding to the bluish purple laser and the high NA pickup, the sputter layer is formed between the recording layer and the cover layer, whereby unevenness in the recording layer, which adversely effects recording characteristics, can be prevented. Accordingly, the invention can provide a write-once optical recording medium having high density and excellent recording characteristics. </paragraph>
