<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a digital sound processing program executing apparatus, a digital sound processing program executing method, a recordable media, and a digital audio sound processing system, and more particularly to an apparatus for and a method of executing a digital sound processing program after producing the executable program of the digital sound processing program from a plurality of subprograms on the basis of a block diagram of the digital sound processing program displayed in a monitor screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such a digital sound processing program executing apparatus is, in general, available for producing an executable program of the digital sound processing program from an algorithm of the digital sound processing program without a sophisticated technical knowledge on the computer programming language to process the digital sound with various forms of the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Up until now, there have been proposed a wide variety of digital sound processing program executing apparatuses as will be seen for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,862,231. The conventional digital sound processing program executing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> disclosed by the above United States Patent is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The conventional digital sound processing program executing apparatus comprises subprogram storing means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for storing a plurality of subprograms, selecting means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for selecting the subprograms stored by the subprogram storing means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the basis of the digital sound processing program, displaying means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for displaying the subprograms to show a digital sound processing program in the form of graphic symbols, the subprograms including a preceding subprogram and a following subprogram to be performed after the preceding subprogram is to be performed, subprogram linking means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for linking the preceding subprogram and the following subprogram the basis of the digital signal processing program displayed on the displaying means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, executable program producing means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for producing an executable microprogram from the subprograms linked by the subprogram linking means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a digital sound processor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for processing a digital sound on the basis of the executable program, and transferring means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for transferring the executable program to the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The conventional digital sound processing program executing apparatus thus constructed in the above encounters such a problem that each of the digital sound processing programs requested by an operator obliges each of the subprograms to be performed in a reading stage to ensure that each of the following subprograms is performed to receive the digital sound data in the reading stage after the preceding subprogram is performed to discharge the digital sound data in the writing stage, so that each of the subprograms is required to be previously stored in the subprogram storing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another problem is that the subprograms stored by the subprogram storing means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> tend to require the subprogram storing means to increase the memory capacity, thereby forcing all of the subprograms to be prepared before producing each of the digital sound processing programs requested by an operator. </paragraph>

<claim id="CLM-00035">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. A digital audio sound processing system for processing a digital audio sound data in a plurality of processing stages to execute a digital sound processing program after producing said digital sound processing program from a plurality of subprograms, each of said subprograms being associated with an icon image, comprising: 
<claim-text>icon image displaying means for displaying said icon images indicative of said subprograms of said digital sound processing program, said icon image displaying means being constituted by a monitor screen, said subprograms including a preceding subprogram and a following subprogram to be performed after said preceding subprogram is to be performed, each of said preceding subprogram and said following subprogram being to be performed in a processing stage, said icon images including a first icon image indicative of said preceding subprogram and a second icon image indicative of said following subprogram, said subprograms further including a reading subprogram to be performed in a reading stage, each of said preceding subprogram and said following subprogram including at least one dividable subprogram to be performed in a processing state, said dividable subprogram including a preceding short-subprogram and a following short-subprogram to be performed after said preceding short-subprogram is to be performed, each of said preceding short-subprogram and said following short-subprogram being to be performed in a processing stage; </claim-text>
<claim-text>subprogram dividing means for dividing said dividable subprogram into said preceding short-subprogram and said following short-subprogram; </claim-text>
<claim-text>icon image connecting means for connecting said first icon image with said second icon image to allow said icon image displaying means to show said digital sound processing program; </claim-text>
<claim-text>subprogram storing means for storing said subprograms; </claim-text>
<claim-text>subprogram transferring means for transferring said subprograms out of said subprogram storing means; </claim-text>
<claim-text>dividable subprogram judging means for judging whether or not said dividable subprogram dividing means is operative to divide said dividable subprograms into said preceding short-subprogram and said following short-subprogram on the basis of said digital sound processing program displayed by said icon image displaying means; </claim-text>
<claim-text>subprogram linking means for linking said preceding short-subprogram with said following short-subprogram through said reading subprogram after said subprogram dividing means is operative to divide said dividable subprogram into said preceding short-subprogram with said following short-subprogram, and linking said preceding subprogram with said following subprogram on the basis of said digital sound processing program displayed by said icon image displaying means; </claim-text>
<claim-text>subprogram judging means for judging whether or not said subprogram linking means is operative to link said preceding subprogram with said following subprogram on the basis of said digital sound processing program displayed by said icon image displaying means; </claim-text>
<claim-text>executable program producing means for producing a targeted executable program from said subprograms linked by said subprogram linking means; </claim-text>
<claim-text>executable program storing means for storing said targeted executable program; </claim-text>
<claim-text>executable program transferring means for transferring said targeted executable program into said executable program storing means; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>executable program executing means for executing said targeted executable program stored by said executable program storing means.</claim-text>
