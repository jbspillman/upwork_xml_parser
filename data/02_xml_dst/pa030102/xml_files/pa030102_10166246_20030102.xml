<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a resin-sealed semiconductor device in which a die pad portion having a semiconductor element mounted thereon is exposed from a sealing resin, and a manufacturing method thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a resin-sealed semiconductor device preventing generation of resin voids within a sealing resin, and a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recent reduction in size of electronic equipments requires high-density packaging of semiconductor components such as a resin-sealed semiconductor device. In response to such a requirement, the semiconductor components are increasingly reduced in size and thickness. In addition to such a trend, semiconductor devices having an increased number of pins are increasingly produced. Accordingly, there is a demand for a small, thin, high-density resin-sealed semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device having a die pad portion exposed from a resin will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C show a conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> is a plan view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> is a bottom view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C, a semiconductor element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is mounted on a die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of a lead frame. The semiconductor element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by thin metal wires <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are sealed with a sealing resin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The side surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is flush with the terminal ends of the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is exposed from the sealing resin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The tips of the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are exposed as external terminals <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method for manufacturing the conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>D are cross-sectional views illustrating the steps of the method for manufacturing the conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device using a lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, a</cross-reference> lead frame is first prepared. The lead frame has a frame portion, a rectangular die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> provided within the frame portion, for mounting a semiconductor element thereon, suspended lead portions for supporting the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and beam-like inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to be electrically connected to the semiconductor element mounted on the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by connecting means such as thin metal wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B, a</cross-reference> semiconductor element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is then bonded to the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the lead frame by an adhesive such as silver paste (die bonding step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, electrode pads (not shown) on the surface of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> mounted on the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are respectively connected with the tips of the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the lead frame by thin metal wires <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (wire bonding step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>D, with a sealing sheet in close contact with the lead frame, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are sealed with a sealing resin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, the sealing step is conducted with the sealing sheet in close contact with the bottom surface of the lead frame. Therefore, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the suspended lead portions, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the connection regions of the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are sealed except the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the bottom surface of each inner lead portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. As a result, the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is exposed from the bottom surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device and the manufacturing method thereof, a semiconductor element is first mounted on a lead frame and electrical connection thereof is then conducted using thin metal wires. The subsequent resin sealing step is conducted with a sealing sheet in close contact with the bottom surface of the lead frame. In the resin sealing step, however, the air may be introduced into the interface between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion and the inner lead portions of the lead frame. In this case, this air is trapped at the interface without being forced to air vents formed in a mold. As a result, the air is trapped at the end of the die pad, whereby resin voids are generated in the sealing resin near the die pad portion. Recently, such a phenomenon often occurs in the resin sealing step using both a multi-pin, high-density lead frame having leads arranged at smaller intervals and a sealing sheet. This is extremely problematic in manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device having a die pad portion exposed from a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Resin voids thus produced in the sealing resin would generate cracks within the resin during operation in the heating environment, hindering mounting of the resin-sealed semiconductor device on a circuit board. This is not preferable in terms of reliability. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is made to solve the above conventional problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a resin-sealed semiconductor device having a die pad portion exposed from a sealing resin and a manufacturing method thereof, which prevent generation of resin voids within a sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a resin-sealed semiconductor device includes a die pad portion for mounting a semiconductor element thereon, a semiconductor element mounted on the die pad portion and having electrodes, a plurality of lead portions arranged with their respective tips facing the die pad portion, thin metal wires for connecting the electrodes of the semiconductor element to the lead portions, and a sealing resin for sealing the die pad portion, the semiconductor element, the lead portions and connection regions of the thin metal wires except a bottom surface of the die pad portion and respective bottom surfaces and terminal ends of the lead portions. The terminal ends of the lead portions are approximately flush with a side surface of the sealing resin. The die pad portion has a first recess formed in an outer periphery of the bottom surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the resin-sealed semiconductor device further includes suspended lead portions for supporting the die pad portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the die pad portion has an upward projecting support portion for supporting the semiconductor element. A second recess is provided at a region of the bottom surface of the die pad portion that corresponds to the support portion. The first recess formed at the bottom surface of the die pad portion is a groove-like recess extending from an outer end of the bottom surface of the die pad portion to the second recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least the lead portions include first lead portions arranged with their respective tips facing the die pad portion, and second lead portions extending so that their respective tips are located at a position closer to the die pad portion than are the tips of the first lead portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, respective bottom surfaces of the first lead portions and respective bottom surfaces of the second lead portions form land electrodes. The land electrodes are arranged in at least two rows in a bottom surface region of the sealing resin when viewed two-dimensionally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device includes the steps of: preparing a lead frame having a die pad portion provided within a frame portion formed from a metal plate, for mounting a semiconductor element thereon, a plurality of lead portions arranged with their respective tips facing the die pad portion and their respective terminal ends connected to the frame portion, and a sealing sheet attached in close contact with respective bottom surfaces of the lead portions and a bottom surface of the die pad portion, the die pad portion having a first recess formed in an outer periphery of the bottom surface thereof; mounting a semiconductor element having electrodes on the die pad portion of the prepared lead frame with a main surface of the semiconductor element facing upward; connecting the electrodes of the semiconductor element thus mounted on the die pad portion to the lead portions of the lead frame by thin metal wires; and sealing an upper side of the lead frame with a sealing resin so that the die pad portion, the semiconductor element, the lead portions and connection regions of the thin metal wires are sealed except the bottom surface of the die pad portion and the respective bottom surfaces of the lead portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Preferably, in the resin sealing step, air trapped between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion of the lead frame is released into the first recess formed at the bottom surface of the die pad portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, after the resin sealing step, the terminal ends of the lead portions are cut away so that the resultant terminal ends of the lead portions are approximately flush with a side surface of the sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device includes the steps of: preparing a lead frame having a die pad portion provided within a frame portion formed from a metal plate, for mounting a semiconductor element thereon, suspended lead portions supporting an outer periphery of the die pad portion with their respective tips and connected to the frame portion at their respective terminal ends, and a plurality of lead portions arranged with their respective tips facing the die pad portion and their respective terminal ends connected to the frame portion, the die pad portion having a first recess formed in an outer periphery of a bottom surface thereof; mounting a semiconductor element having electrodes on the die pad portion of the prepared lead frame with a main surface of the semiconductor element facing upward; connecting the electrodes of the semiconductor element thus mounted on the die pad portion to the lead portions of the lead frame by thin metal wires; and attaching a sealing sheet in close contact with at least respective bottom surfaces of the lead portions and the bottom surface of the die pad portion out of a bottom surface of the lead frame, and sealing an upper side of the lead frame with a sealing resin so that the die pad portion, the suspended lead portions, the semiconductor element, the lead portions and connection regions of the thin metal wires are sealed except the bottom surface of the die pad portion and the respective bottom surfaces of the lead portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably, after the resin sealing step, the respective terminal ends of the suspended lead portions and the lead portions are cut away so that the resultant terminal ends of the suspended lead portions and the lead portions are approximately flush with a side surface of the sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present invention, the die pad portion has a first recess formed in the outer periphery of the bottom surface thereof. This structure allows the air (air bubbles) trapped at the interface between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion in the resin sealing step to be released into the first recess or released through the first recess into the second recess formed at the bottom surface of the die pad portion. This prevents the air from remaining at the interface in the resin sealing step, thereby enabling implementation of a void-less resin-sealed semiconductor device. In particular, when the die pad portion has an upward projecting support portion, the air can be released into the second recess under the support portion. This prevents voids from remaining in the sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing method of the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present invention, the resin sealing step is conducted while allowing the air trapped between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion of the lead frame to be released into the first recess formed at the bottom surface of the die pad portion. Generation of resin voids is thus prevented.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> used in the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment has an approximately rectangular shape when viewed two-dimensionally. The die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an upward projecting support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>approximately in the center thereof in order to support a semiconductor element. The die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed from a metal plate, and the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by pressing the metal plate upward so that the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is half-cut from the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, a second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed under the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. V-grooves are formed in the outer periphery of the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as first recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The V-grooves extend from the four sides of the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (i.e., from the outer peripheral edge of the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to the second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>.

This structure thus prevents generation of voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the first recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that the air (air bubbles) trapped at the interface between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the resin sealing step can be released into the first recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This prevents the air from remaining at the interface in the resin sealing step, thereby enabling implementation of a void-less resin-sealed semiconductor device. In particular, the upward projecting support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> allows the trapped air to be released through the first recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>under the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> First, the lead frame used in the manufacturing method of the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The lead frame is formed from a metal plate of a copper material, 42-alloy or the like that is commonly used for lead frames. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the lead frame includes an approximately rectangular die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, first linear lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second linear lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which a semiconductor element is to be mounted. The first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have their respective tips facing the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and their respective terminal ends connected to a frame portion of the lead frame. The bottom surfaces of the tips of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>serve as external terminals (land portions). In addition to the bottom surface of the respective tips, the first lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can also be connected to a mount substrate at their respective outer side surfaces. In other words, the respective outer side surfaces of the first lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also serve as external terminals. A sealing sheet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is attached in close contact with the bottom surface of the lead frame. Note that the sealing sheet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in close contact with the respective bottom surfaces of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a circular support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>approximately in the center of the surface thereof. The die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed from a flat plate, and the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by pressing the flat plate so that the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is half-cut from the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thus projects upward from the remaining region of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, a second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed under the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>substantially serves to support the semiconductor element. Therefore, the semiconductor element is mounted on the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a gap between the surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> excluding the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the back surface of the semiconductor element. In the present embodiment, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed from a metal plate having a thickness of 200 &mgr;m (which is a lead frame thickness), and the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projects by 50 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m from the surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (i.e., 25% to 50% of the thickness of the metal plate). First recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (V-grooves) are formed by a half-etching process so as to extend from the four sides of the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the lead frame of the present embodiment are connected to the frame portion and alternately arranged in parallel. The first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged with their respective tips facing the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extend so that their tips are located at a position closer to the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> than are the tips of the first lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The respective tips of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are thus arranged in a staggered manner when viewed two-dimensionally. As a result, when the semiconductor element is mounted and resin-sealed, external terminals are arranged in two rows in a staggered manner at the bottom surface of the package, and the bottom surfaces of the tips of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are located at the bottom surface of the package. Each of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a linear lead having a land portion at the bottom surface of its tip. Each land portion has a curvature at its tip, and serves as an external terminal. Each of the second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a reduced thickness in the region other than the land portion by a half-etch process. The land portion has an original thickness of the second lead portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a process of manufacturing the resin-sealed semiconductor device using the above lead frame will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> lead frame is prepared. The lead frame has a die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provided within a frame portion formed from a metal plate, for mounting a semiconductor element thereon, and a plurality of first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The plurality of first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have their respective tips facing the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and their respective terminal ends connected to the frame portion. A sealing sheet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in close contact with the bottom surface of the lead frame. The die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has first recesses at its bottom surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> semiconductor element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then bonded to the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the lead frame with the main surface of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> facing upward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, electrodes of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> thus mounted on the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lead frame by thin metal wires <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, the upper side of the lead frame is sealed with a sealing resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the connection regions of the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are sealed except the bottom surface of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the respective bottom surfaces of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this sealing step, the air trapped between the sealing sheet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the lead frame is released through the first recesses (which extend from the four sides of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) into the second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>under the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This sealing step thus prevents generation of resin voids. A resin mold normally has air vents. In a semiconductor device having lead portions densely arranged at a small pitch as in the present embodiment, however, the resin sealing step is completed before the trapped air moves to the air vents of the mold. As a result, voids are generated in the resin. In the present embodiment, however, the die pad portion has the first recesses. The first recesses allow the air to be released into the second recess <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>under the support portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> even if it cannot move to the air vents of the mold. Generation of resin voids is thus prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, after the resin sealing step, the terminal ends of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are cut away so that the resultant terminal ends of the first and second lead portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are approximately flush with the side surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this way, the resin-sealed semiconductor device having the same structure as that described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is obtained. The resin-sealed semiconductor device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a reliable resin-sealed semiconductor device having no resin void generated near the die pad portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the resin-sealed semiconductor device and the manufacturing method thereof according to the present embodiment, the die pad portion of the lead frame has first recesses, and the air trapped at the interface between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion in the resin sealing step can be released into the first recesses. This prevents the air from remaining at the interface in the resin sealing step and enables implementation of a void-less resin-sealed semiconductor device. Especially, since the die pad portion has an upward projecting support portion, the air can be released through the first recesses into the second recess under the support portion. This prevents voids from remaining in the sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Note that a resin-sealed semiconductor device having lead portions arranged in two rows is described in the present embodiment. However, the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present invention may alternatively have the lead portions arranged in a row or in three or more rows. The present invention is widely applicable to a manufacturing method of a resin-sealed semiconductor device having only one side sealed with a resin and having a die pad portion exposed from the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The sealing resin may either be present or may not be present in the second recess of the die pad portion. This is because resin voids in the second recess have no influence on mounting of the resin-sealed semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The first recesses are not limited to V-grooves. The first recesses may have any shape as long as they are formed at the bottom surface of the die pad portion. For example, the first recesses may be U-grooves (troughs), grooves having their respective sidewalls extending perpendicularly to the bottom surface of the die pad portion and their respective bottoms extending in parallel with the bottom surface of the die pad portion, grooves having their respective sidewalls tilted as in V-grooves and their respective bottoms extending in parallel with the bottom surface of the die pad portion, or undercut slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A plurality of lead frames of the present embodiment may be resin-sealed at a time. In this case, the resin sealing step is conducted with the plurality of lead frames arranged adjacent to each other on a flat surface. Such a resin sealing method is called &ldquo;map molding&rdquo;. In this method, the air is likely to remain in the sealing resin. Therefore, it is preferable to use the lead frame and the manufacturing method of the present embodiment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the resin-sealed semiconductor device and the manufacturing method thereof according to the present embodiment, the die pad portion of the lead frame has first recesses, and the air trapped at the interface between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion in the resin sealing step can be released into the first recesses. This prevents the air from remaining at the interface in the resin sealing step and enables implementation of a void-less resin-sealed semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Note that a resin-sealed semiconductor device having lead portions arranged in two rows is described in the present embodiment. However, the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present invention may alternatively have the lead portions arranged in a row or in three or more rows. The present invention is widely applicable to a manufacturing method of a resin-sealed semiconductor device having only one side sealed with a resin and having a die pad portion exposed from the resin. A map molding method may be used as a resin sealing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As has been described above, the present invention enables implementation of a resin-sealed semiconductor device having no void generated in a sealing resin near the die pad portion. This especially applies to a resin-sealed semiconductor device having a die pad portion exposed from a sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention allows the air trapped between the sealing sheet and the die pad portion of the lead frame to be released into the first recesses of the die pad portion in the resin sealing step, whereby generation of voids is prevented. Therefore, the manufacturing method of the resin-sealed semiconductor device according to the present invention is an excellent manufacturing method that is widely applicable to a manufacturing method of a resin-sealed semiconductor device having only one side sealed with a resin and having a die pad portion exposed from the resin. </paragraph>
