<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for recording in at least two planes radiation from a radiotherapy apparatus in a limited area at which the radiation is directed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In particular, the invention relates to a device for determining the resulting radiation, which from a number of different directions hits a plane or a volume, by recording the radiation on media sensitive to radiation, such as films, semiconductors, ionization chambers, etc., in defined positions and simultaneously or later evaluating recorded radiation data with respect to the distribution of the radiation in time and space by means of a read-out device. The device is especially suited for accurate spatial determination relative to given references of geometrically defined radiation distributions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The device is also suited for quality assurance of a whole precision radiation procedure by allowing target volumes to be simulated, which volumes can be determined as regards shape and position by medical, image-creating equipment, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computer tomography, etc., for planning treatment of precision radiation and for verifying radiation based on planning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the device is above all intended to be used together with ELEKTA AB&apos;s gamma knife which is presented in the leaflet &ldquo;Leksell Gamma Knife, Model C, System Description with Technical Overview&rdquo;, cf. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,780,898 and 5,528,651. Here Leksell Gamma Plane is advantageously used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,107 discloses what is referred to as a phantom assembly for measuring radiation dose distributions in order to verify the radiation dose applied in a target area. The phantom assembly is constructed of material that is the radiological equivalent of the part of a patient&apos;s body that is to be treated, in the presented embodiment the patient&apos;s skull. A radiation sensitive film is inserted into a slit in the phantom assembly, a treatment dose is applied to the phantom and the film is analyzed with respect to the radiation exposure. In one embodiment of the phantom, three films have been inserted into one another in three mutually orthogonal planes (in the X, Y and Z directions) and then eight partial cubes have been applied around the films, one in each quadrant, so that a large cube which encloses the films is formed. The partial cubes are kept together by an enclosing casing. The partial cubes are to a certain extent movable in relation to one another, thereby affecting the precision in the positioning of the films and thus the determination of the target area. In addition, the radiation dose cannot be measured in the center of the phantom (the area with the common intersection point of the films (origin)), the center usually being the most interesting area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The international patent application PCT/CA99/01070 (WO 00/29871) discloses a phantom with films for stereo-tactic dosemetry. The phantom contains a cassettebox with a plurality of films which are positioned parallel to one another and are separated by distance means of a material which in terms of radiation is similar to the part of the patient&apos;s body that is to be treated. The phantom is rotatable about an axis to which all films are parallel. Thus, the plane of the films cannot be made to assume different angles relative to the attachment of the phantom so that a defined center plane of the phantom moves around a fixed center point in the phantom between a position parallel to the attachment and a position perpendicular to the attachment, which is necessary to be able to accurately determine the radiation in a three-dimensional area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to provide a device by means of which the common point (iso center) at which the radiation is directed from different directions, is determined with high geometric precision in connection with radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a device by means of which the geometrical radiation dose distribution in a radiotherapy apparatus can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the invention is to provide a device by means of which the total radiation dose can be measured during a simulated treatment process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, these objects are achieved by means of a device as stated by way of introduction, which is characterized in that the device comprises a dimensionally stable frame which is adapted to be arranged in a defined position relative to said radiation sources, an attachment on the frame for a recording means, and a recording means which extends from the attachment at an acute angle to the frame along an axis of rotation and to the center of the frame and which is adapted to assume at least two defined rotational positions on said axis, that the recording means exhibits a surface for supporting a radiation recording unit, which surface is located in a plane that forms an acute angle with said axis of rotation, and that the plane of the surface when rotating the recording means is adapted to turn on a single pivot point which is fixed relative to the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further developments of the invention are evident from the features stated in the subclaims.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference first to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which schematically illustrate the invention, the device according to the invention comprises a dimensionally stable frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with mounting elements in order to detachably mount the device by means of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a medical radiation machine or a radiotherapy apparatus, such as a gamma knife, an apparatus for computer or magnetic tomography, or the like. However, the device will be presented in connection with a gamma knife and, in particular, ELEKTA AD&apos;s gamma knife, U.S. Pat. No. 4,780,898, and the associated APS system, U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,651, which are herewith incorporated by reference. The illustrated frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thus comprises mounting elements in the form of a pair of through holes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are centered relative to one another for mounting the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a laser knife in the same way as the frame (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is mounted in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,651 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>). The frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also comprises a recess <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for positioning the frame in said APS system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is preferably formed in one piece with the frame. A recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is movably supported on the attachment and is rotatably arranged on an axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which will be explained in more detail below. The axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extends at an acute angle, preferably 45&deg;, to the plane of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and through a pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> approximately in the middle of the frame and in a plane a having said mounting holes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> but at a distance therefrom. The plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to the plane of the frame, cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the shown embodiments of the device according to the invention (but not in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the form of a so-called spherical phantom. A phantom is the name of a dummy which replaces a real head (including bones and brain tissue) in connection with check and reference measurements of radiation focus position, extension and intensity. The obtained measuring data is then used when calculating patient doses, where (also) the patient&apos;s head is defined as a spherically shaped water volume (body) with a diameter of 160 mm. A certain degree of compensation for patient specific deviations in size from anatomic or data diagnostic examinations (geometries) may be carried out by software. In the practical routine work, instead of a water phantom, a ditto homogeneous, spherical plastic ball is used, having a density near water. It is often made divisible so that measurements can be carried out in planes near focus. The recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> thus consists of two hemispheres, one of which is filled with parallel lines and the other empty in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The parting plane of the sphere or the boundary surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the hemispheres runs/run through the center of the sphere and the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> cuts the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at a point which coincides with the above-mentioned pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The angle between the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is acute and, preferably, 45&deg;. The two hemispheres are kept together by clamping means, for example, by bolted joints <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) which extend in associated, through holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the two hemispheres at a large distance from the pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is arranged at and along the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, resting against a support surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a recess in one or both hemispheres, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. For reasons of clarity, the unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not shown in the other Figures except for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> in which the unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not placed in a recess for reasons which are made evident in the description of this embodiment of the device. The radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is in the shown embodiments a radiation sensitive film but can, if desirable, be a ionization chamber, a semiconductor detector, a dosimeter or the like, which all are well known to those skilled in the art. Said film is blackened to various degrees depending on how much radiation it has been exposed to, and by means of a scanning device which is connected to a computer (not shown), the radiation doses can at each point of the film be calculated; this too is prior-art technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The radiation recording unit or the film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is positioned in said recess by means of a pair of pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which extend through the recess and perpendicular to the parting plane, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, and which have different dimensions and are arranged at different distances from said pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Corresponding holes are punched in the film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (not shown but easily understood by those skilled in the art) and owing to the different dimensions and the location of the holes the exposed film cannot be incorrectly positioned in the above-mentioned scanning device. In some known, similar devices, an orientation pin is instead placed in the center of the phantom, which may damage the center area that in most cases is the most interesting measurement area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to be able to determine with high precision said radiation focus position, the geometrical dose distribution and/or the dose distribution in time (power) or the total dose, the recording means is also rotatably arranged on the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so that the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (and thus the unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) can assume at least two different angular positions relative to the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and in each angular position, the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> runs through the pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> thus carries out a controlled wobbling/pivoting motion along a closed path in three dimensions and with a center of the motion in the pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> Preferably, the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> assumes a position in a first rotational position of the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is perpendicular to the position of the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in a second rotational position of the recording means on the axis of rotation, cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. It is also preferred, but not necessary, that the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in one position be parallel to the plane of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in another position is perpendicular to the plane of the frame. By means of the device according to the invention, it is thus very simple to position with high precision the radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in different angular positions on a fixed pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been exposed to radiation in one position, for example according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the unit is removed by the hemispheres being separated and a new unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; being mounted. Subsequently, the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotated so that the unit can be exposed in another position, for example according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and then also the second unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; is removed. With the above-mentioned angle between the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the plane of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i.e. 45&deg;, and the indicated angle between the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, i.e. 45&deg;, the rotation of the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in this case thus becomes 180&deg;. By means of the units <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;, the above-mentioned determinations or measurements are then carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By means of a conventional radiation recording device, the measurement takes place in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> First the phantom is disassembled, the film placed between the hemispheres and the phantom reassembled. The phantom is then accurately oriented in the patient frame and is fastened. The patient frame is then attached in the machine and the film is exposed to rays for a first measurement. Then the patient frame is removed from the machine, the phantom is detached and the film is changed. The phantom then has to be accurately oriented again and be attached to the patient frame with the film plane preferably rotated through 90&deg; to the plane of the film in the first measurement. The patient frame is attached in the machine and a second measurement is carried out. Finally, the patient frame is removed from the machine, the film is developed and the dose distribution is calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As medical radiation equipment is developed to be controlled more precisely, correspondingly higher demands are placed on the equipment for calibration and verification measurements. One problem of the prior-art measuring equipment is to fulfill such higher demands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> One source of failure is that the center of the phantom must have exactly the same position on the two radiation occasions. It is also important that the angle between the plane of the film in the first position and that in the second position can be determined very accurately, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As the essential structure and function of the device according to the invention have been described above, reference is now made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for describing different embodiments of the same, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Reference is first made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, which show a first preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention. The recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> exhibits a surface portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and which preferably is in sliding engagement with a supporting surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> facing away from the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and facing the pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and also being oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which extends along the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to the recording means (phantom) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is rotatably mounted in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> being rotatable on the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In order to define two or more rotational positions of the means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and thus of the radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a locking means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is arranged in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The locking means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be made to protrude from the supporting surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for locking engagement with two or more associated cavities <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the surface portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, i.e. a cavity <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for each rotational position The locking means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shown as a spring-loaded body but can be a bolt, a cotter pin or the like, which per se is previously known. In addition, these Figures show the above-mentioned clamping means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the positioning pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for the radiation recording unit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also shows that the phantom <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be divisible into more than two portions. There are therefore one, two or more parting planes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&Prime; which are parallel to the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and in which further radiation recording units (not shown) can be mounted in the same manner as described above in connection with the unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and by means of the same through pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show an alternative construction of the above-mentioned preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention. They also illustrate that the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be arranged in a corner of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> instead of in a position between two corners of the frame as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the surface portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is supported by and by bolts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attached to a disc-shaped element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and which preferably is formed in one piece with the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shaft unit is rotatably mounted in a sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is fixedly attached to the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the center axis of which coincides with said axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the invention, at least one through hole or bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is drilled in the sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and in the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> essentially transversely to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The through bores <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are centered on a common center axis, along which a locking means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be inserted for locking engagement between the sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, which defines two rotational positions of the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and, thus, of the phantom <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are separated by 180&deg;. As discussed above, these rotational positions result in two different orientations of the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and, thus, of the radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which are perpendicular to one another if the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged at 45&deg; to the plane of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Naturally, the sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also be provided with more than one pair of co-operating bores <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in order to provide more possibilities of orientation for the unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, in which case they are displaced relative to one another in the direction of the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a variant of the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, which is especially adapted to calibration of a radiotherapy apparatus. What distinguishes these embodiments from one another is above all that the phantom <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in this embodiment has been replaced with a supporting plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the upper surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of which, i.e. its surface facing away from the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is adapted to support a radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is positioned at and along said (virtual) parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The supporting plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to, or preferably formed in one piece with, the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the above-discussed embodiments of the invention, the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotatable on the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between at least two fixed angular positions relative to the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which angular positions are determined by the locking means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in co-operation with the cavity <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, respectively. However, an automatic, two-dimensional radiation measuring can also be made in all planes in the target area about the pivot point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by making the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rotate, for example by means of a motor which is attached to the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and which in a per se known manner drives the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (not shown) The shaft unit is thus rotatably mounted directly in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 10</cross-reference>) or, preferably, indirectly in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by being supported in the sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). The radiation measuring is based on the fact that the angle of rotation of the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is always known and the radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a continuously recording detector which is preferably positioned as the unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> further embodiment is shown. In this embodiment, a cone-shaped connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is with its base <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> fixedly attached to the surface portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> presented above is fixedly attached to the connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and/or the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is rotatably mounted in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The attachment in this embodiment does not protrude from the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as in the embodiments mentioned above, but is countersunk in a portion of the frame having a contact surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which as regards its shape corresponds to the circumferential area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for sliding engagement between these two, With the aid of a locking means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which co-operates with cavities <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (only schematically indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) in the same manner as in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and thus the radiation recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, can be set in the positions discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> refers to a common stereotactic frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; as the frame shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,344 which is incorporated herewith by reference. The frame (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is along at least two sides (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) formed with dovetail-shaped guide means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and along one of these, the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is displaceably supported by an arm <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> extending towards the inside of the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. The arm <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be fixed in position on the guide means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is by means of a shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the free end of the arm <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is positioned in the same manner as in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotatably arranged on the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by means of a shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is rotatably mounted in the attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, the recording means or the phantom <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can also be rotated between fixed positions on the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> without any help from a shaft unit. One example of this is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with its base <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to the surface portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in this case essentially wedge-shaped and has two supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; protruding from the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which are symmetrically arranged relative to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and are arranged at right angles to one another as is evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Moreover, the supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; each has one threaded hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. As in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an attachment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is countersunk in a portion of the frame having a plane contact surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a through bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for a mounting bolt <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In order to set the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and thus the recording unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, in one position, for example parallel to the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, one supporting surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the connecting means is made to abut against the contact surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the attachment and the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fixed in this position by means of the bolt <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which via the bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is screwed into the threaded hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. When it is desirable to rotate the parting plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through 90&deg;, i.e. in this example perpendicular to the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the bolt <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is unscrewed from the hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotated freely (completely released from the attachment and the frame), after which the second support surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; of the connecting means is screwed onto the contact surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the attachment in the manner indicated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the last-mentioned embodiment of the device according to the invention, the connecting means has been described comprising two symmetrically arranged supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;. As is easily understood, the connecting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can, however, have three or more supporting surfaces, preferably symmetrically arranged with respect to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the bolt <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can be placed at an acute angle to the frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> instead of perpendicular to the frame, i.e. in the longitudinal direction of the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in which case the bolt need not be completely unscrewed from the recording means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> when changing its rotational position, cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, where the shaft unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be replaced with the bolt <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In connection with the drawings, different features of the device according to the invention have been presented. Naturally, the features shown in the Figures may be combined/replaced one with the other, if desirable. The attachment can also be arranged in an optional position on the frame on condition that the pivot point is fixed relative to the frame, i,e. that it does not change its position when the parting plane is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited to that described above and shown in the drawings and can be changed within the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
