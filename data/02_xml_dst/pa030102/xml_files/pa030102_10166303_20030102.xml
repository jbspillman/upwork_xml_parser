<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing semiconductor devices and a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus. More particularly, the invention relates to a manufacturing method of semiconductor devices and a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus which reduce the effect of particles (foreign matter particles) produced upon processing when manufacturing semiconductor devices by applying a plurality of steps of processing by means of plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When manufacturing semiconductor devices typically represented by an LSI (large-scale integrated circuit) such as a microprocessor or a memory, it is necessary to conduct a plurality of processing steps including a step of forming thin films comprising various insulating films and a conductive film on a semiconductor substrate and a step of processing the thus formed thin films or the semiconductor substrate itself. When performing these processing steps, it is the present practice to use a plurality of semiconductor manufacturing apparatuses including a plasma etcher, a plasma CVD (chemical vapor deposition) apparatus and a plasma sputtering apparatus using the plasma technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the step of processing a thin film formed on the semiconductor substrate into a desired shape, for example, the semiconductor substrate is transferred into a process chamber of a plasma etcher in such a state that a necessary area of the thin film is masked by a resist film for conducting plasma etching. A lower electrode which mounts the semiconductor substrate and an upper electrode arranged oppositely thereto are provided in the process chamber, and an etching gas is introduced into the process chamber. The etching gas is converted into plasma through generation of discharge in the process chamber by impressing a radio-frequency voltage onto the lower electrode to etch the portion not masked by a resist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, impression of radio-frequency power having a power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is started at time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After keeping power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a certain period of time, impression of radio-frequency power is discontinued at time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The extent of generation of plasma is governed substantially by the radio-frequency power. In order to actually generate plasma, other conditions such as the amount of introduced plasma generating gas, the inner pressure in the process chamber and the like may also be taken into account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When plasma-etching the thin film by use of the plasma etcher as described above, reaction products and the like are deposited in the process chamber. These deposits peel off, and adhere to the semiconductor substrate as particles, thereby contaminating the substrate. These stripped particles are produced similarly when applying processing by use of any of various plasma generators. For example, particles are produced as upon etching also when applying a plasma CVD processing by transferring the semiconductor substrate into the plasma CVD apparatus or when applying plasma sputtering by transferring the semiconductor substrate into a plasma sputtering apparatus. In these processing steps, each time the semiconductor. substrate is transferred to each plasma generator, processing the details of which are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is repeated. This causes a further increase in the number of produced particles. Therefore, when manufacturing semiconductor devices through repetition of various steps of processing yield decreases under the effect of particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When manufacturing semiconductor devices through a plurality of processing steps by use of plasma, therefore, it is conventionally conceived to accomplish manufacture through a plurality of successive steps while holding semiconductor substrates in process chambers of a common plasma generator, by switching over the extent of radio-frequency power from time to time in response to the individual processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in such a manufacturing method of semiconductor devices, a plurality of processes are carried out through a plurality of successive steps of conducting a process A by impressing a radio-frequency power of a power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> onto the lower electrode during the period from time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; conducting a process B by impressing a radio-frequency power of a power P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the period from time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; conducting a process C by impressing a radio-frequency power of a power P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during the period from time t<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; and conducting a process D by impressing a radio-frequency power of a power P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during the period from time t<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the existing manufacturing method of semiconductor devices, when conducting the method through a plurality of processes by means of plasma in a plurality of successive steps, a radio-frequency power is repeatedly started up and impressed for each step. This poses a problem of difficulty to reduce the effect of particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the existing manufacturing method of semiconductor devices, when conducting the plurality of processes through a plurality of successive steps, the radio-frequency power is repeatedly turned on and off for each of the steps. This results in stoppage of discharging each time. Because particles stripped off from the component parts of the process chamber are positively charged, the particles are confined in a sheath near the upper electrode or near the process chamber during plasma discharge. Upon stoppage of discharge and disappearance of plasma, the particles are attracted by the substrate having a negative self-bias potential, and adhere thereto. The particles dropping on the substrate during an interval between two steps may form defects through the next step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Repetition of a steep change in radio-frequency power from 0 to a high power or from a high power to 0 for every step causes application of stress onto the film of reaction products adhering in the process chamber, and breakage and stripping of this film causes easier production of particles. Particularly, particles produced in the proximity of the semiconductor substrate are attracted by the negative self-bias potential of the semiconductor substrate even during discharge, and adhere thereto. The particles adhered to the semiconductor substrate in the middle of a step may form defects during the current or next step processing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the particle monitoring system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a configuration, in which the behavior of particles is observed by the laser beam scattering method by irradiating a laser beam to a process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a plasma etcher (semiconductor manufacturing apparatus) <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> having the process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for applying an etching treatment to the semiconductor substrate, and a transfer chamber <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for transferring the semiconductor substrate into the process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The particle monitoring system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a laser source <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, an optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which irradiates a laser beam from the laser source <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a CCD camera <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which picks up an image of the interior of the process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus (a plasma etcher in this example) control panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which sets various observing conditions, a signal processor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which processes various signals from the semiconductor manufacturing apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which controls the entire system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, various signals from among parameters such as radio-frequency power (RF power) for processing, chamber inner pressure (Pressure), processing gas (for example, sulfur hexafluoride (SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) flow rate (Flow Rate), opening of a gate valve for transferring the semiconductor substrate (Insulation Valve), helium gas flow rate (He Flow Rate), electrostatic chucking voltage (ESC Voltage), electrostatic chucking current (ESC Current), and stage-up-position (Stage Up) are entered into the computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via the signal processor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The number of particles in the process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is measured by detecting the laser beam scattered in the process chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the CCD camera <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the mark &Circlesolid; represent a particle produced in the process chamber upon etching. Many particles are produced at a point in time of impressing a radio-frequency power and immediately after starting (25-40 seconds thereafter). Many particles are produced also immediately after discontinuing impression of radio-frequency current and discontinuing etching (103 to 105 seconds thereafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Particles produced as if they jumped up from the periphery of the semiconductor sub-strate (wafer) are observed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. These particles are conjectured to be produced through peeling of a thin film comprising an insulating film or a conductive film accumulating on component parts in the chamber to which stress is applied. As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the particles produced on the periphery of the semiconductor substrate were confirmed to come flying onto the semiconductor substrate describing a parabola and adhere thereto. This motion of the particles is attributable to the action of electrostatic force. This will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus using plasma, it is the common practice to adopt a configuration in which a grounded upper electrode is used as an anode and the lower electrode onto which radio-frequency voltage is impressed serves as a cathode. Ceramic rings which are insulators are arranged around the semiconductor substrate so that production of plasma is limited within the upper portion of the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the grounded upper electrode <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has a potential of 0, and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to which the radio-frequency power source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a negative potential. Plasma is generated in a space between the upper electrode <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and this plasma region shows a positive potential. In a typical semiconductor manufacturing apparatus, sheath areas in which potential steeply changes exist near the upper electrode <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While processing of the semiconductor substrate is repeated by use of the above-mentioned semiconductor manufacturing apparatus, reaction products are accumulated or deposited on the ceramic ring such that a thin film is formed. A force known as Maxell&apos;s stress is known to act on a dielectric present in an electrostatic field. When starting plasma discharge, the accumulated thin film of reaction products is placed in the electric field as described above, and Maxell&apos;s stress acts thereon under the effect of the dielectric constant or elastic modulus or a difference therebetween of the ceramic ring which is a dielectric. The thin film is broken and peels off, thus generating particles. The thus produced particles are positively charged as a result of collision of positive ions while the particles pass through the cathode sheath near the lower electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> On the surface of the semiconductor substrate, on the other hand, a negative self-bias potential spontaneously occurs as a result of a difference in mobility between electron and positive ion upon impressing the radio-frequency power. The particles positively charged in the cathode sheath are attracted by the semiconductor substrate having a negative self-bias potential under the effect of electrostatic force. This is considered to cause the motion of particles flying describing a parabola as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, it is confirmed that the particles having peeled off from the upper electrode are positively charged in the anode sheath, repelled by the bulk plasma, drop outside the plasma, and are attracted by the semiconductor substrate having a negative self-bias potential under the effect of action of the electrostatic force, at the moment when the plasma disappears along with discontinuance of processing.</paragraph>

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used for the implementation of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment comprises an introducing port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a plasma etching gas provided in the upper portion; a process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a gas outlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided in the lower portion and a gate valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided on a side for passing the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is to be processed; a cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, provided in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for mounting the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via a stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an anode arranged oppositely to the cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>; a shower head <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for guiding the gas to the cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>; an electrostatic chucking power source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> connected to the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; a radio-frequency source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected to the cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>; and radio-frequency power control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for controlling radio-frequency power output from the radio-frequency source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to become a desired power. The anode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is grounded. Aluminum (Al) excellent in heat conductivity and not discharging a detrimental substances such as a heavy metal is used for the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment will now be described in the sequence of steps with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This embodiment will be described by means of a case of manufacturing a middle structure of wiring of a DRAM (dynamic random access memory). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, a</cross-reference> semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided, having an insulating film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprising a silicon oxide film, a first metal film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprising a titanium (Ti) film, a second metal film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprising a titanium nitride (TiN) film, a third metal film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprising tungsten, and a second insulating film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprising a silicon oxide film, sequentially formed thereon. The first and second metal films <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are used for forming a barrier film, and the third metal film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> serves to form a bear plug. Then, a photoresist film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed in an area not subjected to processing on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is placed on the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is attracted by the electrostatic adsorption source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the radio-frequency power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by the radio-frequency power control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to set a first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A for carrying out a first processing during a period from time t to time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For this first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A, for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of from 780 to 820 W, and a time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of from 55 to 65 seconds. Simultaneously with this, an etching gas such as N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is introduced through the introducing port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58, a</cross-reference> second insulating film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is selectively etched with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as a mask, as a first processing in a first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the radio-frequency power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by the radio-frequency power control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to set a second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B for carrying out a second processing during a period from time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For this second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B. for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of from 580 to 620 W. and a time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of from 18 to 22 seconds are set. Simultaneously with this, an etching gas such as a mixed gas of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is introduced through the introducing port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C, a</cross-reference> third metal film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is selectively etched with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as a common mask, as a second processing in a second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B. Because transfer from the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A to the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B is continuously performed, the radio-frequency power never becomes 0 in steps in the middle, the extent of dropping of the particles in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes very slight, as is known from the result of observation described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, Since the change in the radio-frequency power becomes smaller in the interval between the first and second steps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B, production of particles is also inhibited, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the radio-frequency power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by the radio-frequency power control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to set a third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C for carrying out a third processing during a period from time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For this third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C, for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of from 640 to 660 W, and a time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of from 28 to 32 seconds are set. Simultaneously with this, an etching gas such as a mixed gas of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is introduced through the introducing port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> second metal film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is selectively etched with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as a common mask, as a third processing in a third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C. Because transfer from the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B to the third step is <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C continuously performed, the positively charged particles drop so as to avoid the positive plasma potential, and the extent of dropping of the particles in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes very slight, as is known from the result of observation described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Since the change in the radio-frequency power becomes smaller in the interval between the second and third steps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C, production of particles is also inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the radio-frequency power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by the radio-frequency power control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to set a fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D for carrying out a fourth processing during a period of from t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For this fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D, for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of from 390 to 410 W, and a time T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of from 28 to 32 seconds are set. Simultaneously with this, an etching gas such as N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is introduced through the introducing port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> first metal film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is selectively etched with the photoresist film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as a common mask, as a fourth processing in a fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A middle structure of DRAM wiring is manufactured through steps described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Because transfer from the third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C to the fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D is continuously performed, the positively charged particles drop so as to avoid the positive plasma potential, and the extent of dropping of the particles in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes very slight, as is known from the result of observation described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Since the change in the radio-frequency power becomes smaller in the interval between the third and fourth steps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D, production of particles is also inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> When conducting etching by use of the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> made of Al as described above, use of an etching gas containing fluoride (F) such as (CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) or (SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) is not desirable since it leads to easier formation of aluminum fluoride particles from a reaction between F and Al and resultant increase of particles present in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is therefore desirable to use an etching gas other than fluoride as is used in each processing in this embodiment. Applicable etching gases, other than nitrogen and oxygen shown above, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon and other inert elements, which bring about substantially the same advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, as described above, when applying the first to fourth processes while holding the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the first to fourth processes are carried out through the first to fourth steps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D in succession by switching over the level of radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in response to the individual processes. The plasma potential therefore never becomes 0 as a result of the radio-frequency power not becoming 0 in a step in the middle. The positively charged particles drop so as to avoid the positive plasma potential, so that the extent of dropping of the particles in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes very slight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When carrying out a plurality of processes by use of plasma through a plurality of successive steps, therefore, it is possible to inhibit occurrence of particles adhering to the semiconductor substrate and inhibit the number of particles, if produced, adhering to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of a second embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates changes with time in radio-frequency power in a case where a plurality of processes are carried out through a plurality of successive steps by means of the plasma etcher in the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices, which is the second embodiment of the invention. The configuration of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices in this embodiment is largely different from the configuration of the above-mentioned manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of the first embodiment in that an auxiliary step having an intermediate value of power between two adjacent steps is inserted between the two adjacent steps from among the plurality of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in the first to fourth steps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D corresponding to the first to fourth processes, a first auxiliary step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A having an intermediate value of power PS between power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and power P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B is inserted between the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B which adjacent to each other. A second auxiliary step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B having an intermediate value of power P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between power P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B and power P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C is inserted between the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B and the third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C which are adjacent to each other. A third auxiliary step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C having an intermediate value of power P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between power P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C and power P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D is inserted between the third step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C and the fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D which are adjacent to each other. For the first auxiliary step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of from 680 to 720 W and a time T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of from 1 to 5 seconds are set. For the second auxiliary step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of from 620 to 630 W and a time T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of from 1 to 5 seconds are set. For the third auxiliary step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>G, for example, a radio-frequency power P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of from 500 to 550 W and a time T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of from 1 to 5 seconds are set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the auxiliary steps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C having an intermediate value of radio-frequency power between the individual adjacent steps are inserted between the adjacent steps. Transfer between the steps can therefore be accomplished very accurately and continuously via the auxiliary steps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. This prevents loss of the balance between forces acting on the particles caused by a steep change in plasma potential, and thus, the extent of dropping of the particles in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes smaller than in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as well, there are available substantially the same advantages as those described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>

The configuration of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment is largely different from the above-mentioned configuration of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of the first embodiment in that an auxiliary step in which the level of power slowly changes between levels of power of two adjacent steps is inserted between the two adjacent steps from among the plurality of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in the first to fourth steps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D corresponding to the first to fourth processes, a first auxiliary step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A in which the level of power slowly changes between power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and power P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B is inserted between the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and the second step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B which are adjacent to each other.

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, auxiliary steps <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C in which the level of power slowly changes between the radio-frequency power values of the individual steps are inserted between two adjacent steps, respectively. Transfer between the steps can therefore be accomplished very accurately and continuously via the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of a fourth embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates changes with time in radio-frequency power in a case where a plurality of processes are carried out through a plurality of successive steps by means of the plasma etcher in the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices, which is a fourth embodiment of the invention. The configuration of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment is largely different from that of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of the first embodiment in that an auxiliary step in which the level of power slowly increases between 0 and the power in the first step is inserted before the first step from among the plurality of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment, the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in which the level of power slowly increases between 0 and power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A is inserted before the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A corresponding to the first processing. For the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a time T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of from 20 to 30 seconds is set, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in which the level of power slowly increases between 0 and power P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A is inserted before the first step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A. As is known from the result of observation described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, it is possible to prevent particularly the particles coming flying from the periphery of the semiconductor substrate from adhering to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned result of observation, more specifically, Maxell&apos;s stress acts on the thin film on the grounded insulator around the semiconductor substrate at the start of impression of the radio-frequency power of the first step, and the stripped thin film becoming particles which jump up. It is therefore possible to prevent peeling by achieving a slow change in stress acting on the thin film through insertion of the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of which the power changes slowly as described above, and to inhibit occurrence of particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as well, there are available substantially the same advantages as those described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the configuration of this embodiment, it is possible particularly to prevent adherence of the particles which jump from the periphery of the semiconductor substrate from adhering to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Fifth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of a fifth embodiment of this invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates changes with time in radio-frequency power in a case where a plurality of processes are carried out through a plurality of successive steps by means of the plasma etcher in the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices, which is a fifth embodiment of the invention. The configuraton of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment is largely different from the abovementioned configuration of the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of the fourth embodiment in that an auxiliary step of which the level of power increases over the power of the final step is inserted after the final step from among the plurality of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of this embodiment, a step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of which the level of power increases over power P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D, the final step, is inserted after the fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D corresponding to the fourth processing. A power P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of from 900 to 1,100 W and a time T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of from 1 to 5 seconds are set for the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of which the level of power increases over power P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D is inserted after the final fourth step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>D. It is therefore possible to repel the particles to the periphery particularly prior to discontinuing discharge, as is known from the result of observation described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. As a result, it is possible to prevent the particles produced in a large quantity at the end of discharge from adhering to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the plasma potential VP shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> increases according as the level of power becomes higher. In the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, therefore, the positively charged stripped particles are exposed to a larger electrostatic reaction by a positive plasma potential. The particles fly at a higher speed toward the process chamber wall while being confined in the sheath area. On the periphery of the plasma as well, the positively charged particles receive reaction by a high plasma potential. The particles drop without being directed toward a semiconductor substrate and discharged together with the gas. By inserting the auxiliary step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with an increased power, it is possible to easily exclude the particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, as described above, it is possible to prevent particles produced in a large quantity upon discontinuing discharge from adhering to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Sixth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of a sixth embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the configuration of a plasma etcher, which is a sixth embodiment of the invention. The configuration of the plasma etcher of this sixth embodiment is largely different from that of the aforementioned first embodiment in that a negative potential is given to the process chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> negative power supply <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the purpose of achieving a larger potential difference between the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the bulk plasma. By adopting such a configuration, it is possible to confine particles produced in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> within a plasma sheath, and hence to prevent the particles from adhering to the semiconductor substrate. The sixth embodiment has the same configuration as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> described above in the first embodiment except the above. A detailed description is therefore omitted. The reason will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the electrostatic potential distribution in the vertical direction during generation of plasma is such that the plasma region between the upper electrode <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a positive plasma potential VP; and grounded upper electrode <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has a potential of 0; and the lower electrode to which the radio-frequency power supply <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected has a negative potential. Under process conditions commonly adopted, the semiconductor substrate surface on the lower electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a self-bias potential VDC within a range of from &minus;200 to &minus;300 V. Regarding the electrostatic potential distribution in the horizontal direction, on the other hand, a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus using a usual plasma has a potential of 0 by grounding the plasma chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the potential difference from the positive plasma potential VP becomes larger by impressing a negative potential onto the plasma chamber wall <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. More specifically, this achieves a stronger electric field of a sheath area between the plasma chamber wall <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the plasma region, so that it becomes difficult for the positively charged particles dropping through this sheath region to enter the plasma region, thus permitting confinement of particles in the sheath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, as described above, it is possible to confine the particles in the plasma sheath, and hence to prevent the particles from adhering to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Seventh Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of a seventh embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates the configuration of the plasma etcher, which is a seventh embodiment of the invention. The configuration of the plasma etcher of the seventh embodiment is largely different from the configuration of the aforementioned first embodiment in that the component parts used in the plasma etcher are made of a material having a dielectric constant close to that of the reaction products accumulated in the process chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the plasma etcher of this embodiment <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 131</cross-reference> component parts such as a surface portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A of the gate valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> used in the plasma etcher <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a wall surface portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A of the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a peripheral portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a surface portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A of the cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a surface portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A of the anode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are made of a material having a dielectric constant close to that of the reaction products accumulated in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For example, in a case where the reaction product such as resist containing carbon is easily accumulated, the upper component parts are made of molten quartz. This permits prevention of peeling of the accumulated reaction product film, and hence to reduce occurrence of particles. The reason will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The force F acting per unit volume of a dielectric present in an electric field is expressed by the following formula according to &ldquo;Electromagnetology Theory of Phenomena&ldquo; (by S. Takeyama, Aug. 20, 1975, published by Maruzen Co., Ltd., p.130): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>F&equals;&rgr;E&minus;</italic></highlight>(&frac12;)<highlight><italic>E</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>grad </italic></highlight>&egr;&plus;(&frac12;)<highlight><italic>grad</italic></highlight>((<highlight><italic>CE</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d &egr;/dm</italic></highlight>)) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> where, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> &rgr;: true electric charge density, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> E: electric field, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> &egr;: dielectric constant, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> m: mass density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Because transfer of the true electric charge is slight in genera, application of the above formula to the plasma etcher reveals that the force F largely depends upon the second term &lsqb;(&frac12;)E<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>grad &egr;&rsqb; and the third term &lsqb;(&frac12;) grad ((E<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>m (d &egr;/dm))&rsqb; in the above formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the above formula, the second term represents the force acting on the dielectric when an electric field exists at a place where the dielectric constant varies, i.e., a force acting on the portion between the inner parts of the process chamber and the reaction product film accumulated thereon in a sheath formed near the upper electrode and the lower electrode around the plasma, or near the process chamber wall. A small change in dielectric constant, that is, if a small difference in dielectric constant between the inner parts of the process chamber and the reaction product leads to a small value of the second term, resulting in a smaller force acting on the reaction product film, and it becomes more difficult for the reaction product to peel off or to be broken. The component parts to be made of a material having a dielectric constant close to that of the reaction product are limited to the component parts around the semiconductor substrate to be processed in view of the occurring condition of particles. This measure taken only for the periphery <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the surface portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A of the anode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is well effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as well, there are available substantially the same advantages as those described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Eighth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of an eighth embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the plasma etcher of the eighth embodiment of the invention is largely different from the configuration of the above-mentioned seventh embodiment in that the component parts used in the plasma etcher are made of a material having an elastic modulus close to that of the reaction products accumulated in the process chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the plasma etcher of this embodiment having substantially the same configuration as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the component parts including the surface portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A of the gate valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> used in the plasma etcher, the wall surface portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A of the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the peripheral portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the surface portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A of the cathode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the surface portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A of the anode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are made of a material having an elastic modulus close to that of the reaction products accumulated in the process chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. By adopting this configuration, it is possible to prevent peeling of the reaction product film accumulated on the component parts, and hence to reduce occurrence of particles. The reason thereof will be described in the following paragraphs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As described above as to the plasma etcher of the seventh embodiment, transfer of true electric charge is slight in general in a plasma etcher. Therefore, the abovementioned force F largely depends upon the second term &lsqb;(&frac12;)E<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>grad &egr;&rsqb; and the third term &lsqb;(&frac12;) grad ((E<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>m (d &egr;/dm))&rsqb; in the above formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the formula, the third term represents the force produced when there is an electric field at a place where the dielectric constant varies, together with the mass density while the dielectric suffers from a strain under the effect of the force. The magnitude of the force is dependent upon the difference in elastic modulus between parts in the chamber and the reaction products. If the difference in elastic modulus between the parts in the process chamber and the reaction products is small, the third term becomes smaller. The force acting on the reaction product film therefore becomes smaller, making it more difficult for the reaction product film to peel off or to be broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as well, as described above, there are available substantially the same advantages as those described in the seventh embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention have been described above in detail with reference to the drawings. Detailed configurations are not however limited to these embodiments, but design variants within a range not deviating from the spirit of the invention are within the scope of the present invention. For example, a plasma etcher has been explained as an example of the plasma generator, but it is not limited to this, but the invention is applicable to any of the other plasma generators such as a plasma CVD apparatus or a plasma sputtering apparatus. A case of forming a DRAM wiring has been described as a manufacturing method of semiconductor devices. This is not however limitative, but the invention is applicable to any processing of a thin film comprising an insulating film or a conductive film, or a semiconductor substrate itself into a desired shape. Numerical values of radio-frequency power and values of impressing time shown in the embodiments are only examples, and may be appropriately changed in response to the purpose of uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As a variant of the sixth, seventh and eighth embodiments, a negative power supply may be connected to a liner detachably attached in the interior of the process chamber for the purpose of facilitating maintenance. Since this liner, like the process chamber, is made usually of aluminum, almost the same advantages as in the case of direct connection of the negative power supply to the process chamber. As a variant of the seventh and eighth embodiments, the component part used in the plasma etcher may be made of a material having a dielectric constant and an elastic modulus close to those of the reaction products accumulated in the process chamber, providing substantially the same advantages as those available in the seventh and eighth embodiments. Apart from single application of the individual embodiments, they may be implemented in the form of an appropriate combination. This synergetically provide the inhibiting effect of adhesion of particles produced in the process chamber to the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> According to the manufacturing method of semiconductor devices of the present invention, as described above, when conducting a plurality of processes while holding the semiconductor substrate in the process chamber, these processes are carried out through a plurality of successive steps by switching over the level of radio-frequency power in response to each processing. The radio-frequency power never becomes 0 during processing steps, thus achieving a very slight extent of dropping of the particles in the process chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When carrying out a plurality of processes through a plurality of successive steps by use of plasma, therefore, it is possible to inhibit occurrence of particles adhering to the semiconductor substrate, or even if particles are produced, it is possible to inhibit the number of particles adhering to the semiconductor substrate, thus reducing the adverse effect of the particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> While this invention has thus far been disclosed in conjunction with several embodiments thereof, it will be readily possible for those skilled in the art to put this invention into practice in various other manners. </paragraph>
