<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing semiconductor devices, and more particularly to an etching method using a photoresist etch barrier formed by an exposure with a light source of which wavelength is in the range of 157 nm to 193 nm, such as an argon fluoride(ArF) laser or fluorine laser(F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory device fabrication processes, photolithography is used to form patterns on a substrate with various materials. A photoresist, polymer is coated on a target layer, and exposed selectively with a mask to induce photoreaction in the photoresist. Then, the photoresist is developed to form an etch barrier for etching the target layer, and a predetermined patterns are obtained by etching the target layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The integration of the semiconductor memory device has been improved using lithography technology. Generally, lithography processes are carried out with an exposing process and a developing process. Recently, lithography processes usually represent an exposing process and lithography technology is classified into optical lithography or non-optical lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The development of photolithography has been accomplished by the development in the every filed of an exposure equipment, a photoresist material, a mask and a process. In the field of exposure system, a high numerical aperture lens of over 0.6 mm and hardware, that provide alignment, has been developed. With respect to the development of the photoresist material, a chemically amplified can be a representative. The developments of a phase shift mask and an optical proximity correction are good representatives in the field of the mask. Also, tri-linear resist (TLR), bi-linear resist (BLR), top surface imaging (TSI) and anti reflective coating (ARC) processes have been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The initial exposure equipment is a contact printer, where a mask is directly contacted with a substrate and aligned by an operator who looks directly at the mask and the substrate with the naked eye. As the gap between the substrate and the mask is decreased, resolution can be improved and the substrate is exposed with an approach printer, such as soft contact or hard contact (below 10 &mgr;m) depending on the gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the early 1970s, exposure equipment of a projection type applying an optical device using reflection or refraction of light was developed, resolution was improved and the lifetime of a mask was extended. As a result, the exposure equipment of the projection type started to be applied into the product development of large substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the mid-1970s, use of a stepper using a projection optical device began, started the development of lithography technology which contributed to mass-production of semiconductors. The stepper is an abbreviated form of &ldquo;step and repeat&rdquo;. The exposure equipment using the stepper was implemented to improve the resolution and alignment accuracy. In the initial stepper, a reduced projection exposing method, which a ratio of the mask pattern to the substrate was 5:1 or 10:1, was designed. However, the reduced projection exposing method of 5:1 was generally employed due to limitations of the mask pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A scanner of a &ldquo;step and scanning&rdquo; type was developed in the early 1990s, which reduced the ratio to 4:1. However, the scanner performed poorly in terms of the mask pattern, whereas the scanner as an exposure equipment was used to increase production efficiency and was applied more regularly as chip sizes decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The resolution is largely related with wavelength of the light source. The wavelength of the stepper employing the step and repeat type had been changed 436 nm(g-line), 365 nm(iline), 248 nm a KrF laser(Deep Ultra-Violet, DUV), in this order. An initial exposure equipment using g-line (wavelength (&lgr;)&equals;436 nm) could implement a pattern of a 0.5 &mgr;m level and an exposure equipment using i-line (&lgr;&equals;365 nm) could implement a pattern of a 0.3 &mgr;m level. In the DUV photolithography using light, of which wavelength is 248 nm, a pattern of a 0.8 &mgr;m level could be implemented because of the problems of a time delay effect and a base dependency. Accordingly, it is needed to develop a new DUV photolithography employing an ArF laser of which wavelength is 193 nm in order to form a pattern of below 0.15 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The DUV lithography technology has excellent resolution for the i-line and DOF, however, such technology is difficult to control. This problem can arise optically due to a short wavelength and/or chemically due to use of a chemical amplified resister. As the wavelength becomes shorter, critical dimension (CD) is varied due to a standing wave and overdeveloping is generated by reflection light due to a difference of base phases. The CD variation of a line width is periodically changed by interference of incident light and reflective light and is also changed by a minute variation of a thickness of a photoresist or a base film. A chemical amplified resist has to be employed for improving sensitivity in the DUV process. However, there are problems of PED (post exposure delay) stability, base dependency and the like with respect to the reaction mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Now, an exposure equipment using an ArF laser (&lgr;&equals;193 nm) is developed to form a pattern of 0.11 &mgr;m. A main issue with ArF exposure technology is the development of a photoresist for ArF. Basically, the photoresist used for KrF has to be improved to be used for ArF. However, the photoresist for KrF, such as a polymer type of a COMA (cycloolefin-maleic anhydride) family, an acrylate family or a mixture type, having a benzene ring structure cannot be used in case of employing the ArF laser. The photoresist with the benzene ring structure has been used in case of employing the KrF laser for the i-line to secure tolerance for dry etching. When the photoresist with the benzene ring structure is used in case of employing the ArF laser, since the absorbency of light is increased in a wavelength of 193 nm, which is a wavelength of the ArF laser, the permeability of light is reduced so that it is impossible to expose the lower side of the photoresist. In addition, when the ArF lithography technology is employed using the photoresist, in which the benzene rings are contained, the deformation of photoresist pattern is caused. Also, the photoresist pattern can be clustered on one side in the etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, in the etching process, photoresist pattern of a striation type, formed by exposure with ArF laser, is deformed. The deformation of the photoresist pattern formed by exposure with ArF laser, is also generated in the etching process for forming a contact hole. Therefore, it is impossible to obtain a contact hole of which the critical dimension is 0.1 &mgr;m or less with the photoresist pattern because of the photography limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a photoresist, which does not have benzene rings, secures tolerance for dry etching, has good adhesiveness and can be developed with 2.23% TMAH, has been developed. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the reference numeral &lsquo;<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&rsquo; denotes a substrate and &lsquo;<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&rsquo; denotes interlayer insulating layer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the bit line contact plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed after forming the bit line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> because of the limitation of the critical dimension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, undercuts <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be formed by the damage caused during the etching process for forming bit line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Also, the exposed bit line contact plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is damaged during the etch process for forming the bit line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a trench T is formed in the contact plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the trench T is filled with an insulation layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and thus a void V is formed in the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The bit line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be shorted with other conduction lines owing to the void V, and a contact resistance can be increased owing to the insulating layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> filled in the trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, it is not easy to reduce the critical dimension of the contact hole, therefore a method of flowing the photoresist pattern is performed at a high temperature to define a contact region having a reduced critical dimension, however the method causes another burden of thinning the photoresist pattern which covers neighboring regions of the contact hole. Accordingly, the critical dimension of the contact hole is limited to 90 nm even if the method of flowing the photoresist pattern is used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D are cross-sectional views illustrating a process for forming contact hole according to a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, gate electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as an example of adjacent conductive patterns, are formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a hard mask <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and spacers <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed on top surface and the sidewalls of electrode, respectively, and then an interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The hard mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> prevents the gate electrode from being damaged during a subsequent self-align contact etch process. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hard mask and the spacers are formed of nitride layer, and the interlayer insulating layer is formed of an oxide of advanced planarization layer, a boro phospho silicate(BPSG), a spin on glass(SOG), a high density plasma oxide or a nitride layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a photoresist is coated on the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and photoresist patterns <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed by exposure with a light source of which wavelength is in the range of 157 nm to 193 nm, such as an ArF laser or F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the photoresist patterns <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed by coating resist of a COMA (cycloolefin-maleic anhydride) family or an acrylate family to a thickness ranging from about 500 &angst; to about 6000 &angst;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The hardened photoresist patterns <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed by an Ar plasma treatment or an Ar ion implantation in order to improve the etch tolerance. The Ar plasma treatment is performed at a low pressure ranging from about 1 mTorr to about 10 mTorr and a high power ranging from about 500 W to about 2000 W. The Ar ion implantation is performed by implanting Ar ions with a dose ranging from about 10<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to about 10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>with an energy ranging from 100 KeV to 300 KeV.
