<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed in general to monitoring operational parameters and fault-related information of a railroad locomotive, and more specifically, to a method and apparatus for remotely identifying incorrect versions of software resident on the locomotive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cost efficient railroad operation requires minimization of locomotive down time, and especially the avoidance of line-of-road locomotive failures. Failure of a major locomotive system can cause serious damage, require costly repairs, and introduce significant operational delays. A line-of-road failure is an especially costly event as it requires dispatching a replacement locomotive to pull the train, possibly rendering a track segment unusable until the disabled train is moved. Therefore, the health of the locomotive engine and its constituent sub-assemblies is of significant concern to the railroad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Today&apos;s modern locomotive includes multiple microprocessors, each controlled by one or more software programs. Because there are literally dozens of such software programs on the locomotive, it is critical for operational and maintenance purposes to ascertain the version number of the software programs and ensure that this version number is correct. In some cases, certain software versions may be incompatible with other software running on the locomotive or a particular software version may not match the hardware configuration. Additionally, incorrect software versions can cause operational problems and delays in detecting the root cause of fault conditions. In fact, the root cause may simply be the incorrect software version. It is therefore critical to periodically determine whether the software version number is correct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One apparatus for minimizing locomotive down time measures performance and fault-related operational parameters of the locomotive during operation. Analysis of this information can provide timely indications of expected and immediate component failures. With timely and nearly continuous access to locomotive performance data, it is possible for locomotive repair experts to predict and/or prevent untimely failures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such an apparatus is described and claimed in the commonly owned patent application entitled &ldquo;On-Board Monitor for a Railroad Locomotive&rdquo;. This application bears application number ______ (attorney docket number 624226.133/20-LC-1978) and was filed on ______. The on-board monitor described therein collects, aggregates, and communicates locomotive performance and fault related data from an operating locomotive to a remote monitoring and diagnostic center. The data is collected periodically or as required by various triggering events that occur on the locomotive during operation. Generally, anomalous or fault data is brought to the attention of the locomotive operator directly by these control systems, but the locomotive itself lacks the necessary hardware and software elements to diagnose the fault. It is therefore advantageous to utilize an on-board monitor to collect and aggregate the information and at the appropriate time send it to a remote monitoring and diagnostic service center. Upon receipt of the performance data at the remote site, data analysis tools operate on the data to identify the root cause of potential or actual faults. Experts in locomotive operation and maintenance also analyze the received data to develop repair recommendations for preventative maintenance or to correct faults. Historical anomalous data patterns can be important clues to an accurate diagnosis and repair recommendation. The lessons learned from failure modes in a single locomotive can also be applied to similar locomotives so that the necessary preventive maintenance can be performed before a line-of-service break down occurs. When the data analysis process identifies incipient problems, certain performance aspects of the locomotive can be derated to avoid further system degradation and further limit violations of operational thresholds until the locomotive can undergo repair at a repair facility. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The on-board monitor aboard the locomotive monitors and collects data indicative of the vehicle operation from several locomotive control systems. In addition to operational parameters, the on-board monitor retrieves the identification number for various software programs on board the locomotive. The software identification information is sent to the remote monitoring and diagnostic center where it is checked against the expected configuration information. Mismatches are notated for resolution by experts in locomotive operation and maintenance resident at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Before describing in detail the particular configuration apparatus and method in accordance with the present invention, it should be observed that the present invention resides primarily in a novel combination of processing steps and hardware related to a software configuration technique. Accordingly, these processing steps and hardware components have been represented by conventional processes and elements in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with structural details that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the description herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the environment in which the present invention operates. A locomotive on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is coupled to a plurality of locomotive control systems, depicted generally by reference character <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These locomotive control systems can include: a locomotive controller, an excitation controller, an auxiliary equipment controller, and a propulsion system controller. The specific nature and function of the controllers are not germane to the present invention, except to the extent that the on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitors various parameters associated with these control systems. The on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is described in greater detail in commonly owned patent application entitled &ldquo;On-board Monitor for a Railroad Locomotive&rdquo;, bearing application number ______ filed on ______ (attorney docket number 624226.133/GE 20-LC-1978). This patent application is incorporated herein by reference. The data collected by the on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides important locomotive performance and status information, which is analyzed at a remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to identify active faults, predict incipient failures, and provide timely information about existing operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> serves the functions of a signal acquisition, signal conditioning, data processing, and logging instrument that provides status information to the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a bi-directional communication path <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Certain parametric and fault-related information gathered by the on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is collected and stored as data in raw data files. Other data collected generates operational statistics and is stored as statistical parameters. Both the raw data files and the statistical data files are downloaded to the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on a periodic basis. Likewise, operational and reconfiguration commands are uploaded to the on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The data analysis processes carried out at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are discussed in detail in the commonly-owned patent applications entitled &ldquo;Diagnosis and Repair System&rdquo;, bearing application number ______, filed on ______, (attorney docket number 624226.127/20-LC-1950), and &ldquo;Apparatus and Method for Performance and Fault Data Analysis&rdquo;, bearing application number ______, filed on ______, (attorney docket number 624226.144/20-LC-1974, 1975, 1976, 1998). These applications are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an interface device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a transceiver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The interface device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> communicates bi-directionally with the various locomotive control systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The interface device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> performs typical signal acquisition and conditioning processes, as is well known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a hard drive, input devices such as a keyboard or a mouse, magnetic storage media (e.g., tape cartridges or disks), optical storage media (e.g., CD-ROM&apos;s) and output devices such as a display and a printer. The processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> controls operation of the on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including especially the control over the nature and frequency at which data is collected from the locomotive control systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, under control of the processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, communicates with a transmitter/receiver device in the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via an antenna <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As is known to those skilled in the art, there are a number of appropriate communication schemes for implementing this link, including: cellular telephone, satellite phone, or point-to-point microwave. Since the locomotive spends considerable time in transit hauling either freight or passengers, sometimes in remote regions, it has been observed that a satellite-based link provides the most reliable communications medium between the locomotive and the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As taught by the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the process of comparing the software configuration version on board the locomotive with those versions identified in the locomotive configuration file at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center. This process is executed by the processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At a step <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, parametric data is downloaded from the on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This data includes not only the version number for locomotive software, but also locomotive operational data for analysis at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Exemplary software programs for which the version numbers are checked include inverter control software, propulsion system control software, and auxiliary system control software. The nature and function of these software programs are well known to those skilled in the art. At a step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the files are untarred, unzipped, decoded and stored at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. At a step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the on-board monitor start-up files, where the software version configuration information is stored, are retrieved. The program then opens the start-up file for the first selected on-board monitor and reads the values that identify the railroad customer, the locomotive road number, and other identification parameters. At a step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the program retrieves the software version numbers for the customer and locomotive identified at the step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, from a configuration file at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Further, at the step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the expected software configuration version numbers are compared with the actual software configuration version numbers. At a decision step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether these version numbers match. If the version numbers match, processing moves to a decision step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Here, the system determines whether there are any other files in the on-board monitor start-up file still awaiting comparison. If all the files have not yet been compared, then processing moves from the decision step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> back to the step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, where another software version number is retrieved. If there are no further files to compare, then processing moves to the end step <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Returning to the decision step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, if the actual value of the software version does not match the expected value, then processing moves to a step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> where a case is created at the remote monitoring and diagnostic center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This case is added to the work queue where it will eventually be analyzed for the process of formulating a recommendation. In most situations, this recommendation will simply involve upgrading the software version at the locomotive. After the creation of a case at the step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, processing returns to the decision step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Note that while there are several software configuration version numbers stored in the on-board monitor start-up file, only one case will be created for each start-up file, regardless of the number of version mismatches within that file. Once all values in the first file have been retrieved and compared, the program then opens the next on-board monitor start-up file, with software version information from another on-board monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> aboard a different locomotive. This process of opening files and reviewing the software version numbers continues until all the files in the directory have been processed. Also, if the program is unable to process all the values within a file, then a descriptive error message is created, for later analysis by a locomotive expert at the remote monitoring and diagnostic service center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalent elements may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation more material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment described as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
