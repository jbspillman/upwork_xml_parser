<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical pickup device forming an optical recording/reading apparatus of what is called an optical disk system, a magneto-optical disk system, an optical card system, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, optical disks, such as CDs (compact disks) (trademark) and DVDs (digital versatile disks) (trademark), have been proposed as optical recording media. In addition, optical pickup devices for writing information signals to and reading out information signals from such optical disks have been proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, in order to increase the recording capacity of such optical disks, in optical pickup devices, the wavelengths of light beams emitted from a light source are made shorter, and the NA (numerical aperture) of an objective lens for converging the light beams on a signal recording surface of such optical disks is made high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, the wavelength of light emitted from a semiconductor laser (LD), serving as a light source, in an optical pickup device is 780 nm in an optical pickup device for a CD and is 650 nm in an optical pickup device for a DVD having a larger recording capacity. The numerical aperture (NA) of an objective lens in an optical pickup device is 0.45 in an optical pickup device for a CD and is 0.60 in an optical pickup device for a DVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor laser having a light-emitting wavelength of 405 nm (blue violet) and an objective lens having a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.85 have been proposed. By using such a semiconductor laser and an objective lens in the optical pickup device, the recording capacity of an optical disk is further increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, when, as mentioned above, the light-emitting wavelength of a semiconductor laser (light source) is made shorter, and the numerical aperture of an objective lens is made high, wave aberrations are-considerably increased in an optical system due to various production errors. More specifically, in the case where production errors are about the same, the shorter the light-emitting wavelength of a semiconductor laser is made, or the higher the numerical ratio of an objective lens is made, the larger the wave aberrations become. When wave aberrations in an optical system increase, optical performance is reduced, so that proper writing and reading out of information signals cannot be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there has been proposed, for example, a related optical pickup device for a DVD including a mechanism for changing relative tiltings between the optical pickup device and an optical disk so that, when skewing of the optical disk occurs, the optical axis is always made perpendicular to a read-out surface of the optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, it is not possible to properly correct various wave aberrations that occur due to the occurrence of various production errors in an optical device by only adjusting the tilting of the entire optical pickup device with respect to the optical disk in this way. In particular, it is not possible to correct wave aberrations caused by thickness and tilting errors of the optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Various other structures for correcting wave aberrations in an optical pickup device have hitherto been proposed. One example is a structure using a liquid crystal device. In this structure, the liquid crystal device is inserted at a light path between a light source and an objective lens, and, by the liquid crystal device, a desired phase distribution is given to transmission light. In other words, in this structure, a phase that is opposite to that produced by any wave aberrations that occur is previously given to incident light using the liquid crystal device, so that there are no aberrations at an image-forming surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal device, substrates which sandwich liquid crystal molecules are ordinarily planar glass substrates. Electrodes for applying an electrical voltage to the liquid crystals are formed on the substrates. The liquid crystal molecules are lined up along alignment films formed on the glass substrates, and are moved by the application of an electrical voltage using the electrodes formed on the substrates. Such movements of the liquid crystal molecules change the refractive index of the entire liquid crystal device, so that the phase of the transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device can be changed. In order to give a phase distribution to the transmission light, an electrical voltage distribution is created in the electrical voltage applied using the electrodes. An example of a simple structure for achieving this is formed by dividing the electrodes into at least two portions. By separately applying voltages corresponding to desired phase distributions to the divided electrode portions, voltage distributions which match the number of electrodes and the applied voltages are formed, so that nearly desired phase distributions are provided in the transmission light. Obviously, when the number of divisions of the electrodes is larger, so that the divided electrode portions are smaller, it is possible to produce an ideal phase distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, in such a liquid crystal device, the larger the number of divisions of the electrodes, the larger the area of electrodeless portions, formed between the electrode portions, becomes. Since the refractive indices of the liquid crystals at the electrodeless portions differ from the refractive indices of the liquid crystals at the electrode portions, not only is image formation adversely affected, but also diffraction of light and other phenomena occur at the boundary between the liquid crystals at the electrode portions, thereby resulting in loss in the quantity of light. If a semiconductor laser, serving as a light source, has enough power, such a loss in the quantity of light caused by diffraction of light is not a problem, but, in order to increase the life of the semiconductor laser, it is desirable that the loss in the quantity of light in the liquid crystal device be small. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention has been proposed in view of the above-described circumstances, and has as its object the provision of an optical pickup device which can, while keeping loss of light emitted from a light source as low as possible, properly correct wave aberrations that occur due to various production errors in an optical device, particularly, aberrations resulting from errors in thickness and tilting of an optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To this end, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical pickup device comprising a light source; an objective lens for converging a light beam emitted from the light source at a signal recording surface of an optical recording medium and irradiating the signal recording surface of the optical recording medium with the light beam; and a liquid crystal device, disposed in a light path between the light source and the objective lens, for giving a predetermined phase distribution to transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device, with both front and back surfaces of the liquid crystal device being flat surfaces. In the optical pickup device, the liquid crystal device includes a pair of transparent substrates and a liquid crystal molecule layer that is formed so as to be sandwiched between the pair of transparent substrates. In addition, a liquid-crystal-molecule-layer-sandwiching-side surface of at least one of the pair of transparent substrates has a shape that is formed such that a thickness distribution of the liquid crystal molecule layer is similar to a phase distribution that is produced when spherical aberration occurs due to an error in a thickness of a transparent layer that covers the signal recording surface of the optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Although not exclusive, a liquid-crystal-molecule-layer-sandwiching-side surface of the other of the pair of transparent substrates may be a flat surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical pickup device comprising a light source; an objective lens for converging a light beam emitted from the light source selectively at one of a plurality of signal recording surfaces of a multilayer optical recording medium; and a liquid crystal device, disposed in a light path between the light source and the objective lens, for giving a predetermined phase distribution to transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device, with both front and back surfaces of the liquid crystal device being flat surfaces. In the optical pickup device, the liquid crystal device includes a pair of transparent substrates and a liquid crystal molecule layer that is formed so as to be sandwiched between the pair of transparent substrates. In addition, a liquid-crystal-molecule-layer-sandwiching-side surface of at least one of the pair of transparent substrates has a shape that is formed such that a thickness distribution of the liquid crystal molecule layer is similar to a phase distribution that is produced when spherical aberration occurs in accordance with a thickness of a transparent layer that covers the selected signal recording surface of the multilayer optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although not exclusive, a liquid-crystal-molecule-layer-sandwiching-side surface of the other of the pair of transparent substrates may be a flat surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical pickup device comprising a light source; an objective lens for converging a light beam emitted from the light source at a signal recording surface of an optical recording medium and irradiating the signal recording surface of the optical recording medium with the light beam; and a liquid crystal device, disposed in a light path between the light source and the objective lens, for giving a predetermined phase distribution to transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device, with both front and back surfaces of the liquid crystal device being flat surfaces. In the optical pickup device, the liquid crystal device includes a pair of transparent substrates-and a liquid crystal molecule layer that is formed so as to be sandwiched between the pair of transparent substrates. In addition, a liquid-crystal-molecule-layer-sandwiching-side surface of at least one of the pair of transparent substrates has a shape that is formed such that a thickness distribution of the liquid crystal molecule layer is similar to a phase distribution that is produced when coma occurs due to tilting of the optical recording medium with respect to an optical axis of the objective lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although not exclusive, a liquid-crystal-molecule-layer-sandwiching-side surface of the other of the pair of transparent substrates may be a flat surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In such an optical pickup device of the present invention, electrodes are formed over the entire surfaces of the pair of transparent substrates which sandwich the liquid crystal molecule layer, without dividing the electrodes. In addition, a uniform voltage is applied to the electrodes. In other words, the phase distribution of the transmission light is determined by the thickness of the liquid crystal molecules through which the transmission light passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the optical pickup device of the present invention, since the electrodes in the liquid crystal device are not divided, loss in the quantity of transmission light caused by diffraction or the like does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The phase distribution of light that passes through the liquid crystal device is determined by the length of the light path taken by the light that passes through the liquid crystal device, so that it is determined by the thickness distribution of the liquid crystals. Since the liquid crystal thickness distribution is determined by the shapes of the transparent substrates, if the surfaces of the transparent substrates can be formed with shapes similar to desired phase distributions, the transmission light can be given ideal phase distributions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention makes it possible to provide an optical pickup device which can, while keeping loss of light emitted from a light source as low as possible, properly correct wave aberrations that occur due to various production errors in an optical device, particularly, aberrations resulting from errors in thickness and tilting of an optical recording medium.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Hereunder, a description of an embodiment of the present invention will be given in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an optical pickup device of the present invention comprises a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serving as a light source, an objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for converging light beams emitted from the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on a signal recording surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of an optical disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (optical recording medium) and irradiating the signal recording surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the converged light beams, and liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed in a light path between the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The optical disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is formed by placing a base material <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a protective layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> upon each other, with a surface of the base material <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being covered by the protective layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> being the signal recording surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Light beams from the optical pickup device pass through the protective layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and are used to irradiate the signal recording surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Both front and back surfaces of the liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are flat surfaces. The liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> give predetermined phase distributions to transmission light that passes therethrough as described later. In the optical pickup device, light beams, which are linearly polarized light beams, emitted from the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are collimated by a collimator lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and formed into plane waves. The plane waves are incident upon a beam splitter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The plane waves, which are p-polarized light waves with respect to a reflective surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, pass through the reflective surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and through the liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, the plane waves are converted into circularly polarized light waves by passing through a &lgr;/4 plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the circularly polarized light waves reach the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> converges the incident light beams at the signal recording surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for irradiating the signal recording surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the light beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By a biaxial actuator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supported so as to be movably operable in a focusing direction (that is, the direction of the optical axis of the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that is indicated by arrow F in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in a tracking direction (that is, a direction orthogonal to the optical axis of the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that is indicated by arrow T in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. By operation of the biaxial actuator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a focusing adjustment and a tracking adjustment are carried out. </paragraph>

The circularly polarized light beams pass through the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the &lgr;/4 plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and become linearly polarized light beams that are in a direction perpendicular to the polarization direction of the light beams that have traveled towards the optical disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The linearly polarized light beams pass through the liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and return to the beam splitter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The light beams that have returned from the optical disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are, at the beam splitter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, s-polarized light beams with respect to the reflective surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that they are reflected by the reflective surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The phase distribution of the transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined by the length of the light path in the liquid crystal device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. in other words, the phase distribution of the transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined by the product of a thickness distribution d(x) of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a difference &Dgr;n between the refractive indices of the liquid-crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and each of the glass substrates <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, that is, it is determined by d(x)&middot;&Dgr;n.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the wave surface that is produced when spherical aberration occurs is one in which there is a difference between the phases at the center portion and the peripheral portion of a light beam. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the wave surface that is produced when coma occurs is one in which a difference between the phases of one side and the other side of the light beam gradually occurs. Therefore, when the wave surfaces of the transmission light that passes through the liquid crystal device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are previously given phase distributions having polarities that are the reverse of the polarities of the phase distributions that are produced when these aberrations occur, there are no aberrations at the time of image formation by the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to correct spherical aberration, the thickness distribution of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of a liquid crystal device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is set to provide a shape that is represented by Formula (1), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In order to correct coma, the thickness distribution of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of a liquid crystal device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is set to provide a shape that is represented by Formula (2), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Such a liquid crystal device for correcting spherical aberration and such a liquid crystal device for correcting coma may both be superimposed upon each other in a light path leading to the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or either one of them may be disposed in this light path. When a liquid crystal device for correcting spherical aberration and a liquid crystal device for correcting coma are superimposed upon each other, it does not matter in what order they are superimposed upon each other, so that either one of them can be disposed closer to the objective lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are superimposed upon each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the optical pickup device, even if the thickness distributions of the liquid crystal layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are not similar to the phase distributions that are produced when spherical aberration and coma occur, the liquid crystal devices <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can correct aberrations. For example, even if the thickness distribution of a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is set to provide a shape that corresponds to a phase distribution that is produced when an aberration due to defocusing is added to the spherical aberration, a focusing servo operation by the biaxial actuator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> corrects the aberration caused by the defocusing, so that the aberration can be corrected. However, there is little point in forming such a shape, so that, in order to correct aberrations by minimally correcting a phase, it is sufficient to give a phase distribution having a reverse polarity in relation to the amplitude and the phase distributions resulting from the aberrations. Therefore, the shapes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> are optimal ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The present invention is effective in an optical pickup device used with what is called a multilayer disk. In a multilayer disk, a transparent protective layer is interposed between each of a plurality of signal recording surfaces that have been placed upon each other. Therefore, the thicknesses measured from the surface of the optical disk to each of the signal recording surfaces differ, so that the spherical aberrations that occur are different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For example, for a DVD, a two-layer disk is used. The optical pickup device is designed so that the interval between the two layers is within an allowable spherical aberration range, so that it does not particularly include a mechanism for correcting spherical aberration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> However, in a DVD, when more than two layers of signal recording surfaces are used, or when the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens is made large even if two layers are used, a large spherical aberration that cannot be allowed occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Here, spherical aberration might seem to be reduced by reducing the distance between the layers, that is, by bringing the signal recording surfaces closer-together. However, in the case where the distance between the layers is reduced, when a recording operation or a reading operation is being performed on a certain signal recording surface, stray light returns to the optical pickup device from a different signal recording surface, so that precise recording and reading operations can no longer be carried out. Therefore, there is a limit as to how small the inter-layer distances can be made. This limit depends upon the design of the system including an optical system and the light-emitting wavelength of the light source. However, when the lower limit of the distance between the layers that does not cause stray light from a different signal recording surface to become a problem is greater than the upper limit of an allowable spherical aberration distance between the layers, it is necessary to efficiently correct spherical aberration by some means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> To achieve this, when an attempt is made to correct spherical aberration using a related liquid crystal device including divided electrodes, spherical aberration can only be approximately corrected, so that the remaining aberration is large, thereby making it impossible to correct large spherical aberration such as that in a multilayer disk. Even if a spherical wave is generated and caused to be incident upon an objective lens, the aberration can only be approximately corrected, so that the remaining aberration is large, thereby making it impossible to correct a large spherical aberration in a multilayer disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In contrast to this, since, in the present invention, changes in the shape of the wave surface caused by spherical aberration are themselves changed when correcting spherical aberration, when a large spherical aberration that occurs in a multilayer disk is corrected, the remaining aberration is small, so that spherical aberration can be properly corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Although, in the above-described embodiment, in a liquid crystal device, only one of the liquid-crystal-layer-sandwiching surfaces of the glass substrates is formed with a shape that is similar to a desired phase distribution, the present invention is not limited thereto, so that both of the liquid-crystal-layer sandwiching surfaces of the glass substrates may be formed with shapes that are similar to desired phase distributions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In other words, since the phase distributions that one wants to give to the transmission light that passes through a liquid crystal device is determined by the product of the thickness distribution d(x) of the liquid crystal layer that is sandwiched by the glass substrates and a difference &Dgr;n between the refractive indices-of the liquid crystal layer and each of the glass substrates, that is, by the d(x)&middot;&Dgr;n, all that needs to be done is to form the liquid crystal layer into a shape that is formed when the thickness distribution is similar to the desired phase distribution, independent of the shapes of the glass substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The shape of the surface of each of the glass Substrates that sandwiches the liquid crystal layer of a liquid crystal device may be formed by using an ultraviolet (UV) curing agent to form a predetermined surface shape, and bonding these surfaces having the predetermined shapes to flat glass substrates. </paragraph>
