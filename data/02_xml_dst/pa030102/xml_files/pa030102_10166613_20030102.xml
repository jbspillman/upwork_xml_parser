<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. P2001-38131 filed in Korea on Jun. 29, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a ferroelectric memory, and more particularly, to a circuit for testing a ferroelectric capacitor in a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) which measures variations of a current and a voltage at the ferroelectric capacitor in the FRAM for providing an accurate ferroelectric model parameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The FRAM, having in general a data processing speed similar to a DRAM(Dynamic Random Access Memory), and being capable of conserving data even if the power is turned off, is paid attention as a next generation memory. The FRAM, a memory having a structure similar to the DRAM, is provided with a capacitor of a ferroelectric material for utilizing a high residual polarization of the ferroelectric material. The residual polarization permits the conservation of a data even after removal of an electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A related art FRAM will be explained, with reference to the attached drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a characteristic curve of a hysteresis loop of a general ferroelectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it can be known that a polarization induced by an electric field is, not erased totally, but, a certain amount(&lsquo;d&rsquo; or &lsquo;a&rsquo; state) of which is remained, even if the electric field is removed owing to existence of the residual polarization(or spontaneous polarization). The &lsquo;d&rsquo; and &lsquo;a&rsquo; states are corresponded to &lsquo;1&rsquo; and &lsquo;0&rsquo; respectively in application to a memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a basic sawyer tower circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sawyer tower has a sense capacitor connected to the ferroelectric capacitor which is an object of measurement in series. In order to make an accurate measurement of voltage variation at the ferroelectric capacitor, a capacitance of the sense capacitor is made great for inducing most of voltage drop at the ferroelectric capacitor. Because a small sized sense capacitor is not adequate to measure the voltage drop at the ferroelectric capacitor. A drive voltage is applied to a drive terminal, and the voltage drop at the ferroelectric capacitor is measured at both electrode terminals of the sense capacitor. That is, voltages at the both electrodes of the sense capacitor are sensed, to detect a voltage change at the ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram showing a measuring apparatus, measuring cable, and a measuring device with a probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> measured signal is received at the measuring apparatus through a return terminal, wherein the measured signal is delayed due to a parasitic capacitance and/or a parasitic resistance at the return terminal, and distorted as the measured signal is exposed to noise sources. Therefore, there is a limitation in fast speed measuring a voltage variation of the ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, the related art circuit for testing a ferroelectric capacitor in a FRAM has the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For obtaining accurate modeling parameters of a ferroelectric capacitor in a FRAM, measurements of ferroelectric capacitor characteristics should be possible. In the meantime, the ferroelectric capacitor has very great time dependences on phenomena, such as degradation, and relaxation, and the like, caused by imprint, and fatigue, etc., to exhibit characteristic variations even within a minute time period. The related art circuit for measuring a ferroelectric capacitor has limitations in a capacitor size, or a measuring time period due to noise sources affecting the return terminal. There has been no device that can measure such time dependences on degradation, relaxation, and the like accurately yet, and, with respect to a measurable capacitor size, measurement of a memory of a cell size level is not possible, but measurement of a memory of only a large size level is possible. Therefore, it is difficult to provide model parameters having accurate ferroelectric characteristics reflected thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The circuit for testing a ferroelectric capacitor in an FRAM in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is operative in two modes of a data write mode and a test mode. In the data write mode, the drive voltage Vdr is applied to the second electrode V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ferroelectric capacitor as the write pulse bar signal /write, and, in the test mode, the drive voltage Vdr is applied to the second electrode V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ferroelectric capacitor as the test pulse signal &lsquo;test&rsquo;. That is, the circuit for testing a ferroelectric capacitor in an FRAM in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is operative in the data write mode, or the test mode depending on the drive voltage Vdr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Functions of different parts of the circuit for testing a ferroelectric capacitor in an FRAM in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The test pulse signal generating part <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be disposed inside, or outside of a chip. For an example, a pulse generator, such as a quartz oscillator, is employed for implementing the test mode in which capacitor characteristics are obtained. The reference voltage generating part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> receives a power source voltage Vcc from outside of the circuit, and generates the reference voltage signal Vref, which serves as a reference in comparison of all voltages in the capacitor circuit in the test mode. The reference voltage generating part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provides the reference voltage Vref to be one half &frac12; Vcc of the external power source voltage Vcc. The test pulse signal &lsquo;test&rsquo; from the test pulse signal generating part <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has an analog waveform. Therefore, it is necessary to convert such an analog signal &lsquo;test&rsquo; to a digital signal d<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>test for implementing a stable circuit in the test mode. The test pulse providing part <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> converts the test pulse signal &lsquo;test&rsquo; generated as an analog signal to a digital test pulse signal d_test. The test pulse providing part <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is operative with reference to the reference voltage Vref form the reference voltage providing part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The J/K inputs to the J/K flipflop are always the same, to provide total cases of all the inputs are at a low level, or all the inputs are at a high level. As the clock signal CLK, the digital test pulse signal d_test from the test pulse providing part is used. The third inverter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> inverts the clock signal CLK, and the third, fourth NAND gates <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are operative synchronous to the inverted signal /CLK of the clock signal CLK. As the digital pulse signal d_test is used as the clock signal CLK, the inverted signal /CLK of the clock signal CLK is the digital inverted signal /d_test. That is, the J/K flipflop has an output signal alternating from a high level to a low level, and vice versa, synchronous to the clock inversion signal &lsquo;/CLK&rsquo; when the signals both to the J/K terminals are at high. The J/K flipflop having three of such a J/K flop connected serves as a three bit down counter; i.e., makes 8 times of clock counting from (H-H-H) to (L-L-L) per one cycle by using the digital test signal. </paragraph>

If it is desired to have a longer delay period, the output &lsquo;b&rsquo; from the delay part may be taken at an output terminal on one of the later delay blocks. Since the delay blocks are identical, a time delay each delay block can provide is also identical. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The measured result forwarding part has the following function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When a voltage provided to the third NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> from the first electrode V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the ferroelectric capacitor is lower than the reference voltage Vref, a current I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to the second NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is greater than a current I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to the third NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Since currents to the first PMOS transistor, and to the second NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are the same, a voltage (Vcc&minus;I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>*R<highlight><subscript>p1</subscript></highlight>, where R<highlight><subscript>p1 </subscript></highlight>denotes a resistance at the first PMOS transistor) at the first node B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lower than a voltage (Vcc&minus;I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>*R<highlight><subscript>p2</subscript></highlight>) at the second node B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (it is assumed that identical sizes of PMOS transistors are used). Accordingly, a voltage to the fifth NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is lower than a voltage to the sixth NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, a voltage at the fifth node B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an output terminal of the sixth NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, is lower than a voltage to the fourth node B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. That is, the output signal is a signal having a voltage dropped from a provided signal to a preset extent due to the two stage of the amplification part. Opposite to this, when the voltage provided to the third NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> from the first electrode V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the ferroelectric capacitor is higher than the reference voltage Vref, the output signal is a signal amplified to a preset extent through the two stage of the amplification part.

The output signal from the measured result forwarding part is fixed according to a signal provided to the negative input terminal of the amplification part.
