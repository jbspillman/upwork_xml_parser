<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A mobile station is configured to measure receiving qualities of respective signals from a first antenna and a second antenna of a base station (S<highlight><bold>3, </bold></highlight>S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), store the results of the measurement, and request the base station to retransmit a signal from an antenna with a higher receiving quality, based on the stored measurement results, when an error is detected in received data thereafter (S<highlight><bold>10, </bold></highlight>S<highlight><bold>11, </bold></highlight>S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The base station retransmits the data, using the antenna with the higher receiving quality (i.e., a base station antenna to yield the higher receiving quality at the mobile station) (S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a conventional mobile communication system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 a</cross-reference> chart for explaining the cooperative operation of the conventional mobile communication system with an automatic repeat request. At a base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) processor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accepts input data addressed to a mobile station <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a data input terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> attaches error-detectable parity such as CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking code) or the like to the data so as to enable detection of an error occurring during transmission, thereafter stores the data (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), and outputs the data to a transmitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> modulates the input data into a transmitted signal and then transmits the signal through a transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and from a first base station antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the mobile station <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a downlink <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives the signal from a mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through a transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Then the signal received at the receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fed as received data to an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> performs detection of error using the CRC (A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When no error is detected in the received data herein, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> outputs the received data from a data output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and outputs an acknowledgement of arrival of the received data to a transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> transmits the acknowledgement of arrival of the received data to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through an uplink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (A<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). Receiving the arrival acknowledgement, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> deletes the data stored for retransmission (A<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When an error is detected in the received data at A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the other hand, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> sends a repeat request for retransmission of the received data to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the uplink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (A<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives an input signal addressed to the mobile station <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through the signal input terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attaches the error-detectable parity such as the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking code) or the like to the data so as to enable detection of an error occurring during transmission, thereafter stores the signal (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and outputs the signal to the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> informs the mobile station of a start of transmission of the signal (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and thereafter transmits the signal to the mobile station <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a downlink <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is a frequency channel determined for transmission of the signal addressed to the mobile station (B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> receives the signal of the downlink <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> received by the mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and thereafter the signal is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> performs the detection of error in the received signal, using the CRC. When no error is detected in the received signal (NO at B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), the received signal is outputted from the signal output terminal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an acknowledgement of arrival of the received signal is transmitted to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the base station through an uplink <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) After that, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receiving the arrival acknowledgement deletes the signal stored for retransmission (NO at B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When an error is detected in the received signal on the other hand (YES at B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> sends a repeat request for retransmission of the received signal to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the base station through the uplink <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Then the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receiving the repeat request retransmits the requested signal in the frequency channel used for the preceding transmission (YES at B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment will describe an example in which a base station is equipped with two base station antennas, but it is noted that the present invention can be substantiated with any number of base station antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> First, the configuration of the mobile communication system will be generally described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the mobile communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is generally comprised of a base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of base station antennas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>; a plurality of transmitted/received wave splitters <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided corresponding to the respective antennas; an antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for switching the transmitted/received wave splitters <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> one from another to use either one; an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> configured to perform various processes including a process of attaching the error-detectable parity such as the CRC or the like to the input data entering a data input terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a process of retransmitting a signal in response to a repeat request from the mobile station, a process of notifying a transmitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of use of an antenna based on an antenna use request, and so on; the transmitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> configured to switch output of the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and transmit data from the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>; and a receiver <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> configured to receive data from the outside through the base station antennas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and feed the data to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> comprises a mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>; a transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; a receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> configured to measure a receiving quality of a received signal for measurement of receiving quality and store the receiving quality in a memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>; a receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> configured to receive a signal from the outside through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> configured to perform the error detection using the CRC for the signal received at the receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and output data from a data output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and also configured to, with detection of an error, output to a transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> notification of a repeat request for retransmission of received data and a number of a base station antenna with a high receiving quality; and a transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> configured to transmit the notification of the repeat request and the number of the base station antenna with the high receiving quality from the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment will be described hereinafter, supposing the receiving quality is a received power. However, as explicitly stated in claim 10, it is also possible to employ as the receiving quality a value obtained by dividing a carrier power by the sum of an interference power and a noise power (i.e., C/(I&plus;N)), a value obtained by dividing a signal power by the sum of an interference power and a noise power (i.e., S/(I&plus;N)), an error rate, a likelihood obtained in decoding of error correction code, a C/N ratio, an S/N ratio, a correlation value obtained by despreading of spreading code, or a combination of two or more out of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The following will describe the operation of the mobile communication system along <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, data addressed to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, entering the data input terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> attaches the error-detectable parity such as the CRC or the like to the data so as to permit detection of an error occurring during transmission, thereafter stores the data, and outputs the data to the transmitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Prior to transmission of a transmitted signal of the input data, the transmitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> switches the output of the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to the first base station antenna and outputs a signal for measurement of receiving quality therefrom. The signal for measurement of receiving quality is transmitted through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and from the first base station antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the signal for measurement of receiving quality is fed through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> measures a received power value of the signal for measurement of receiving quality and stores the received power value as a receiving quality with the use of the first base station antenna in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Next, the output of the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is switched to the second base station antenna and a signal for measurement of receiving quality is outputted. The signal for measurement of receiving quality is transmitted through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and from the second base station antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, in much the same manner as above, the signal for measurement of receiving quality is fed through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to measure a received power value thereof, and the received power value is stored as a receiving quality with the use of the second base station antenna in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the output of the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is switched to the first base station antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the transmitted signal of the data is outputted. The transmitted signal is transmitted through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and from the first base station antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The above described an application of the TDM (Time Division Multiple) system, but it is also possible to apply the CDM (Code Division Multiple) system. In this system, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, signals for measurement of receiving quality are spread by spreading codes uniquely corresponding to the respective antennas and thereafter the signals are transmitted from the corresponding antennas. The mobile station receives the signals, despreads the signals by the spreading codes uniquely corresponding to the antennas to obtain received powers, correlation values, or the like, and can use them as receiving qualities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The following will continue the description back into the application case of the TDM system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the received signal is fed through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Then the signal received at the receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fed as received data into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Then the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> performs the error detection using the CRC. When no error is detected in the received data herein, the received data is outputted from the data output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an acknowledgement of arrival of the data is sent through an uplink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be configured to, on the occasion of receiving notification of an arrival acknowledgement or a repeat request from the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, feed the outputs from the first base station antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the second base station antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into the receiver <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and perform antenna reception in the diversity system of two branches, thereby improving the receiving quality of the uplink. Then the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, receiving the notification of the arrival acknowledgement, deletes the data stored for retransmission (step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> When at step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> an error is detected in the received data on the other hand, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> searches for a number of a base station antenna with the higher receiving quality, i.e., the higher received power value stored in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, and outputs the number of the base station antenna together with a repeat request for retransmission of the received data to the transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> sends the repeat request of the received data and the number of the base station antenna through the uplink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, receiving the notification of the repeat request, first notifies the transmitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the antenna number requested by the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the transmitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> controls the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> so as to be ready for transmission through the use of the antenna to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Then the data under the repeat request is retransmitted from the antenna requested by the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Since the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> stores the number of the antenna requested by the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, it becomes feasible to transmit new data addressed to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, entering the data input terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thereafter, through the use of the base station antenna with the higher receiving quality at the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, without the need for transmitting the aforementioned signals for measurement of receiving quality from the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment as described above, the signal addressed to the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through the use of the antenna with the receiving quality relatively better, based on the receiving qualities of the signals measured at the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and it is thus feasible to improve the receiving quality of the signal at the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, to prevent the repetition of repeat requests from the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and to enhance the throughput of the mobile communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The above described the transmission of the signals for measurement of receiving quality prior to the transmission of data, but the present invention can also be substantiated without the transmission of the signals for measurement of receiving quality prior to the data transmission, as stated in claim 9, by a configuration wherein the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> receives a synchronization signal, a signal of annunciation information, an individual signal to the mobile station, a multicast signal, or a combination of two or more out of these and always updates the contents stored in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment can also be applied to the mobile station functioning as a relay station instead of the base station, supposing the situation of multihop connection. In this case, the mobile station <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of a repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as relay station and requests retransmission of a signal by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). Similarly, the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of the signal according to the repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as a relay station and responds to the repeat request by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Second Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment will describe an example of multicast transmission wherein the base station transmits identical data (which will be referred to as multicast data in the present embodiment) to a plurality of mobile stations and a configuration wherein an automatic repeat request is arranged so that notification of a repeat request is given only when an error is detected. There exist a plurality of mobile stations receiving the multicast data, but the following will describe the operation of only one mobile station out of them. It is a matter of course that like operation is carried out at the other mobile stations being multicast targets omitted to describe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, multicast data addressed to the mobile stations <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, entering the data input terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> stores the multicast data for retransmission in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, thereafter attaches the CRC to the data and performs error-correction code coding thereof, and further attaches information about a number of a base station antenna used for transmission and then outputs the data to the transmitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then the transmitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> controls the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> so as to implement transmission from the antenna indicated by the information on the number of the base station antenna thus attached. The transmitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> modulates the input multicast data into a transmitted signal (multicast signal) and thereafter outputs the signal to the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is configured to be able to transmit the multicast signal through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and from the base station antenna corresponding to the aforementioned number information (either the first base station antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or the second base station antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is controlled so as to be able to transmit the multicast signal, preferentially using a base station antenna with the greatest number of requests from the mobile stations being the multicast targets. Namely, before outputting the multicast data to the transmitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> searches the information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for the information on the number of the base station antenna with the greatest number of requests from the mobile stations, and controls the antenna switching unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> so as to transmit the multicast signal from the base station antenna corresponding to the number. The memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is used for storing correspondences between the numbers of requests from the mobile stations and the numbers of the base station antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> on the other hand, the multicast signal received at the mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the downlink <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fed through the transmitted/received wave splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The receiver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> demodulates the received multicast signal and outputs the demodulated signal as received multicast data to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> performs the decoding of error correction code and thereafter performs the error detection using the attached CRC. At the same time, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> stores a likelihood obtained in the decoding of error correction code, together with the information on the number of the base station antenna attached to the received multicast data, in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. The foregoing likelihood can be the number of corrected bits in the case of the error-correction code coding being the block code such as the BCH code, the RS code, or the like, or a metric in the case of the convolutional code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> When the foregoing error detection with the CRC finds no error in the received multicast data, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> outputs the received multicast data from the data output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, without transmitting any signal to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at all. When an error is detected in the received multicast data on the other hand, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> searches the information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> for the information on the number of the base station antenna with the highest receiving quality and outputs the information on the number of the base station antenna together with a repeat request for retransmission of the received multicast data to the transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> transmits the repeat request of the received multicast data and the information on the number of the base station antenna through the uplink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the receiver <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> receives the repeat request of the received multicast data and the information on the number of the base station antenna and the receiver <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs the data to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as described previously, measures the number of requests for the numbers of the base station antennas requested by the mobile stations, stores the correspondences between the numbers of the base station antennas and the numbers of mobile stations requesting the respective antennas, in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and, on the occasion of retransmitting the multicast data thereafter, retransmits the data, preferentially using the base station antenna with the greatest number of requests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The following will describe the cooperative operation of the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and a plurality of mobile stations (four mobile stations A to D as an example herein) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The configuration of the mobile stations A to D is substantially the same as that of the mobile station <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and they are in an initial state in which no data is stored yet in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> provided in the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and in the memories <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> provided in the respective mobile stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> attaches the number information of the first antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to multicast data, and transmits the multicast data with the number information thus attached, to all the mobile stations (the mobile stations A to D) as multicast targets. For example, let us suppose the mobile stations A to C detect an error in the received multicast data. Then the mobile stations A to C send to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> a repeat request for retransmission of the data and an antenna use request that the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an error rate of which is not stored yet in the memory <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, should be used. Since the mobile station D detects no error in the received multicast data, it transmits nothing to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> then measures the number of requests for the information on the number of each antenna to be used for retransmission, from the mobile stations A to C, and stores the results of the measurement, i.e., information indicating that the number of requests for retransmission from the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is three and that the number of requests for retransmission from the first antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is zero, in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For this reason, based on the foregoing results of the measurement stored in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> transmits the multicast data to be retransmitted (hereinafter referred to as retransmitted multicast data) to the mobile stations A to C from the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the maximum number of requests for retransmission (this step corresponds to &ldquo;first retransmission&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the reception of the first retransmitted multicast data, the mobile stations A to C again detect an error, and then send a repeat request to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. At the mobile station A, an error rate is lower in the reception of the multicast data transmitted from the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the mobile station A sends a use request for use of the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, together with the notification of the repeat request, to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, at the mobile stations B and C, an error rate is lower in the reception of the multicast data transmitted from the first antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and thus they send a use request for use of the first antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, together with the notification of the repeat request, to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> stores information that the number of requests for retransmission from the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is one and the number of requests for retransmission from the first antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is two, in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For this reason, based on the results of the above measurement stored in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> transmits the retransmitted multicast data to the mobile stations A to C from the first antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the maximum number of requests for retransmission (this step corresponds to &ldquo;second retransmission&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The mobile stations B and C detect no error in the reception of the second retransmitted multicast data, and thus they transmit nothing to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the mobile station A detects an error, but it sends no repeat request to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, because the base station antenna used for the transmission is not the antenna requested by the mobile station A. This is because in the next transmission the retransmitted multicast data is expected to be transmitted using the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> requested by the mobile station A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, based on the results of the measurement stored in the memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> transmits the retransmitted multicast data to the mobile station A from the second antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the second highest number of requests for retransmission (this step corresponds to &ldquo;third retransmission&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The mobile station A detects no error in the reception of the third retransmitted multicast data, and thus transmits nothing to the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, thus completing the multicast transmission from the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> By the operation as described above, it becomes feasible to implement the transmission of high-quality signals with the automatic repeat request of the present invention in the transmission of multicast data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment described above, the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> transmits the retransmitted multicast data, using the base station antennas in descending order of the number of antenna use requests based on the receiving qualities of signals measured at the respective mobile stations, and it is thus feasible as a whole of the mobile communication system to improve the receiving qualities of retransmitted multicast data at more mobile stations, to decrease the total number of occurrences of repeat requests, and to enhance the total throughput of the entire system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The above first and second embodiments described the examples in which the mobile station transmitted the antenna use request for use of one antenna out of the plurality of base station antennas, but it is also possible in the case of a number of base station antennas being provided, to employ a configuration wherein the mobile station transmits an antenna use request designating two or more base station antennas with better receiving qualities, as antennas to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, while the present invention can be mentioned as a so-called diversity system wherein one base station uses plural antennas, site diversity is known as a diversity system wherein a plurality of base stations use one antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> This site diversity has the advantage of great diversity gain because of no correlation with shadowing (variation of local median value), but it has the following disadvantages against the fading (instantaneous variation), though demonstrating some great diversity gain because of no correlation therewith: the delay in control time is too large to realize the satisfactory diversity gain because of transmission of control signals between plural base stations; the efficiency is low, because radio resources and devices for the plural base stations are preliminarily occupied for the control in order to adapt to the instantaneous variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> When the present invention is applied in combination with the above site diversity, it can provide the effect of increase in the diversity gain thanks to the use of the plural base stations against the shadowing. Since the control time can be unlimitedly shortened by the feature of the present invention of using plural antennas in one base station, satisfactorily large diversity gain can be realized against the fading. By applying the site diversity to the present invention as described, it is feasible to attain the maximum diversity gain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment can also be applied to the mobile station functioning as a relay station instead of the base station, supposing the situation of multihop connection. In this case, the mobile station <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of a repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as relay station and requests retransmission of a signal by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). Similarly, the base station <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of the signal according to the repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as a relay station and responds to the repeat request by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Third Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The present embodiment will describe an example in which the base station transmits the signal to the mobile station in the multiband transmission system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the mobile communication system in the present embodiment, which is generally comprised of a base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and a mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. The base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> comprises an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, a signal input terminal <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a base station antenna <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, and a channel determiner <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> comprises a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, a signal output terminal <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, a receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The following will describe the operation with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a signal addressed to the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, entering the signal input terminal <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> attaches the error-detectable parity such as the CRC or the like to the signal so as to permit the detection of an error occurring during transmission, thereafter stores the signal for retransmission (T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and outputs the signal to the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> informs the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of a transmission start of the signal addressed to the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and a number of a frequency channel in a frequency band for transmission of the signal (T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and thereafter transmits the signal to the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> If candidates are preliminarily known for the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band for transmission of the signal, it is also possible to omit the informing step of the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, at the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> continuously, constantly measures C/I (Carrier-to-Interfere ratio: carrier power to interference power ratio) of individual channels transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, as receiving qualities (Ti), and stores relations between numbers of frequency channels in frequency bands measured, and C/I&apos;s of the frequency channels in the memory <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As described above, the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> continuously, constantly measures the C/I&apos;s of individual channels or the like transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the relations are always updated between numbers of frequency channels in frequency bands, and C/I&apos;s of the frequency channels in the memory <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> in this configuration, the signal addressed to the mobile station, transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, is received through the downlink <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> by the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), and thereafter the signal is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> performs the error detection of the received signal using the CRC. When no error is detected in the received signal (NO at T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> outputs the received signal from the signal output terminal <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and also sends an acknowledgement of arrival of the received signal through the uplink <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Then the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, receiving the notification of the arrival acknowledgement from each mobile station, deletes the signal addressed to the mobile station, stored for retransmission (T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). In this respect, it is also possible to employ a configuration without the notification of the arrival acknowledgement (T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), wherein the process of detecting the repeat request (T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) is provided with a time-out judging function and the operation of T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is carried out when no repeat request is detected within a certain period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> When at T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> an error is detected in the received signal (YES at T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) on the other hand, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> sends a repeat request for retransmission of the received signal through the uplink <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and also sends to the channel determiner <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> a number of a frequency channel in a frequency band with the maximum C/I out of those measured and stored in the memory <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, and the C/I of the frequency channel (T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> When the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> receives the repeat request, it is determined at T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> whether the input signal is a repeat request. When a repeat request is detected at the determination of T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (YES at T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the channel determiner <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is notified of the result of the detection. Receiving the notification of the detection of the repeat request from the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the channel determiner <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> calculates such a transmission power that the receiving quality at the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> becomes a required value, based on the C/I thus notified of (T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), and then controls the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> so that the signal under the repeat request is retransmitted by the frequency channel number notified of and the transmission power calculated. Then the signal retransmitted from the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is fed into the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> informs the mobile station of the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band used for retransmission (T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and thereafter transmits the retransmitted signal thereto (T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> also transmits a new signal addressed to the mobile station, entering the signal input terminal <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> thereafter, by using the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band and the transmission power acquired in the above operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> When candidates are known in advance for the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band used for retransmission, the base station omits the informing step of the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band used for retransmission and the mobile station receives the retransmitted signal by the use of the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band with the maximum receiving quality out of the candidates for the number of the frequency channel in the frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present embodiment showed the example using the multiband transmission system as an example of the transmission system between the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and besides, it is also possible to use the FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) transmission system, the multicarrier transmission system, or the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) transmission system as a transmission system between the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. For example, the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is notified of a number of a frequency channel and a receiving quality of the frequency channel in the case of the FDM transmission system being used; of a number of a subcarrier channel and a receiving quality of the subcarrier channel in the case of the multicarrier transmission system being used; or of a number of an orthogonal subcarrier channel and a receiving quality of the orthogonal subcarrier channel in the case of the OFDM transmission system being used, whereby the receiving quality at the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> can be improved by the operation similar to that in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> According to the third embodiment of the present invention, as described above, the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> calculates the transmission power to achieve the required receiving quality at the mobile station, based on the number of the frequency channel and the C/I of the frequency channel notified of by the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and retransmits the signal under the repeat request from the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, using the number of the frequency channel notified of and the transmission power thus calculated, whereby the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being kept in the low receiving quality state because of fading or shadowing. As a consequence, the repetition of repeat requests from the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> can be reduced, so as to enhance the throughput. Since the retransmission of the retransmitted signal is carried out after changeover into the frequency channel with the minimum transmission power from the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, interference can be reduced with mobile stations <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> not receiving the retransmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment can also be applied to the mobile station functioning as a relay station instead of the base station, supposing the situation of multihop connection. In this case, the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of a repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as relay station and requests retransmission of a signal by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). Similarly, the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of the signal according to the repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as a relay station and responds to the repeat request by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment will describe an example in which the base station transmits a multicast signal to each mobile station in the FDM transmission system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the mobile communication system in the fourth embodiment, which is generally comprised of a base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, as in the third embodiment described above. The base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> comprises an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, a signal input terminal <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, a base station antenna <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, and a channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> comprises a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, a signal output terminal <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, a mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, a receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The following will describe the operation of the mobile communication system in the present embodiment with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. There exist a plurality of mobile stations in a group receiving one multicast signal, but only one mobile station in the group will be described below as a typical example. The other mobile stations belonging to the group also perform the operation similar to that of the mobile station described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, a multicast signal addressed to the mobile stations <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, entering the signal input terminal <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> attaches the error-detectable parity such as the CRC or the like to the signal so as to permit the detection of an error occurring during transmission, thereafter stores the multicast signal for retransmission (T<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), and outputs the signal to the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. The transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> informs each mobile station of a start of transmission of the multicast signal and a number of a frequency channel for transmission of the multicast signal, and thereafter transmits the multicast signal to the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> When candidates are known in advance for the number of the frequency channel used for transmission of the multicast signal, it is also possible to omit the informing step of the frequency channel number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, at the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> continuously, constantly measures C/I of an individual channel or the like transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> as a receiving quality (T<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>), and stores the relation between the number of the frequency channel and the C/I of the frequency channel thus measured, in the memory <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> As described above, the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> continuously, constantly measures the C/I&apos;s of the individual channels or the like transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the relations are always updated between the numbers of the frequency channels, and the C/I&apos;s of the frequency channels in the memory <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment will be described hereinafter, supposing the receiving quality is C/I. It is, however, also possible to use as the receiving quality a received power, C/(I&plus;N), S/(I&plus;N), C/N, S/N, an error rate, a likelihood obtained in decoding of error correction code, a base station transmission power value, an amount of increase or attenuation of the base station transmission power, or a combination of these. The character &ldquo;C&rdquo; in C/(I&plus;N) above represents the carrier power, and &ldquo;S&rdquo; in S/(I&plus;N) above the signal power. Further, the character &ldquo;I&rdquo; in above C/(I&plus;N) and above S/(I&plus;N) represents the interference power, and &ldquo;N&rdquo; the noise power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, as described, it is possible to use any signal for the measurement of receiving quality as long as it is a signal transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> configured to transmit the multicast signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, the multicast signal transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is received through the downlink <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> at the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) and thereafter is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> performs the error detection of the received multicast signal using the CRC. When no error is detected in the received multicast signal (NO at T<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>), the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> outputs the received multicast signal from the signal output terminal <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and sends an acknowledgement of arrival of the received multicast signal to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> through the uplink <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, receiving only the notification of the arrival acknowledgement from each mobile station, deletes the multicast signal stored for retransmission (NO at T<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and T<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). In this respect, it is also possible to employ a configuration without the foregoing notification of the arrival acknowledgement (T<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>), wherein the process of detecting the repeat request (T<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) is provided with a time-out judging function and the operation of (T<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) is executed when no repeat request is detected within a certain period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> When an error is detected in the received multicast signal on the other hand (YES at T<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>), the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> sends a repeat request for retransmission of the received multicast signal through the uplink <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> also makes access to the memory <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> and notifies the channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, of the latest frequency channel number and the C/I of the frequency channel measured and stored in the memory <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> (T<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> When the repeat request is fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, it is determined at (T<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) whether the input signal is a repeat request. When a repeat request is detected at the determination of T<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (YES at T<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>), the channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is notified of the result of the detection. When the channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> receives the notification that the repeat request is detected by the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, it determines a number of a frequency channel for retransmission and a transmission power of the frequency channel on the basis of the frequency channel number and the C/I of the frequency channel notified of by each mobile station (T<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>), and thereafter controls the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> so as to retransmit the signal by the use of the frequency channel number and the transmission power thus determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Then the multicast signal stored for retransmission at the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is fed into the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> informs the mobile station of numbers of frequency channels or a number of a single frequency channel used for retransmission (T<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) and thereafter transmits the input retransmitted multicast signal (T<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Each mobile station to receive the retransmitted multicast signal, receives the retransmitted multicast signal in a channel of a frequency channel number with the maximum receiving quality at the mobile station out of the frequency numbers thus informed of. When candidates are known in advance for the numbers of the frequency channels or the number of the single frequency channel used for retransmission, the informing step of the frequency channel number for retransmission of the multicast signal is omitted, and each mobile station receives the retransmitted multicast signal in a channel of a frequency channel number with the maximum receiving quality out of the candidates for the frequency channel numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> can also transmit a new multicast signal entering the signal input terminal <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> in processing thereafter, using the numbers of the frequency channels or the number of the single frequency channel and the transmission power determined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> As described above, the fourth embodiment described the case using the FDM transmission system as an example of the transmission system between the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, and besides, it is also possible to use the multicarrier transmission system, the OFDM transmission system, or the multiband transmission system as a transmission system between the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. For example, the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is notified of a number of a subcarrier channel and a receiving quality of the subcarrier channel in the case of the multicarrier transmission system being used; of a number of an orthogonal subcarrier channel and a receiving quality of the orthogonal subcarrier channel in the case of the OFDM transmission system being used; or of a number of a frequency channel in a frequency band and a receiving quality of the frequency channel in the frequency band in the case of the multiband transmission system being used, whereby the receiving quality at the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> can be improved by the operation similar to that of the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, as described above, the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> determines the frequency channel number for retransmission of the multicast signal and the transmission power of the frequency channel on the basis of the frequency channel number and the C/I of the frequency channel notified of by each mobile station and thereafter retransmits the signal by the frequency channel number and transmission power thus determined. Therefore, the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> can receive the retransmitted multicast signal with the required receiving quality even in a state under the influence of fading or shadowing. As a consequence, the repetition of repeat requests from the mobile station <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is reduced, so as to enhance the throughput. The interference can be reduced with mobile stations not receiving the retransmitted multicast signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The following will describe an example of the procedure of determining the number of the frequency channel in the radio channel and the transmission power on the assumption of the mobile communication system in the present embodiment and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The determination of the frequency channel number and the transmission power is done at the channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the base station. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a flowchart (algorithm) showing the processing procedure of determining the frequency channel number and the transmission power. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an example of receiving qualities of respective frequency channels at each of mobile stations <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> For convenience of explanation, the following will describe an example in which the number of frequency channels available is three (f&equals;0, 1, or 2). Since it is possible to select an arbitrary number of frequency channels up to three, there are seven combinations (c&equals;0-6) of frequencies accordingly. The following description will be given on the presumption that the channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is already notified of the receiving qualities of the respective frequency channels at each of the mobile stations. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the channel determiner <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is assumed to be notified of the receiving qualities at the respective mobile stations <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a graph showing an example in which each mobile station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is monitoring the receiving qualities of signals of the first to third frequency channels transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, as described previously. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the horizontal axis represents the frequency (f) and the vertical axis the receiving quality (dB). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, for example, the mobile station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in a state in which the receiving quality of the first frequency channel (f&equals;0) is 0 dB, the receiving quality of the second frequency channel (f&equals;1) &minus;1 dB, and the receiving quality of the third frequency channel (f&equals;2) &minus;15 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the mobile station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in a state in which the receiving quality of the first frequency channel (f&equals;0) is &minus;20 dB, the receiving quality of the second frequency channel (f&equals;1) 0 dB, and the receiving quality of the third frequency channel (f&equals;2) &minus;10 dB. The mobile station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is in a state in which the receiving quality of the first frequency channel (f&equals;0) is &minus;15 dB, the receiving quality of the second frequency channel (f&equals;1) &minus;20 dB, and the receiving quality of the third frequency channel (f&equals;2) 0 dB. In the present example, the required receiving quality (Qreq) at each mobile station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assumed to be 0 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> As a premise of describing the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> herein, the following presents correspondence relations between the combinations of frequency channels f assumed to be used for retransmission, and c representing classes of the combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> c&equals;0: f&equals;0 (the first frequency channel being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> c&equals;1: f&equals;1 (the second frequency channel being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> c&equals;2: f&equals;2 (the third frequency channel being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> c&equals;3: f&equals;0, 1 (the first and second frequency channels being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> c&equals;4: f&equals;1, 2 (the second and third frequency channels being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> c&equals;5: f&equals;0, 2 (the first and third frequency channels being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> c&equals;6: f&equals;0, 1, 2 (the first, second, and third frequency channels being used) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the first step is to assume c&equals;0, i.e., that only the first frequency channel is used, and set the mobile station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (i&equals;0) as a mobile station (T<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>). Then calculation of (T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is executed. At T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, MAX&lcub;q(i,f)&rcub; is calculated. Here q(i,f) indicates the receiving quality of the frequency channel f at the mobile station i. Further, MAX&lcub;q(i,f)&rcub; indicates maximum q(i,f) among all the frequency channels f in the combination class c of the frequency channels at the mobile station i. In the present example, at i&equals;0, the maximum receiving frequency in the case of c&equals;0 is given at f&equals;0, and thus the calculation is done as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>(0,0)&equals;<highlight><italic>q</italic></highlight>(0,0)&equals;0 dB</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> (reference is made to 1 in a circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> After q(0,0) is acquired in this way, the flow proceeds to next (T<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) to increment i by &ldquo;1&rdquo; (i&equals;1, the mobile station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). At this (T<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>), the modulo arithmetic is carried out, and thus i is incremented until a remainder in division of (i&plus;1) by number of all mobile stations sending a re becomes zero. Therefore, 1 mod 3(&equals;M) at this which results in i&ne;0. Thus the determination at T<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is NO, so that the processing from T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is carried out again. This means that the processing of T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is repeatedly carried out until i becomes equal to M (before i&equals;3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, since the determination at T<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is NO, the flow returns to T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to execute the calculation of MAX&lcub;q(i,f)&rcub; for the mobile station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (i&equals;1). Then the result below is obtained (reference is made to 2 in a circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>).</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Further, the calculation for i&equals;2 (mobile station 3) is also carried out in much the same manner as the above procedure, and the following result is obtained.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>(2,0)&equals;MAX&lcub;<highlight><italic>q</italic></highlight>(2,0)&rcub;&equals;&minus;15 dB</in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> After T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is executed in this way (c&equals;0) for all the mobile stations (i&equals;0-2), the determination at T<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> results in i&equals;0 (YES at T<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>), and then the flow proceeds to next T<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> At this T<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, P(c)&equals;&Sgr;&lcub;(Qreq&minus;MIN(Q(i,f))&rcub; is calculated as follows. In this equation, Qreq represents the required receiving quality, and P(c) the transmission power from the base station in the case of the combination class of frequency channels being c. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> In the case of c&equals;0, the calculation is carried out as follows.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>P</italic></highlight>(0)&equals;<highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>req&minus;MIN&lcub;<highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>(0,0), <highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>(1,0), <highlight><italic>Q</italic></highlight>(2,0)&rcub;</in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&equals;&plus;20 dB</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, for c&equals;0, the calculation results in P(0)&equals;&plus;20 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> After completion of the calculation of P(c) in the case of c&equals;0 in this way, the flow proceeds to next T<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to increment the combination class c of frequency channels. At this point, c becomes 1 mod 6 (Nc) and thus c&ne;0, leading to NO as the result of the determination at (T<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). Thus the processing from (T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is executed again. Namely, the processing of T<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is repeatedly carried out until c becomes equal to Nc (before c&equals;6 in the present example). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The following presents the results of the calculations of Q(i,f) and P(c) executed in much the same manner as the above-stated procedure, for c&equals;1 to c&equals;6. </paragraph>

Similarly, the base station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of the signal according to the repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as a relay station and responds to the repeat request by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Lastly, the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. The present embodiment employs the NACK base automatic repeat request not to send an arrival acknowledgement but to send only a repeat request, and the base station is configured to receive multicast signals of packet units and send them in the multicarrier transmission system. The following will describe an example of combination with a method using spreading codes for repeat requests and thereby permitting detection of repeat requests and numbers of packets under the repeat request even with occurrence of collision between repeat request signals at the base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The method capable of detecting the repeat requests even with occurrence of collision between repeat requests is disclosed in International Patent Application (PCT/JP01/02923). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the mobile communication system in the present embodiment, which is generally comprised of a base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and a mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, as in the first embodiment and the second embodiment described above. The base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> comprises an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, a signal input terminal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, a base station antenna <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, a channel determiner <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, and a repeat request signal quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. The mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> comprises a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, an ARQ processor <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>, a signal output terminal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, a mobile station antenna <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, a receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> At the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, packets of a multicast signal entering the signal input terminal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are fed into the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> attaches the CRC to the input packets and outputs them to the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> informs each mobile station of a start of transmission of the packets and a number of a subcarrier used for the transmission of the packets and thereafter transmits the packets through the downlink <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, at the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> continuously, constantly measures as the receiving quality, S/(N&plus;I) of each subcarrier transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and stores the correlation between the subcarrier number and S/(N&plus;I) of the subcarrier thus measured, in the memory <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> At the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> in this configuration, the packets transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> are received through the downlink <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> by the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and thereafter are outputted to the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>. The ARQ processor <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> performs the error detection of the received packets using the CRC. When no error is detected in the received packets, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> outputs the packets from the signal output terminal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Since the NACK base automatic repeat request is employed, no arrival acknowledgement is sent to the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> when no error is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> When an error is detected in the received packets, the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> notifies the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> through the uplink <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> of a repeat request for retransmission of a requested packet and the subcarrier number with the maximum receiving quality stored in the memory <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment will describe an example of a method of selecting a channel number with a receiving quality within a certain range as a subcarrier number with the maximum receiving quality at each mobile station and notifying the base station of only the subcarrier thereafter. Spreading codes are used for packet numbers under repeat requests and numbers of subcarriers used for transmission of retransmitted packets. For example, in the case where 256 spreading codes are available, 128 spreading codes can be allocated to identification of packet numbers, and 128 spreading codes to identification of subcarrier numbers. Namely, in this case, a number of a spreading code transmitted from the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> to the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> can be determined by the following calculation.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Number of spreading code&equals;(packet number)&plus;(subcarrier number)&times;16</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case where the retransmitted packet number is &ldquo;8&rdquo; and the subcarrier number for the repeat request of the retransmitted packet is &ldquo;3,&rdquo; 8&plus;3&times;16&equals;56, and thus the mobile station transmits the fifty sixth spreading code as a repeat request signal. This makes a judgment on a repeat request feasible using a correlation value by the spreading code or a level of a signal obtained by the despreading operation as a receiving quality even if collision occurs between repeat request signals at the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> can detect the repeat request for retransmission of the eighth packet through the use of the third subcarrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> For the spreading code transmitted from the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, the repeat request signal quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> detects the retransmitted packet number and subcarrier number. The repeat request signal quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> notifies the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the retransmitted packet signal detected and notifies the channel determiner <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> of the subcarrier number requested to use in retransmission. Then the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> searches for a packet number with the largest number of repeat requests and thereafter controls the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> so as to retransmit the packet by the subcarrier number thus searched for. The transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> informs the mobile station of the retransmission using the subcarrier number and thereafter transmits the retransmitted packet fed from the ARQ processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, using the subcarrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> As described above, the receiving quality at the mobile station can be improved by the configuration and operation of the mobile communication system in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> According to the mobile communication system in the present embodiment, the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> receives from the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> the repeat request signal assigned by the spreading code and thus, even with occurrence of collision between repeat request signals at the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> can detect each repeat request for retransmission of which packet using which subcarrier, by determining the correlation value of the spreading code. Since the packet with the greatest number of repeat requests is retransmitted using the subcarrier with the greatest number of requests (the subcarrier with the maximum receiving quality), the mobile station can receive the packet with the required receiving quality under the repeat request. As a consequence, the repetition of repeat requests from the mobile station can be reduced, so as to enhance the throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment can also be applied to the mobile station functioning as a relay station instead of the base station, supposing the situation of multihop connection. In this case, the mobile station <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of a repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as relay station and requests retransmission of a signal by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). Similarly, the base station <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, which is a transmitting station of the signal according to the repeat request, preliminarily identifies existence of an adjoining mobile station as a relay station and responds to the repeat request by designating a transmission path including the mobile station (relay station). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> In each of the above embodiments, the receiving quality measuring function of the receiving quality measuring unit <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> in the mobile station <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> corresponds to the receiving quality measuring means, and the receiving quality transmitting function of the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to the receiving quality notifying means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> The transmitting function of the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> in the base station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> corresponds to the transmitting means; the channel determining function of the channel determiner <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> corresponds to the radio channel determining means and to the first, second, and third channel number determining means. Further, the transmission power calculating function of the channel determiner <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> corresponds to the first and second radio channel transmission power determining means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the embodiments of the invention may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended for inclusion within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
