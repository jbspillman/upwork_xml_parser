<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a microwave oven, and more particularly, to a device and method for inputting recipe data in a microwave oven by which the recipe data such as names and contents of recipes for the microwave oven desired by a user can be stored so that cooking can be simply made upon repetitive cooking of dishes corresponding to the recipe data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a microwave oven is a cooking machine for cooking foodstuffs by causing microwaves outputted from a magnetron to penetrate into the foodstuffs. When a user utilizes such a microwave oven, the user selects a dish menu and a cooking period of time by manipulating keys provided in a key input section of the microwave oven and presses a cooking start key. Then, the magnetron is driven according to the dish menu inputted by the user so as to perform a cooking process by irradiating the high-frequency microwaves into a cooking chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, when the user selects a grill function or convection function, a heater of the microwave oven is driven. The heat generated from the heater is forcedly circulated by an interior cooling fan and thus the foodstuffs can be cooked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During such a cooking period of time in which the foodstuffs are cooked, a message of elapse of the cooking period of time or a remaining cooking period of time is displayed on a recipe screen of a display unit of the microwave oven. When the cooking period of time according to the selected dish menu is lapsed, the message of the cooking completion is displayed on the screen of the display unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Such a conventional microwave oven will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view showing a configuration for controlling a display screen of the conventional microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> First, the constitution of the conventional microwave oven will be described. The conventional microwave oven comprises a microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which programs for operating the microwave oven are installed, an oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for supplying the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with reference clock pulses so that the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can execute the programs, and a power circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for supplying electric power to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The conventional microwave oven further comprises a key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for allowing the user to input functions of the microwave oven the user wants, a display unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for notifying the user to confirm contents inputted from the key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an operation state of the microwave oven, and a relay control unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for allowing the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to operate the microwave oven in response to the contents inputted from the key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method for controlling the display screen of the conventional microwave oven constructed as such will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the display screen for allowing the user to set a &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; of the conventional microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The user selects the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe,&rdquo; which is displayed on a display screen as shown in a block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to newly perform an arbitrary dish menu rather than dish menus that have been beforehand set in the microwave oven. A signal generated from a key selected by the user is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls a control signal, which corresponds to the function selected by the user, to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The display unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> displays a screen for setting a cooking period of time and cooking power, as shown in a block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in response to the control signal of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the user can set the cooking period of time and the cooking power for the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; selected by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> At this time, the latest data set by the user are displayed on the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; display screen. The data displayed on the display screen can be set again by changing the cooking period of time and the cooking power through selection of a change key by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the user selects the change key, a screen for allowing the user to newly input data is displayed. Accordingly, while viewing the display screen, the user can arbitrarily set the cooking period of time and the cooking power through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a display screen shown in a block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> After the cooking period of time is set in such a way, a start key provided in the key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressed on a display screen shown in a block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When the user presses the start key, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives a signal corresponding to the start key from the key input circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, controls the signal, and outputs control signals to the relay control unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the display unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Thus, the microwave oven is driven for the newly set cooking period of time in accordance with the newly set recipe data. Then, the display unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the microwave oven informs the user that the cooking in the microwave oven is in progress by displaying a screen shown in a block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> on the display unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, there are several problems in the method for inputting new recipe data in the conventional microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> First, a new and arbitrary dish menu which the user has already set in the microwave oven was not stored therein. Therefore, there is an inconvenience in that the user should input the cooking period of time again whenever the same menu as beforehand set by the user is cooked. As a result, it is difficult to provide the user with the convenience of use of the microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the user does not remember the new and arbitrary dish menu that has been beforehand inputted by the user, there is a problem in that the user cannot correctly perform the recipe by using the microwave oven. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the user wants to perform cooking in the microwave oven, the user first selects a desired recipe in an initial screen of the microwave oven through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). Here, the recipes of the microwave oven are categorized into a &ldquo;manual cooking,&rdquo; an &ldquo;automatic cooking&rdquo; and a &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe.&rdquo; The phrases of &ldquo;manual cooking,&rdquo; &ldquo;automatic cooking,&rdquo; and &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; are displayed on the screen of the display unit of the microwave oven as shown in a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the screen displayed in such a way, the user inputs the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the microwave oven <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in order to set a new recipe menu. Accordingly, a signal corresponding to the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; selected by the user is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the microwave oven, and the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then controls a control signal in response to the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; signal to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> displays recipe menus related to the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; on the next screen in response to the control signal of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). That is, as shown in a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the recipe menus of the &ldquo;user&apos;s recipe&rdquo; include menus that have been previously set, and an &ldquo;addition of new menu&rdquo; menu through which the user can set a new menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Then, if the user wants to newly set an arbitrary menu, the user can select an &ldquo;addition of new menu&rdquo; key (step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). In step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a signal corresponding to the key selected by the user is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controls a control signal in response to the signal inputted by the user to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the microwave oven (step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As a result, the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides the user with a user&apos;s setting screen as shown in a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in response to the control signal of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that the user can set data on a new recipe menu (step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The user&apos;s setting screen (shown in the block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is comprised of a screen for allowing the user to set a cooking period of time and cooking power. The user confirms the user&apos;s setting screen and then sets the cooking period of time and the cooking power for the recipe menu to be newly added by selecting numerical keys of the key input key <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The data on the cooking period of time and the cooking power set by the user in step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which in turn transmits the data to the recipe storage unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Then, the data on the cooking period of time and the cooking power for the new recipe menu set by the user are stored in the recipe storage unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the data on the cooking period of time and the cooking power are stored in the recipe storage unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> outputs a control signal to the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the user can newly set a recipe name for the recipe menu. Accordingly, the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides the user with a recipe name input screen as shown in a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> by which the user can input a new recipe name for the recipe menu (step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The user checks the recipe name input screen and then sets the recipe name for the recipe menu by combining consonants and vowels, or alphabets provided in the key input circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>). When the user completes the setting of the recipe name for the recipe menu, the user selects a setting completion key of the key input circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to complete the setting of the new recipe name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the user presses the setting completion key, a signal corresponding to the setting completion key is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines whether the user completes the setting of the new recipe menu and selects the setting completion key of the key input circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, if it is determined that the user has selected the setting completion key, data on the recipe name for the recipe menu set by the user are outputted to the recipe name storage unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Then, the data on the recipe name for the recipe menu received from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are stored in the recipe name storage unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The recipe name additionally stored in such a control operation (&ldquo;brown-seaweed soup&rdquo; in this embodiment of the present invention) is simultaneously displayed together with the other recipe menus on the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown in a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. If the user selects the newly added recipe menu through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in such a displayed state, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> recognizes a signal corresponding to the selection. Then, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controls the microwave oven so that the data on the newly added recipe menu are displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as shown in a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and at the same time, the cooking starts to be performed. </paragraph>
