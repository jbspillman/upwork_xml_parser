<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of The Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a consumable-supplies purchase order method, a consumable-supplies purchase order system, a customer equipment and a purchase order processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of The Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the supplementing of consumable supplies to customer equipment is performed each time the necessity of the customer equipment takes place, while the customer is required to grasp the current situations of the consumable supplies in the customer equipment. For example, when toner runs short in the customer equipment, such as a copier and a printer, the customer gives by telephone or facsimile a purchase order for the toner to a predetermined supply center. Moreover, the delivery of only a fixed quantity of consumable supplies to the customer is also periodically performed according to the contract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, when the above method of placing a purchase order for consumable supplies to the supply center each time the necessity arises, while the customer himself grasps the situation of the consumable supplies is used, there is a problem that the customer is unaware of the necessity of supplementing the consumable supplies until the consumable supplies in the customer equipment are lost completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the customer worries about the unawareness of the necessity of supplementing the consumable supplies or wishes to reduce a complicated purchase ordering of the consumable supplies, the placement of a purchase order for a large quantity of the consumable supplies is performed beforehand. Consequently, a problem that the customer has to hold useless stock of consumable supplies will arise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the delivery of only a fixed quantity of the consumable supplies to the customer is performed according to the contract, then the problem that the consumable supplies run short soon arises. To avoid this problem, if the delivery of a large quantity of the consumable supplies to the customer is performed periodically by the contract, the problem that the customer has to hold the useless stock of the consumable supplies will arise. </paragraph>
