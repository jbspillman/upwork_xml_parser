<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a thread breakage detection device for sewing machines, and more specifically to a thread breakage detection device including a permanent magnet member and a hole element provided to a stitch balancing thread tension having a rotary disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have been provided sewing machines for industrial use capable of stitching multicolor embroidery patterns. One type of such sewing machines includes a needle-bar casing that houses a plurality of needle bars each mounting a needle at its lower end. During embroidery operation, the needle-bar casing is moved right and left to select one of the needles to use. A plurality of thread spools for supplying needle threads are provided on a thread spool stand that is fixed behind the needle-bar casing. A frame, to which a plurality of thread breakage detection sensors and a plurality of stitch balancing thread tensions are attached, is formed to an upper part of the needle-bar casing. The needle threads from the thread spools are supplied to the corresponding needles via the corresponding thread breakage detection sensors and stitch balancing thread tensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each thread breakage detection sensor includes, for example, a shaft that rotates in association with the supply of the needle thread, a photo-interrupter supported on the frame, and an encode disk formed with a plurality of slots. The encode disk is fixed to and integrally rotatable with the shaft, and detects thread breakage based on detection signals from the photo-interrupter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the above conventional configuration requires an increased number of components because of the thread breakage detection sensor provided to the frame, whereby the manufacturing costs of the sewing machine are increased, and the overall configuration becomes complex. This problem is particularly striking in a multi-needle sewing machine for industrial use where a plurality of needles are provided since in this case a plurality of thread breakage detection sensors are required. Also, dust raised during embroidery operation often causes detection error. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above problems, and also to provide a thread breakage detection device that can be used in a sewing machine without increasing the number of components, the manufacturing costs, or the size of the sewing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a thread breakage detection device used in a stitch balancing thread tension having a shaft and a rotary disk having a surface extending perpendicular to an axial direction of the shaft and rotating in accordance with a supply of a thread. The thread breakage detection device including a permanent magnet member attached to the surface of the rotary disk and generating a magnetic field, a hole element that detects the magnetic field generated in the permanent magnet member and outputs a detection signal based on the detected magnetic field, and a detection unit that detects a thread breakage of the thread based on the detection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is also provided a stitch balancing thread tension including a stationary member, a shaft relatively rotatable with respect to the stationary member, a rotary disk that applies a tension to a thread, the rotary disk being mounted on the shaft and having a surface that extends perpendicular to an axial direction of the shaft, a permanent magnet member attached to the surface of the rotary disk, and a hole element mounted on the stationary member, the hole element detecting a magnetic field generated in the permanent magnet member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, there is provided a sewing machine including a stationary member, a shaft, a rotary disk, a permanent magnet member, a hole element, a measuring unit, a counting unit, and a detector. The shaft is relatively rotatable with respect to the stationary member. The rotary disk applies a tension to a thread. The rotary disk is mounted on the shaft and has a surface that extends perpendicular to an axial direction of the shaft. The permanent magnet member is attached to the surface of the rotary disk. The hole element mounted on the stationary member, detects a magnetic field generated in the permanent magnet member, and outputs a detection signal based on the detected magnetic field. The measuring unit measures a time duration during an embroidery operation. The counting unit counts a number of times the detection signal changes. The detector detects a thread breakage of the thread when the counting unit does not count a predetermined number within a predetermined time duration during the embroidery operation.</paragraph>

A bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is extending from a bobbin (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be provided for the stitch balancing thread tensions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Because the stitch balancing thread tensions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have the same configuration as the stitch balancing thread tensions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, only the stitch balancing thread tensions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, each stitch balancing thread tension <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a regulation unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a thread take-up spring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the like. The body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made of metal and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, has a flange <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed with a hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in an elongated round shape. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed to the frame <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> inserted through the hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this configuration, the relative position of the stitch balancing thread tension <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the frame <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be controlled by moving the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with respect to the screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed of a small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a large-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a medium-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and a small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, arranged in this order from the rear side to have a stepped configuration. The small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the large-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are housed inside the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the thread take-up spring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> mounted on the outer periphery of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is tightly engaged to an engaging hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed in the rear portion of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is fixed to the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A ground locking screw <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is also provided to the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed with an expanding slot <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from a tip end of the medium-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>across the entire length of the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in its axial direction. A thin-plate member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, a circular felt member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a circular felt member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are mounted on an outer periphery of a base end of the medium-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The thin-plate member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the circular felt member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and the circular felt member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are integrally rotatable. Here, a user can, after loosing the screw <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, rotate the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> around its axis using a flat head driver inserted into the expanding slot <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In this manner, the user can adjust the urging force of the thread take-up spring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The regulation unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is for regulating the rotation resistance of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and includes a tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a turning dial <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a helical compression spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a circular spring bearing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed of a compound resin to a sleeve shape with a front side open, and is mounted on the periphery of a rear half portion of the medium-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>such that the tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is movable in the axial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A rear side of the tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contacts and applies relatively small pressing force to the circular felt members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which are for applying the rotation resistance to the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The turning dial <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed of a compound resin to a tapered sleeve shape with its rear side open, which is engaged inside the tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> Inside a front half portion of the turning dial <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with a sleeve portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>whose inner periphery defines a female screw that engages a male screw <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed to an outer periphery of the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The spring bearing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is housed inside the turning dial <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and mounted on the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>so as to be movable in the axial direction. The helical compression spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provided between a flange <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed to the, front end of the spring bearing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> urges the flange <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to contact the sleeve portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and urges the tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to press the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, when a user rotates the turning dial <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with his fingers, the spring bearing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> moves forward and backward in the axial direction, thereby changing the urging force of the helical compression spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> applied onto the tension disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the rotation resistance of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Here, the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed of a pair of thin metal disks engaged each other back to back to define on its outer periphery a thread guide groove <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> having a V-shaped cross section. The needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is wound around the thread guide groove <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to make a single complete circle. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed of a plurality of through holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>aligned equidistance from each other along the outer periphery for preventing slippage between the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> wound therearound. In this configuration, the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> rotates as the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supplied to the needles <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during embroidery operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The sewing machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also includes a thread breakage detection unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The thread breakage detection unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> detects thread breakage of the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and includes a permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a control device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the rear surface of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by sintering (pore into a casing and sinter) so that the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rotates integrally with the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> when the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supplied. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a rear surface of the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> opposite to a front surface fixed to the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed of sintered metal to have a ring shape with a thickness of 2 mm to 3 mm and a diameter that is approximately the half of the diameter of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> plurality of north poles and a plurality of south poles are arranged in the rear surface of the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in alternation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted on a rectangular-shaped substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is attached to the front surface of the flange <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by an adhesive. The hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is positioned close to the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and facing one of the north poles and the south poles of the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed with a through hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>through which a lead wire <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extends from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the control device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the magnetic field generated at the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a direction parallel to the thickness direction of the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, i.e., to the axial direction of the stitch balancing thread tension <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and selectively reaches to the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> rotates, a pole that confronts the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> switches from a north pole to a south pole and vice versa, so that the direction of the magnetic field projected to the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is reversed in short period of time. As a result, a sinusoidal wave signal is generated in the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and output as a detection signal to the control device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> via the lead wire <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shapes this sinusoidal wave signal and then converts into a rectangular pulse signal having a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, wherein the pulse signal of &ldquo;0&rdquo; indicates the magnetic field with a forward direction, for example, and the pulse signal of &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates the magnetic field with a reversing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is broken during the operation, supply of the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the thread spool <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> completely stops, and therefore the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> stops rotating. Because the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> stops rotating also, the direction of the magnetic field projected to the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stays constant. The resultant pulse signal becomes either a signal a or a signal b shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) depending on the direction at this time. Accordingly, it is possible for the CPU <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to detect the occurrence of the thread breakage based on the detection signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is broken during the operation, a resultant pulse signal becomes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). This is because the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> become out of balance, disrupting a stable rotation of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may rotate faster and slower than a regular speed to increase and decrease the needle-thread supply speed. In this case also, the CPU <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can detect the occurrence of the thread breakage based on the detection signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next, a control mechanism will be described while referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The control device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes a microcomputer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, an I/O interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a driver <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> connected one another via a bus B. Although not shown in the drawings, the I/O interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> includes the above-mentioned waveform shaping circuit that shapes a sinusoidal wave signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the above-mentioned converter that converts the signal that has been shaped by the waveform shaping circuit into a rectangular pulse signal having the value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Connected to the I/O interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are an operation panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a start/stop (S/S) switch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an upper needle sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for detecting an upper needle position of the needle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a lower needle sensor <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for detecting a lower needle position of the needle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a sewing motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for rotating a main shaft (not shown) of the sewing machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the like. The sewing motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is driven by the driver <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The microcomputer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> includes a central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and a random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The ROM <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> stores a thread breakage detection control program (described later) and various control programs for processing the detection signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and detecting the breakage of the thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The RAM <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided with work memories, such as various flags, buffers, registers, and counters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Next, a control process of the thread breakage detection executed by the control device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will be described while referring to a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This process is started when the S/S switch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is turned ON. When the process starts, first in S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a counter I, which is for counting the detection signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is initialized to zero, and a timer TM is started. Both the counter I and the timer TM are stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Next in S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, detection signals from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the upper needle sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the lower needle sensor <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are detected, and it is determined in S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> whether or not the embroidery operation is currently performed. If not (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>:NO), then the process returns to S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If so (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>:YES), then the process proceeds to S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where it is determined whether or not the detection signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> has changed from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. If so (S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>:YES), then in S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the counter I is incremented by one, and process proceeds to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If not (S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>:NO), the process directly proceeds to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the timer TM has measured a predetermined time duration To, for example, 1 minute. If not (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>:NO), then the process returns to S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if so (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>:YES), then in S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the counter I has counted a predetermined count value Co. If so (S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>:YES), this means that the thread breakage has not occurred. The counter I is reset to zero and the timer TM restarts in S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), and the process returns to S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Here, the count value Co is set in accordance with the diameter of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, i.e., of the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the number of the poles (the north poles and the south poles (dividing number)), and an expending rate of the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during ordinary embroidery operation, which is in proportion to the rotation number of the sewing motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The count value Co can be set sufficiently small value, such as 10 or 50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If a negative determination is result in S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>:NO), this means that the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has stopped rotating in the middle of the embroidery operation, indicating that the thread breakage has occurred. The thread breakage is detected in S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the sewing motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> stops driving the main shaft in S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to stop the embroidery operation. Then, in S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a control signal is output to a buzzer driving circuit (not shown) to notify a user the thread breakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As described above, the thread breakage is detected based on the detection signal from the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is generated based on the magnetic field reaching to the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Because the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are integrally provided in the stitch balancing thread tension <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, there is no need to provide a thread-breakage detection device as a separate component from the stitch balancing thread tension <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This realizes a small-sized inexpensive thread-breakage detection unit, and thus reduces the overall size and production costs of the sewing machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This is particularly striking in the multi-needle sewing machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for industrial use that includes the plurality of needles <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, that is, the plurality of stitch balancing thread tensions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the single frame <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Because there is no need to provide a plurality of thread-breakage detection units separate from the stitch balancing thread tensions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the number of components is reduced, so that small-sized frame <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and thus the small-sized sewing machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Because the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is a component of the existing tension unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an available area to attach the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is limited. This requires designing the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in accordance with the limited area. However, it is easy to form the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a sintered metal into a desired shape. Here, it is conceivable to attach the conventional detection sensor including the photo interrupter and the encode disk to the existing tension unit. However, in this case, the configuration of the electric circuit becomes complex because of space limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Also, the arrangement of the north poles and the south poles is easily changed in the above embodiment. For example, increasing the number of the north poles and the south poles increases detection accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Because the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> rotates relative to the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> whose positioning is adjustable with respect to the frame <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, it is possible to adjust the relative position of the tension units <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the frame <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> without changing the relative positional relationship between the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Moreover, erroneous detection due to dust raised during the embroidery operation does not occur in the detection device using the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the hole element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This contrast to the above-described conventional detection device that uses the photo interrupter and the encode disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that it is possible to detect, when a thread breakage occurs, whether the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was broken or the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> was broken. Specifically, the expending amount of the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during ordinary embroidery operation can be calculated based on stitching data. During the ordinary operation, the actual expending amount of the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is calculated based on the rotation of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, matches the theoretical expending amount calculated based on the stitching data as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). However, when the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> breaks, the actual expending amount stops increasing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). On the other hand, when the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> breaks, irregular data, which indicating the actual expending amount, appear in the data pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). This is because the thread breakage of the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> disrupts the stable rotation of the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, so that the rotary disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> rotates faster and slower than the regular speed to increase and decrease the needle-thread supply speed. Accordingly, when the irregular data appears, it is detected that the thread that was broken is the bobbin thread <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, it is detected that the thread that was broken is the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> While some exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail, those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many possible modifications and variations which may be made in these exemplary-embodiments while yet retaining many of the novel features and advantages of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A rather than the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be used. The permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A includes a ring-shaped non-magnetic base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B with one or more permanent magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C. Also, the permanent magnet member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not necessarily formed of a sintered metal, but could be formed of one or more permanent magnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Although the above embodiment is described for the multi-needle sewing machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the plurality of needles <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the present invention can be applied to other type of sewing machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Moreover, although the broken-thread detecting unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided to the tension unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that applies a tension to the needle thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the broken-thread detecting unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> could be provided to a tension unit (not shown) that applies a tension to a bobbin thread if a sewing machine includes such a tension unit. </paragraph>
