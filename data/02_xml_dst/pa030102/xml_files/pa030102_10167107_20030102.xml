<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an escalator or a moving walkway with at least one support structure which is supported between bearings. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The support structure of a conventional escalator or a conventional moving walkway can bridge over only a relatively small span width. It is therefore long been known (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of DE 709291 C1 (1941)) to additionally support the support structure by a column in the middle. If it is desired to build longer escalators or moving walkways, several columns for additional support are necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With such a column support structure only very limited use can be made of the space below the moving walkway or below the escalator, because the columns are in the way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the present invention to provide an escalator or moving walkway of the foregoing kind with improved support means so that better utilisation can be made of the space in the region of the escalator or the moving walkway. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention the object is met by a moving walkway or an escalator of the foregoing kind, wherein at least one arch or at least one column is provided for support and that a support structure is connected at several points to the arch or column, preferably by way of cables or rods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the case of use of a column the support structure can be supported in the manner of a cable-stayed bridge, for example at nine points, although with the exception of one location the entire region below the moving walkway or below the escalator remains clear. The same applies to an arch construction, wherein it is additionally advantageous that the arch has its foundation in the vicinity of the bearings, so that a very long continuous region remains clear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous if a respective column or arch is provided at each of the two sides of the moving walkway or escalator, and that the columns or arches converge or run together above the escalator. Lateral stability is increased in this manner and, in addition, an elegant, slender appearance results.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The moving walkway is denoted generally by <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). It has at both sides a lateral support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is constructed in usual manner in the form of a framework. The support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is additionally supported at its two ends in bearings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> a column <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided at each side of the moving walkway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, forming a pylon construction. Cables <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are fastened to the columns <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at different heights, the cables extending obliquely relative to the support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and supporting it in the manner of a cable-stayed bridge. In the illustrated example four cables <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are provided at each side of each column support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (thus in total 16 cables). The moving walkway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thus additionally supported between the bearings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at, in total, nine points, but the entire space below the moving walkway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> remains clear except for the columns <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The two columns <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have a relatively large spacing at the bottom (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and join one another above the support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and moving walkway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Lateral stability is thereby also guaranteed. Self-evidently, an appropriately deep, concreted foundation is necessary. In addition, several pylons can obviously be provided in order to bridge over even greater distances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> an arch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be provided at both sides of the moving walkway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. These arches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have a greater spacing at the bottom than at the top and are connected together at several points by struts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Through these and through diagonal struts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the necessary lateral stability results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Cables <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> run from the arches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this example the support structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is supported at, in total, five points between the bearings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, almost the entire region below the moving walkway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> remains clear, if the foundations for the arches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which lie in the vicinity of the bearings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, are disregarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Moving walkways or escalators of the present type can find use in fairs, exhibitions, stations and so forth in order to bridge over large distances without a high number of center supports. </paragraph>
