<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display and, more particularly, to a sealing structure and a sealing method of liquid crystal display having improved adhesive strength of sealant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is generally known, a-liquid crystal display has a structure that a pair of transparent substrates is arranged opposite to each other and a liquid crystal layer is interposed between the substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The lower substrate has a structure that a plurality of gate bus lines and data bus lines are arranged in a matrix type to define a unit pixel area. An insulating layer is interposed between the lines to electrically isolate them. A thin film transistor is arranged at the intersection of the lines to operate as a switcher. Pixel electrodes are arranged in each pixel, composed of transparent metal. An alignment layer is applied on the top portion to control initial arrangement of liquid crystal molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The upper substrate has a structure that a black matrix is arranged at the position corresponding to the boundary of adjacent pixels to define unit pixels. Color resin layers are arranged at the position corresponding to each unit pixel of the lower substrate. A common electrode is provided to drive liquid crystals. An overcoating layer may be applied on the black matrix, color resin layer and common electrode to perform planation. An alignment layer is applied on the top portion to control the initial arrangement of liquid crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display, the upper and the lower substrates are firmly sealed with a predetermined distance, that is, a cell gap, to interpose the liquid crystal layer between the substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> lower substrate lOa and an upper substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are sealed by performing thermo-compression process in a state that a sealant <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is applied on the edge of one substrate with a predetermined width. In the drawing, reference codes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are polarizing plates, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a pixel electrode, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a black matrix, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a common electrode and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is an alignment layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The sealant <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be composed of thermosetting resins or UV-setting resins. The thermosetting resins have advantages of material stability, processing stability and convenience in use. The UV-setting resins have disadvantages that it is difficult to treat the material and to satisfy processing requirements, since printing or dispensing applies them. Moreover, the processing margin of cell gap maintenance is not wide due to rapid setting time. Therefore, thermosetting resins are widely used as a sealant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, thermosetting resins have different adhesive strength according to the material of adhesive side. That is, thermosetting resins have different adhesive strength with glass, insulating layer including protective layer, overcoating layer and metal layer. There are cases where leakage and substrates separation are generated in a panel comprising upper and lower substrates due to insufficient adhesive strength of thermosetting resins when a liquid crystal injection process is performed. Therefore, it is required to increase adhesive strength of thermosetting resins for improvement of product reliability, especially, in a large screen liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> sealant <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an alignment layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged with a predetermined distance to prevent brightness-spots generated by overlap of the sealant <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, alignment layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and liquid crystal layer (not shown). When they are overlapped, fine residuals and gas, generated in the formation of sealant, are mixed in the liquid crystal layer, thereby lowering resistivity of liquid crystals and generating brightness-spots on the screen in the application of voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the sealant <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the alignment layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged with a predetermined distance, it is required to increase adhesive strength of the sealant for improvement of product reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> method has been proposed that a plurality of moldings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed in a dot shape on a sealant coating region (SCR) around the display region (DR) of substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to increase adhesive strength of sealant. According to this method, it is possible to increase adhesive strength of sealant since the moldings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> increase the adhesive area of sealant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, when the position and the size of moldings are not desirably controlled, cell gap is increased in the position overlapped with the spacer or the glass fiber on the inner side of sealant, thereby generating irregularity of brightness on screen. And, the moldings can damage rubbing cloth when the alignment layer is rubbed, thereby generating rubbing defects and scratch. The above-mentioned problems are more frequent in a large screen liquid crystal display. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> are plan view and cross-sectional view showing a sealing structure and a sealing method of liquid crystal display according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the drawings, a reference code <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a substrate, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a lower substrate, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is an upper substrate, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are polarizing plates, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a pixel electrode, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is a black matrix, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a common electrode, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is an alignment layer, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is a dummy strengthening pattern comprising an alignment layer, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is a sealant, DR is a display region and SCR is a sealant coating region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, alignment layers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are applied on the display region DR of the substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and on surroundings of the display region DR, that is, the sealant-coating region SCR. The alignment layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the display region DR of substrate is formed to control the initial arrangement of liquid crystal molecules and that on the sealant-coating region SCR (hereinafter, referred to as a dummy strengthening pattern) <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is additionally formed to increase adhesive strength of sealant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> That is, the dummy strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed at the same time with the alignment layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the display region DR by applying alignment layer of poly imides type or poly amide type on the top portion of substrate and performing alignment treatment on the alignment layer by rubbing and then, etching the alignment layer. Here, modifying the etching mask used in pattering the conventional alignment layer without additional processes can form the dummy-strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The dummy-strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed on one or more of the substrates. Desirably, the dummy-strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed on both the lower <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the upper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>substrates. The dummy-strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate in contact with the sealant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in a line shape, generally in a frame shape. The dummy strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has a width of 1.0&tilde;1.5 mm, in contact with the sealant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> by the width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the structure, the lower <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the upper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>substrates are not directly sealed by the sealant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> comprising thermosetting resins but by interposing the dummy strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> additionally formed on the substrate in contact with the sealant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The sealant comprising thermosetting resins has improved adhesive strength than bare glass, ITO or overcoating layer with the alignment layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the sealing structure of the present invention has improved adhesive strength than the conventional one by at least three times since the dummy strengthening pattern, which comprises alignment layer having improved adhesive strength with the thermosetting resins, is additionally formed on the substrate in contact with the sealant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> comprising thermosetting resins, that is on the sealing region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> And, the dummy-strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is subjected to alignment treatment by rubbing as the alignment layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> applied on the display region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this case, the dummy-strengthening pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has a plurality of fine scratches on the surface thereof, thereby increasing the surface area and the chains for liquid crystal alignment are tangled with the sealant. As a result, it is possible to increase adhesive strength of substrates by the sealant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a graph showing adhesive strength of sealant by the adhesive side. In the graph, A, B and C sealant samples are thermosetting resins and the components are described in Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in the graph, all the samples have improved adhesive strength with the alignment layer than that of bare glass, ITO or black matrix. In conclusion, the sealant comprising thermosetting resins has improved adhesive strength with alignment layer.
