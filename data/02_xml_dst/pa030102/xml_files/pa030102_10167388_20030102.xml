<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a composition of a getter, and more particularly, to a composition of a getter and a field emission display using the same that is capable of lowering a temperature of an activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, recently, various flat panel displays are being developed to reduce a weight and a volume, the shortcomings of a cathode ray tube (CRT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The flat panel displays include a liquid crystal display (LCD), a field emission display (FED), a plasma display panel, an electro-luminescence (EL), and the like. In order to improve a display quality, researches are being actively conducted to heighten a luminance, a contrast and a colorimetric purity of the flat panel display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The FED is classified into a tip type FED in which a high electric field is concentrated on an acuminate emitter to emit electrons by a quantum mechanical tunnel effect, and a metal insulator metal (MIM) FED in which a high electric field is concentrated on a metal having a certain area to emit electrons by the quantum mechanical tunnel effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a tip type field emission display in accordance with a conventional art, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the tip type FED in accordance with the conventional art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the FED includes an upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on which an anode electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a fluorescent material <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are stacked; and a field emission array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed on the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The field emission array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a resistance layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sequentially formed on the lower substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a gate insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed on the resistance layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed on the gate insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supplies current to the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the resistance layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> restricts an overcurrent applied to the emitter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to supply a uniform current to the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The gate insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> insulates the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is used as a fetch electrode for fetching electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A spacer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is installed between the upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The spacer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> supports the upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so that a high vacuum state can be maintained between the upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For example, in order to display a picture, a negative polarity (&minus;) cathode voltage is applied to the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a positive polarity (&plus;) anode voltage is applied to the anode electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. And, a positive polarity (&plus;) gate voltage is applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, electron beams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> emitted from the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> collide with the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of red, green blue colors to excite the fluorescent material (phosphor). At this time, a visible ray of one of red, green and blue colors is luminescent. In this respect, in order to control each pixel, the FED is formed with a matrix structure as shown by the portion &lsquo;A&rsquo; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a gate structure of the FED in accordance with the conventional art, that is, a perspective view showing a gate structure formed in the matrix structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> First, the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are electrically insulated by the gate insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and formed to cross each other in a horizontal or in a vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Gate holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed at the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and emitters <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> corresponding to each gate hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed on the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is grounded and some &plus;100V voltage is applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a high electric field is generated at the end portions of the emitters <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> positioned at the part where the two electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> cross each other, and electrons <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are emitted by the high electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At this time, the voltage of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is lowered down as the size of the gate hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is reduced, and the voltage of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> differs depending on the characteristics of the material of the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. And, by applying a voltage sequentially to the cathode electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, electrons <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are emitted from the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the point where the two electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> cross each other so that the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is excited and accordingly light can be emitted from the pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, a high pressure of above a few kV is applied to the anode electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> coated with the fluorescent <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thereon, in order to accelerate the electrons <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> emitted from the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the electrons are collide with the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At this time, as for the luminance of each pixel and color implementation, the luminance of the pixel can be controlled by using a principle that the amount of current differs according to a voltage difference applied between the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the color can be implemented by controlling the luminance of the three pixels of adjacent red, green and blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The electric field emission space inside the panel of the FED should be maintained in a high vacuum state of above 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Torr in view of its driving characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> That is, the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are separated with a space of about a sub-micron therebetween, into which a high electric field of about 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>V/cm is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At this time, unless the space between the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is maintained in the high vacuum state, the voltage between the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be emitted or an insulator destruction phenomenon may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition, unless the electric field emission space is maintained in the high vacuum state, neutral particles existing inside the panel collide with the electrons to generate positive ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The generated positive ions collide with the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to degrade the emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or collide with the electrons <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to reduce an acceleration energy of the electrons <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to degrade the luminance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to improve the luminance, a vacuum process is necessary to make inside the panel to be in a high vacuum state during the fabrication process of the FED. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a panel structure of the FED in accordance with the conventional art. That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is to show the getter. Descriptions for constructions repeatedly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the panel of the FED includes an upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on which the anode electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are stacked; a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; a gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed on the insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; a lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with a focussing insulation layer (not shown) formed on the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; and a glass frit seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> supporting the upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, a getter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed inside the panel to absorb a gas generated during the FED fabrication process before the upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The getter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is classified into an evaporable getter (EG) and a non-evaporable getter (NEG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Barium is used as a material of the EG, and the EG is used for a cathode-ray tube forming a television screen and a computer screen. That is, the barium getter is evaporated by an external heating from an inner wall of the cathode-ray tube and used to remove a residual gas inside the cathode-ray tube as a metal film form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this respect, barium exists as a precursor of BaAl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus;Ni before activation, and the activation process is performed when the precursor of barium is evaporated by the external heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Substantially, a mixture of powder of the composition BaAl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and power of nickel is used as the precursor of the barium film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Nickel is reacted with aluminum at a temperature of about 850&deg; C. and the heat generated by the reaction evaporates barium according to a &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional art has problems that the structure for forming the EG inside the panel of the FET is complicated and when the EG is activated, the internal temperature goes up to 800&tilde;1250&deg; C. Thus, in case of the thin film display such as the FED, it is difficult to maintain the degree of vacuum since the substrate is damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the NEG uses titanium (Ti), Zirconium (Zr), or the like, as a main component and formed by adding other metals such as aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), Cobalt (Co) or ferrite (Fe) and oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The NEG heightens the degree of vacuum by removing a residual gas in a light bulb or an FED and used in various application field such as extension of durability of a device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the activation process of the NEG, after compressed and sintered power particles are combined, when they are first exposed in the air, a thin film of an oxide, a carbide and a nitride formed at the surface of the powder particles is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the activation process of the NEG, the material such as the oxide, the carbide and the nitride is heated to diffuse oxygen, carbon and nitrogen into the getter material, and then, the surface of the metal of the pure NEG, being in the activated state available for a gas adsorption, is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An activation temperature of the NEG depends on a composition. For example, a ST-707 produced and sold by SAES Getters of Italy is formed by activating an alloy of 70 weight % Zr, 24.6 weight % V and 5.4 weight % Fe at a temperature of 350&deg; C., and a st-101 is formed by activating an alloy of 84 weight % Zr and 26 weight % Al at a temperature of 900&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The activation process is preferably performed at a low temperature for a short time in consideration of a damage to a function of a specific device, an energy and a processing cost, and these matters are much required for the thin film type display such as the FED using the glass substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A technique related to the activation process that can be performed at a low temperature is disclosed in a Japanese patent publication No. &lsquo;8-196899&rsquo; and an International Patent Number &lsquo;PCT/IT 97/00027&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the Japanese patent publication No.: 8-196899, an oxidation agent such as titanium (Ti), titanium oxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and a barium oxide (BaO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is heated by a heater, mixed at a suitable ratio so that a reaction heat can be generated, and then pressurized in order to construct an NEG system of a certain shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As for the two oxides (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, BaO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), in order to form Ti<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, the intermediate oxide of titanium, titanium is partially oxidized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The reaction heat according to the oxidation reaction should activate residual titanium, and the mixture is activated at a temperature of 300&tilde;400&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The International Patent Number &lsquo;PCT/IT 97/00027&rsquo; discloses a composition of a getter comprising oxide selected from the group of Ag<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, CuO and Co<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or their mixture and an alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A third component such as yttrium and lanthanum existing in rare earth elements can be selectively added to the alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In general, among the composition, the getter material requires a high temperature of 350&tilde;900&deg; C. for its activation, while the getter device containing all of the compositions can be operated at a temperature of 280&tilde;500&deg; C., a comparatively low temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> That is, the getter device can be activated at a comparatively low temperature by using a reaction heat using thermodynamic interaction with other element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> However, when the NEG alloy suddenly comes in contact with a large amount of reactive gas, that is, when it is exposed in the air, and when the initial alloy has a melting point of above 200&tilde;250&deg; C., the alloy makes a strong exothermic reaction to increase the temperature up to above 1000&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a possibility that other portion of the FED panel is damaged, so that it can hardly be adoptable to the thin film display such as the FED or the PDP (plasma display panel; PDP). </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The composition ratio of the composition of the getter is calculated on the assumption that the weight of the getter is 100 weight %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The composition ratio of the composition of the getter is preferably 40 weight % Cr, 30 weight % Zr and 30 weight % Ti. And, at this time, the getter is formed as a sputtering type or a bulk type. A method for fabricating the sputtering type getter and the bulk type getter will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart of sputtering type getter fabricating method of the FED. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> First, one of upper substrate and lower substrate is prepared (step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Second, the prepared substrate is mounted in a chamber in a vacuum state (step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Third, argon (Ar), a non-active gas, is injected between the getter material, Cr, Zr and Ti, and the anode electrode. In this respect, the composition of the getter and the anode electrode are installed in the chamber (S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Fourth, argon (Ar) is excited by using plasma. At this time, argon electrons (Ar&plus;) inside the chamber are accelerated by the high voltage generated by the excited argon electrons (Ar&plus;) (step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Fifth, getter materials, sprung up as the argon electrons (Ar&plus;) accelerated in the chamber are the composition (Cr&mdash;Zr&mdash;Ti group) of the getter collide with each other, are deposited on the prepared substrate with a thickness of 0.01&tilde;10 &mgr;m. That is, the sputtering type getter is formed by depositing the getter materials having the thickness of 0.01&tilde;10 &mgr;m on the substrate (step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow chart of a bulk type getter fabricating method of the FED. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> First, one of an upper substrate and a lower substrate is prepared (step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Second, Cr, Zr and Ti, the composition of getter, are crushed on the prepared substrate to make powders and then the metal powders are mixed step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Third, the mixed metal powders are sintered and then deposited with a particle size of about 1&tilde;100 &mgr;m on the prepared substrate. That is, the mixed metal powers are deposited with the particle size of 1&tilde;100 &mgr;m on the substrate, thereby forming a bulk type getter (step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> are graphs showing an oxygen rejection capability of a getter in accordance with the conventional art and the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> show the oxygen rejection capability of the getters in accordance with the conventional art and the present invention by using an auger electron spectroscopy (AES) spectrum under the thermal treatment condition of a temperature of 300&deg; C. for 1 hour in the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The AES is surface analyzing equipment by which, after electron beams focussed with a size of hundreds of armstrong are made incident on the surface of the getter, the energy of the emitted auger electrons is measured to thereby analyze the type and amount of the element constructing the surface of the getter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the lateral axis of the graph indicates a depth from the surface of the getter and the longitudinal axis of the graph indicates the composition of the getter or the amount of the impurity absorbed into the getter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> For example, in the conventional art, the amount of oxygen absorbed into the getter formed by 70 weight % Zr and 30 weight % Ti is much discovered from the surface of the getter to about 2000 arb. but the oxygen is sharply reduced from there (2000 arb.) and oxygen is little found from above about 3000 arb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, as having been absorbed into the getter comprising 40 weight % Cr, 30 weight % Ti and 30 weight % Zr components, a large amount of oxygen exists from the surface of the getter up to above about 5000 arb. Thus, it is noted that more amount of oxygen than in the conventional art can be absorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as for the activation temperature and activation time, the composition of getter of the present invention is sufficiently activated at the temperature of 300&deg; C. for 1 hour of the above experiment conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a pump connection to the FED in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in order to remove impurities inside the panel which has been sintered and bonded, the panel is heated by a local heating unit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to exhaust gas inside the panel outwardly by using a pump <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> While the gas is exhausted from inside the panel outwardly of the chamber, when the degree of vacuum inside the panel reaches a desired level, the middle portion of an exhaust tube <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is heated and then cut out through a pinch-off process. That is, the chamber of the panel is isolated from the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> At this time, a pressure according to the degree of vacuum required for the panel of the conventional art is 2.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>torr while a pressure according to the degree of vacuum required for the panel of the present invention is 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Functions of the anode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the glass frit seals <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are the same as in the conventional art, of which descriptions are, therefore, omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when performing the pinch-off process, the internal degree of vacuum of the closed panel in a state that the impurities has been discharged from the device inside the panel, is reduced again due to a reason such as an exhaust gas. Thus, in order to increase the degree of vacuum, the getter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is activated at a temperature of 300&deg; C. for 3 hours, which will now be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> are graphs showing vacuum recover degree of the FED coated with a getter material in accordance with the conventional art and the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, in the conventional art, the getter comprising 30 weight % Ti and 70 weight % Zr is activated at the temperature of 300&deg; C. for 3 hours, the pressure according to the degree of vacuum of the panel is restored to 1.03&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, in case that the getter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comprising 40 weight % Cr, 30 weight % Ti and 30 weight % Zr is activated at the temperature of 300&deg; C. for three hours, the pressure according to the degree of vacuum of the panel is restored to 1.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>torr, about 6 times higher than that of the conventional art, to complete the final panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</cross-reference> are graphs showing an oxygen rejection capability of the getter from a fresh state to a sealing step and to an activation step in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</cross-reference>, the composition of a getter is deposited through the activation process of about three hours at the temperature of about 300&deg; C. and exposed in the air, or oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the getter is moved into the getter through a high temperature sealing process, so as to have the same state as the surface of the getter in the fresh state. This can be obviously noted through the auger electron spectroscopy spectrum as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The FED using the getter of the present invention includes: an upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on which the anode electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> coated thereon is stacked; a lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>; a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed on the lower glass substrate; a resistance layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed on the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; an insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed on the resistance layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; a gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed on the insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; an emitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed on the insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; a focussing insulation layer formed on the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; and a getter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> formed between the upper glass substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and comprising the group of Ct&mdash;Ti&mdash;Zr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The emitter emits electrons according to a voltage applied from the cathode, and the gate electrode fetches electrons from the emitter. The anode is formed facing the cathode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Except for the getter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the other constructions of the FED is the same as in the conventional art, of which descriptions are, thus, omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As so far described, the composition of a getter and the FED using the getter of the present invention has many advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> That is, for example, first, since the oxygen rejection capacity of the getter having Chrome as a main component is improved, the activation energy becomes small compared with that of the conventional art. That is, as the activation energy becomes small, the activation process can be performed at a low temperature of below 300&deg; C., and the pressure according to the gas rejection capability and the degree of vacuum is improved by about <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> times that of the conventional art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In addition, the getter having chrome as the main component can be easily formed as a sputtering type or the bulk type without having such an existing complicate stacking structure or a porous forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims. </paragraph>
