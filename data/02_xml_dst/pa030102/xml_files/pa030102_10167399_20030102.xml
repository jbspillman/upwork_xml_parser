<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to airtight waterproof slide fastener, which is employed at a portion demanding airtight waterproof performance under high pressures such as in diving suits and underwater tunnels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Engagement teeth for the airtight waterproof slide fastener provided currently are largely divided into two types of structures, which are an engagement tooth structure disclosed in, for example, Germany Patent No.856881, Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 58-181210, and Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 63-8763, and an engagement tooth structure disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 1-54041, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2-16648, and Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 5-2098. Composing elements of these engagement teeth include a spear-shaped coupling element having a coupling head at its front end and a substantially U-shaped clamp element having a nipping portion composed of a pair of small sheet pieces and a connecting portion for connecting end portions thereof. This clamp element is usually obtained by fastening a rectangular sheet piece into a substantially U-letter shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the engagement tooth structure disclosed in the above-mentioned Germany Patent No.856881, Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 58-181210, and Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 63-8763, the coupling element is so constructed as to be directed from the center of the inside of the connecting portion of the clamp element such that the coupling head is exposed out and protruded integrally therewith. In order to fix this engagement teeth to the airtight waterproof fastener tape, insertion holes for the coupling heads are formed at a predetermined pitch along a side edge of this airtight waterproof tape and the coupling head of the engagement tooth is passed through this hole. Then, the airtight waterproof tape is bent and pushed in the shape of &OHgr; such that the insertion hole forming portion makes a firm contact with a curved bottom of the clamp element and then, the clamp element is fastened from both front and rear sides so as to nip the tape firmly in order to produce the airtight waterproof fastener stringer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, according to the structure of the engagement tooth disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 1-54041, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2-16648, and Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 5-2098, a coupling element comprising a coupling head at a front end thereof and an spear-shaped coupling element having a rectangular flange at the rear end thereof, and a substantially U-shaped clamp element are formed separately. To fix the engagement tooth onto the airtight waterproof tape, a side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape is wound around from the flange side to the coupling head at the front end such that it wraps and holds the coupling element. Then, the clamp element is held through the airtight waterproof tape from the flange side of the coupling element up to just before the coupling head and fastened strongly so that the tape wraps and holds the clamp element. Consequently, the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape is bent in the shape of &OHgr; by means of the clamp element, so that the tape is nipped and fixed firmly, thereby an airtight waterproof fastener stringer is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Air-tightness and waterproofness of these airtight waterproof slide fasteners is warranted by contact pressing force of the airtight waterproof tape portion which is bent and exposed outward between the coupling head of each of a pair of opposing fastener stringers and the clamp element. If this contact pressing force is weak, gap is generated between the tapes pressing each other, by hydraulic pressure or other external forces applied to the airtight waterproof tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By the way, in the above-described engagement tooth comprising integrated coupling element and clamp element, management of parts is facilitated because the number of required parts is reduced. However, to fix the engagement tooth to the airtight waterproof tape, insertion holes for the coupling heads need to be formed in the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape. Further, after inserting the coupling head into the insertion hole, it is necessary to push the tape toward the bottom face of the clamp element so that it is bent in the shape of letter U. Consequently, this fixing structure allows the airtight waterproof tape to move easily in the width direction of the tape, so that the nipping and fixing force by the clamp element tends to weaken. Thus, as described in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 58-181210, a lip for nipping the tape is projected from opposing faces at open side end portions of the clamp element so as to increase the fixing strength of the engagement tooth to the airtight waterproof tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For the airtight waterproof slide fastener of this type, securing its airtight waterproof performance depends upon contact pressing force between opposing tape portions when opposing engagement teeth of a pair of fastener stringers are coupled. Then, if a tongue piece is formed such that it is projected outward at right angle from one end or both ends of front and rear sides of the clamp element bent in a substantially U shape so as to increase the contact area, necessary contact pressing force is secured such that necessary airtight waterproof performance is easily obtained. However, formation of the tongue piece such that it is projected outward of the clamp element increases the thickness of the entire slider, which is a fastener opening/closing device, in a direction perpendicular to the airtight waterproof tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the structure of the engagement tooth comprising a coupling element and a clamp element formed separately as indicated by the above Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 1-54041, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2-16648 and Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 5-2098, fixing work to the airtight waterproof tape is easy although the number of parts increases. Further, because fixing strength to the airtight waterproof tape is intensified by existence of a flange formed at the proximal end portion of the coupling element, this is a preferable engagement tooth structure from the viewpoint of practicability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In any one of the above-mentioned engagement tooth structures, almost all conventional clamp elements have substantially rectangular shapes and opposing side faces in adjacent nipping portions of the clamp element are parallel to each other. Its exception is the above-mentioned Germany Patent no.856881. According to this specification, each clamp element fixed to a side edge of a pair of the fastener stringers in zigzag shape is formed in the shape of a trapezoid, whose width is decreased gradually toward a front end of the nipping portion when seen in side view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Because the front end faces of the nipping portions of the clamp element disposed such that they oppose each other are disposed being shifted completely in the tape direction, they do not have any overlapping opposing faces. Thus, necessary contact pressing force between the waterproof tapes is not generated and airtight waterproof performance is reduced because no direct pressure force is applied to the airtight waterproof tape by the respective front end faces of the opposing nipping portions of the clamp element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, in the airtight waterproof slide fastener of this type, products with this fastener such as a diving suit may be folded or left without being tidied up, and be trod when they are not used. At this moment, the fastener stringer of the airtight waterproof slide fastener is folded between the engagement teeth at the same time. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a folding condition of a fastener stringer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at this moment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is a front view of the same fastener stringer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is a plan view of major parts of the same fastener stringer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> when seen from a folded side i.e., an inner side of the folded stringer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Because the nipping portion of an ordinary clamp element provides a rectangular shape when seen in side view thereof as described above, the outside ridgelines of opposing nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the clamp elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> adjacent to each other on the folded side make a firm contact while the outside ridgelines of nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on an opposite side across an airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are about to open largely in the longitudinal direction of the tape with respect to the contact portion between the outside ridgelines on the folded side of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> That is, because of the turning around an outside ridgeline of the nipping portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, compression stress is applied to the airtight waterproof tape portion on a side in which the outside ridgelines make a firm contact while a strong tensile stress is applied to an airtight waterproof portion located between the outside ridgelines on the opposite side across the same tape <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at the same time. Consequently, the airtight waterproof tape portion on the side in which the tensile stress is applied is torn out easily. This rapture of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> loses the airtight waterproof performance, which should be a primary function of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been achieved to solve the above-described problem and a concrete objective of the invention is to provide an airtight waterproof slide fastener of this kind capable of securing air-tightness and which is not broken easily even if it is bent strongly in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The inventors have repeated discussions and experiments from various aspects in order to achieve the above objective. As a result, they recognized that it is effective to employ the structure as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to its basic structure, there is provided an airtight waterproof slide fastener having a pair of fastener stringers in which a side edge of an airtight waterproof tape wraps and holds plurality of coupling elements from flange sides, makes their coupling heads project outward, and is folded so as to form an engagement tooth holding portion having a substantially &OHgr;-shaped cross section on the side edge of the tape and a peripheral face of this engagement tooth holding portion is nipped and fixed with a substantially U-shaped clamp element constituted of a nipping portion comprised of a pair of sheet-like nipping pieces and a connecting portion for connecting ends of respective nipping pieces, wherein the clamp element comprises a stress-releasing portion for releasing tensile stress generated in a tape portion existing between side faces of adjacent nipping pieces when the airtight waterproof tape is folded between adjacent clamp elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the tape face of the airtight waterproof slide fastener of this kind having a conventional ordinary structure is folded in the longitudinal direction of the airtight waterproof tape, the outside ridgelines of opposing nipping pieces of adjacent clamp elements on the folded side make a firm contact and the clamp element is turned around the contact portion of the outside ridgelines, so that the same tape is opened largely between the outside ridgelines opposite to the folded side of the airtight waterproof tape. At this time, the contact portion of each outside ridgeline making a firm contact is locked and not moved relatively, so that the center of turning is fixed. Consequently, the folded airtight waterproof tape receives a large tensile stress in the longitudinal direction on an opposite side to the folded side between both clamp elements, so that it is broken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the present invention, a stress-releasing portion is formed to release excessive tensile stress generated partly in a tape portion located between the nipping portions on the front and rear face sides of the clamp element, which wraps and holds the airtight waterproof tape substantially in a C-shape. Consequently, when the airtight waterproof slide fastener is folded as described above, the firm contact position between the ridgeline portions is allowed to be moved relatively because of existence of the stress-releasing portion, so as to release excessive tensile stress between the nipping pieces at the opposite side of the folded side. As a result, no excessive tensile stress is generated in the ridgeline opposite to the folded side, so that a rapture of the airtight waterproof tape at that position is avoided effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, it is preferable that front end faces opposing each other of the nipping portions disposed such that they oppose in a zigzag shape at a predetermined pitch along opposing edge portions of a pair of the fastener stringers when the engagement teeth are coupled, are partly overlapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Generally, the clamp element has lip portions, which are formed on opposing end faces on front and rear nipping pieces such that they are projected so as to approach each other. When the engagement tooth portion of the airtight waterproof tape bent substantially in a &OHgr; shape is nipped strongly by means of the front and rear nipping pieces by fastening the clamp element, the lip portions provided inward protrudedly at the front ends of the nipping pieces bite into the engagement tooth holding portion so as to enhance the fixing thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to experiments by the inventors of the present invention, when the front face of the lip portion is formed in an appropriate size, even if a tongue projected to an opposite side to the lip portion is not formed at a front end of the nipping portion, necessary contact pressing force can be applied to bent portions of the airtight waterproof tapes, said bent portions being exposed outward and opposing each other, by means of pressure forces by front faces of the lip portions which generate when the airtight waterproof slide fastener is fastened. Consequently, it was proved that a sufficient air-tightness is secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the clamp element is fixed to each fastener stringer so that the front faces of the lip portions are disposed so as to oppose each other in a zigzag shape at a predetermined pitch along the opposing edge portions of a pair of the fastener stringers, when the engagement teeth are coupled. However, as described in the Germany Patent No. 856881, if the opposing faces of the clamp elements are shifted in the longitudinal direction of the tape, so that there is no overlapping portion to which the pressure force should be directly applied, no sufficient contact pressing force is generated on exposed opposing edges between the airtight waterproof tapes of a pair of the fastener stringers. Thus, according to the present invention, the opposing faces of the clamp elements, which are arranged so as to oppose each other in a zigzag shape, are disposed so as to partly overlap each other always. In this way, necessary contact pressing force between the airtight waterproof tapes are ensured and thereby airtight waterproof performance of the airtight waterproof slide fastener is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, it is preferable that the stress-releasing portion includes a tapered face in which, in plan view of the clamp element, the width of the side face of the nipping portion is decreased gradually at a predetermined angle in a direction from an end face on the connecting portion side of the clamp element toward a front end of the nipping portion with a start position, which is on a front end side from a position whose distance from the end face on the connecting portion is determined by summing up the thickness of the clamp element and the thickness of the airtight waterproof tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If the tape face of the airtight waterproof tape of the airtight waterproof slide fastener is folded in a longitudinal direction, the outside ridgelines on the nipping pieces on the folded side of the adjacent nipping portions located at a portion to be folded make a firm contact with each other as described above, so that the nipping portion is turned with that contact portion as a fulcrum point. Consequently, a large tensile stress is generated at the airtight waterproof tape located opposite to the folded side and between the adjacent clamp elements. If the nipping portion of the clamp element is rectangular in plan view as a conventional clamp element is, when the airtight waterproof slide fastener is folded as described above, the front end of the nipping portion of the clamp element is located on a tape main body side of the overlapping airtight waterproof tape, while the connecting portion side of the clamp element is located at a free end side of the airtight waterproof tape. Therefore, the folding configuration in the longitudinal direction of the tape is similar to a part of a substantially cylindrical shape in which the connecting portion side is stretched while the front end side of the nipping portion is compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As a result, the clamp elements make a firm contact at the outside ridgeline portions on the front end side of the adjacent nipping portions with the folding portion of the airtight waterproof slide fastener as the center, the side faces on the connecting portion side are slightly open. In this situation, little internal stress is generated inside the folded portion of the engagement tooth holding portion in the airtight waterproof tape folded at the base portion side of the coupling element, while an excessive tensile stress is generated so as to stretch the outside of the folded portion largely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention is achieved with focus on the above-described folding configuration. At first, it was considered that the stress-releasing portion could be made by providing right and left side faces of the nipping portion of each clamp element each with a tapered face whose front end side becomes narrower gradually like the above-described substantial cylindrical shape. However, according to the fixing structure of the engagement tooth to the airtight waterproof tape of the present invention, as mentioned above, the clamp element is bent and fixed to the airtight waterproof tape so that the airtight waterproof tape and the clamp element wrap and hold the coupling element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To nip the airtight waterproof tape strongly with the entire nipping portions of the clamp element with such a fixing structure, it is preferable to ensure at least the same nipping force at a border face between the nipping portion and the connecting portion as that of conventional ones. For this purpose, as in the present invention, at least the airtight waterproof tape&apos;s engagement tooth holding portion bent substantially in a C-shape and the border face from the connecting portion of the clamp element up to the nipping portion need to have a similar width in the longitudinal direction of the tape to that of conventional ones. Thus, in the present invention, the start point of the tapered face, whose width is reduced gradually toward the front end of the nipping portion, is set up at a position determined by summing up the thickness of the clamp element and the tape thickness of the airtight waterproof tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention having the above-mentioned structure, a fixing strength necessary for the engagement tooth to fix the airtight waterproof slide fastener is secured, and when the airtight waterproof slide fastener is folded in a longitudinal direction, the tapered face serves as a stress-releasing portion, so as to avoid an interference to each other. Even if the outside ridgeline portions make a contact, they are just only in a slight contact when the folding is completed. Thus, no excessive tensile stress is generated in an airtight waterproof tape portion existing between a nipping portion opposite to the folded side and the connecting portion, so that rapture in the airtight waterproof tape portion can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the tapered angle of the tapered face on both side faces of the clamp element is 3&deg; to 7&deg; as in the present invention. If the tapered angle is less than 3&deg;, the outside ridgeline portions of the adjacent nipping pieces on the folded side make a firm contact with each other so that they are locked. Consequently, the function as the stress-releasing portion is not exerted sufficiently, so that rapture is easily generated in the airtight waterproof tape between the clamp elements on a folding side i.e., an outer side of the folded stringer. Meanwhile, if the tapered angle exceeds 70&deg;, a direct pressure force, which is applied to between the clamp elements disposed such that they oppose each other, is unlikely to be generated when the airtight waterproof slide fastener is fastened. Thus, the contact pressing force between the opposing airtight waterproof tapes is not generated effectively, and obtaining necessary air-tightness performance becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that the stress-releasing portion includes chamfered portions on the peripheral face of the front end-side corner portion of the nipping portion. In addition, it is preferable that the stress-releasing portion includes a chamfered portion formed on outside ridgeline portions of the nipping portion. Moreover, the stress-releasing portion including a chamfered portion formed at least on an end portion of the inside ridge line portion of the nipping portion is formed in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Any of these stress-releasing portions can avoid effectively rupture of a part of the airtight waterproof tape between the clamp elements around the folded portion when the airtight waterproof slide fastener is bent in a longitudinal direction.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described concretely with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this embodiment comprises, as conventionally, an airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, engagement teeth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a slider (not shown), upper/bottom stop ends (not shown) and so on. The airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consists of rubber material or soft synthetic resin sheet alone or water tight material such as a fabric coated with rubber or elastomer resin. A side edge portion of that tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is bent along the longitudinal direction and the engagement teeth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are fixed at a predetermined interval along the side edge portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the engagement tooth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which consist of different members. In the meantime, the present invention also includes a case where the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed integrally. If the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are constructed separately, part of the shape of the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is different, as mentioned above, from a case where the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed integrally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The entire configuration of the said coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed separately in this embodiment is not different from conventional examples, and includes a spear-shaped coupling head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which has a rectangular cross section at a front end of a rectangular column portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a rectangular flange <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>at a proximal end of the rectangular column portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having such a configuration, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is bent so as to wrap and hold the flange <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and further, a tape main body side and a tape side-edge side are bent so that they are opened widely so as to form an engagement tooth holding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in which cross section of the entire bent part is substantially in the shape of &OHgr;, so that the coupling head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be exposed outside of the engagement tooth holding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is bent and deformed with force along the peripheral face of the engagement tooth holding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is bent so as to wrap and hold the flange <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the rectangular column portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the coupling element, so that plurality of the engagement teeth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are fixed at a predetermined interval on the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In order to arrange plurality of the coupling elements <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a line and wrap and hold these coupling elements <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, plurality of the coupling elements <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are arranged successively at a predetermined interval along the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> before the coupling elements <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are wrapped and held with the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is bent substantially in a U-shape as described above, is constituted of a bent sheet piece in which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> pair of sheet-like nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>inclined such that an interval between one ends thereof is wider than that between the other ends are connected by a connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the said other ends of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Lip portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed at respective end portions opposite to connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sides of respective nipping piece <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, such that the lip portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are protruded in a direction opposed to each other. Meanwhile, concave grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in a bending inner face of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> including the lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> such that they are extended linearly in the bending direction. The central side faces of the connecting portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the adjacent clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected integrally by a connecting lever <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. After the clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are bent and deformed further so as to be mounted on the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the connecting lever <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is cut out, the engagement teeth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are fixed integrally on the side edge portion of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a fastener stringer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is produced thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A slider (not shown) is mounted on a pair of the fastener stringers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having a predetermined length, and an upper stop end (not shown) is fixed on an end of the stringer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while a bottom stop end (not shown) is fixed on the other end. The airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is produced thereby. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a sectional view when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is closed with the slider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The structure of the fastener described above is substantially the same as conventional fasteners except for the structure of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The conventional clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has a substantially rectangular shape in its plan view as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. In contrast, in the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, a stress-releasing portion for an excessive tensile stress, which is generated in the tape portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the engagement tooth holding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>located between the adjacent clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is bent, is formed in the nipping portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is a distinguished feature of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> showing the structure of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of this embodiment and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> showing the structure of the conventional clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> First, the structure of the conventional clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is described briefly with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The entire configuration of the clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as that of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of this embodiment. However, in the conventional clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the nipping portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are composed of substantially-rectangular small pieces and the width in the longitudinal direction of the tape thereof is the same throughout an entire region of the nipping portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Moreover, no special processing is applied to ridgeline portions of outside and inside faces of the respective nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and each ridgeline portion are angled substantially at 90&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the conventional fastener stringer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is bent in its longitudinal direction along its tape surface, in a plan view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(B), the ridgeline portions on front end sides of the bent nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are fit to each other between the engagement tooth <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at a bending center and its adjacent engagement tooth <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the engagement teeth tend to separate from each other at the connection portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> sides. Consequently, tensile stress is generated in the tape portion on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> sides of said adjacent clamp elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At this moment, the adjacent clamp element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, moved around the aforementioned portion, in which the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on a bent side are fit to each other, so that a force is applied to move the nipping piece <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>opposite to the bent side in such a direction that they separate from each other. Moreover, a tensile stress is generated in a tape portion on a connecting portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> side, when seen in plan view. Consequently, an extremely high tensile stress is generated in a tape portion of the engagement tooth holding portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>located between the nipping piece <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, particularly in the tape portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> side. As a consequence, the tape portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>begins to be broken by the nipping piece <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from a nipping end portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the configuration of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, various stress-releasing portions are formed in parts of each nipping piece <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This prevents the tape portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side in the engagement tooth holding portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from being broken easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, said stress-releasing portion of this embodiment includes a tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed on each of the right and left side faces of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and chamfered portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>formed on inside and outside the ridgeline portions. Further, as shown by a symbol R in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the corner portion at the front end of each nipping piece <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, particularly an inside corner portion thereof, is chamfered and formed in a small arc face as a chamfered portion. Although this embodiment allows far various stress-releasing portions to be formed, not all these stress-releasing portions are necessary in some cases and therefore, a part of them may be cancelled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Upon designing the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which is the most effective means as the stress-releasing portion for the tensile stress, there are points to which more attention should be paid than those upon designing of the other stress-releasing portions. These points will be described concretely together with their functions with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference> and Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A first point to which attention should be paid is the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which is to be formed on the nipping portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Generally, the size and arrangement pitch of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are determined preliminarily depending upon the dimension (width, length and the like) and application purpose of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the structure of the tape, or material. If the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed from the outside edge of the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> up to a front end of the nipping portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so that the tapered face is substantially trapezoidal in plan view of the clamp element, nipping force on the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to this embodiment, as for the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a substantial nipping area for the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is secured on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side so as to ensure a necessary nipping force on the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. That is, the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is set up at a dimensional position H, whose distance from an outside end face of the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is at least D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or more, wherein D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the thickness of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the thickness of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is set up on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side with respect to this dimensional position H, the engagement teeth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are more likely to be disengaged because of a lateral pulling force of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A next point to which attention should be paid is a tapered angle a of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As described above, if this tapered angle &agr; is too small, the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is more likely to be partly broken out when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is folded. If the tapered angle &agr; is too large, the width dimensions W of the front ends of nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> becomes small, so that an overlapping portion W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between front end faces of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of opposing clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a pair of fastener stringers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is eliminated. Consequently, contact pressing force which is generated between the opposing airtight waterproof tapes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is decreased, so that a required airtight waterproof performance cannot be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows changes in air-tightness of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accompanied by changes in tapered angle &agr; of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In this tapered angle &agr;, the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is located at a position whose distance from the outside end face of the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is determined by summing the thickness D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If the formation start point of this tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is changed, the range of a preferred tapered angle &agr;, with which breaking of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> does not occur even when fastener is folded, is changed automatically in relation with the contact pressing force between the airtight waterproof tapes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When the tapered angle (clearance angle) &agr; is 0&deg; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, no tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed and the side faces of adjacent clamp elements are in parallel. If the tapered angle &agr; of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is changed from 0&deg; to 8&deg; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it is understood that air-tightness of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is decreased gradually from 2 to 0.7 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Therefore, if air-tightness of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is taken into great account, the tapered angle &agr; is preferred to be 5&deg; or less, as indicated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> However, in addition to improvement of airtight performance, another major object of the present invention is to prevent the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from being partly broken when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is bent strongly in the longitudinal direction as described above. Thus, the following experiment was carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Rubber coated fiber fabric tape was employed as the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the coupling element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the engagement tooth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was constructed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the nipping portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was located at a dimensional position H whose distance from the outside end face of the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is determined by summing the thickness D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the tape thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Under this condition, the tapered angle &agr; was set to be 0&deg;, 2&deg;, 5&deg;, and 8&deg;, and the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>was formed on an entire side face from the dimensional position H to the front end of the nipping portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Ten airtight waterproof slide fasteners <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> were produced thereby. For each fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, averages of stringer bending resistance (tape rapture resistance upon bending), air-tightness (kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), overlapping ratio (pressure amount ratio) (%), and chain lateral pulling resistance (kgf/in) of each tapered angle &agr; were calculated. Here, the stringer bending resistance was estimated by folding each airtight waterproof slide fastener 10 300 times and evaluating the degree of rapture with &ldquo;X,&rdquo; &ldquo;&Dgr;,&rdquo; &ldquo;&xcirc;,&rdquo; and &ldquo;&ocir;&rdquo; from the worst to the best. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to Table 1, the stringer bending resistance rises as the tapered angle &agr; increases, from &ldquo;&Dgr;&rdquo; when the taper angle &agr; is 2&deg; to &ldquo;&xcirc;&rdquo; when 5&deg; and &ldquo;&ocir;&rdquo; when 8&deg;. On the other hand, the air-tightness decreases as the tapered angle &agr; increases and it can be understood that this occurs depending on the overlapping ratio between opposing front faces of the clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air-tightness increases as this overlapping ratio increases. Further, it is understood that the chain lateral pulling resistance indicating fallout strength of the engagement tooth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when a pair of the fastener stringers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are pulled laterally in a separating direction from each other has enough strength to bear sufficiently even if the tapered angle &agr; is 8&deg; if the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is set up as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As described above, the tapered angle &agr; is a major factor which greatly affects airtight waterproof performance and durability of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, particularly in avoiding a rapture of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is folded. Therefore, upon setting the tapered angle &agr;, it is necessary to take into account other factors such as the formation start point of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, chamfered portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>formed on the inside and outside ridgeline portions of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and setting amount for the arc face R formed on the corner portion at the front end of each of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For the reasons above, the tapered angle &agr; of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is preferred to be 3&deg; to 70&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, if, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, the chamfered portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are formed on the ridgeline portion on the outside ridgeline portion of the opposite side of the tape side and on the tape side of each nipping piece <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is folded as described above, slippage occurs between the chamfered portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>because they are chamfered even if the outside ridgeline portions of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the adjacent clamp elements <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> make a firm contact with each other on the folded side. Consequently, its firm contact point is moved so that the tensile stress generated in the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> existing between the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are in the opposite side of the folded side, and particularly in the tape portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side of that nipping piece <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is released. In this way, rapture of the tape portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, as indicated by the sign R in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if the small arc face is formed on the front-end corner portion of each nipping piece <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, when the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is folded, the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>make a firm contact with each other at the corner portion of each front end side of the adjacent nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the folded side so as to form a fulcrum point to turn the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, the fulcrum point is moved because of the arc face R, so that a part of stress generated in the tape portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side of the nipping pieces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>located opposite to the folded side is released as with the chamfered portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. In this way, rapture of the tape portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The above description indicates preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is not necessary to provide, for example, the stress-releasing portion formed on the clamp element with all of the tapered face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the chamfered portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and the arc face R. In some cases, the objective of the present invention can be achieved sufficiently with any one part of the stress-releasing portions or a combination thereof depending on the length or width of the airtight waterproof slide fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tape material of the airtight waterproof tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, size of the clamp element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the like. Therefore, naturally, the present invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments but may be modified within the scope of respective claims. </paragraph>
