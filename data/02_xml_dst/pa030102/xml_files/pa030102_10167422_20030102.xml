<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, and more particularly to a so-called active matrix type liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, a liquid crystal display device has been popularly used as a display equipment of image information and character information for an information equipment represented by a personal computer, a portable information terminal, a portable telephone, or a visual equipment such as digital camera or a VTR equipment with a built-in camera or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Recently, along with the spreading of large capacity media brought about by the advent of DVDs and the rapid progress of large-capacity magnetic drives and the starting of BS digital broadcasting, the fusion of personal computers and video digital media has been in progress and the demand for an image display device of high image quality which can cope with these applications has been increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display adopting an in-plane switching (IPS) mode has been admitted as a display method which can satisfy the demand for high image quality and various improvements have been made to obtain the further enhancement of the image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Here, the IPS mode liquid crystal display is a display which is constituted such that on each liquid-crystal-side pixel region of one substrate out of a pair of substrates which are arranged to face each other in an opposed manner by way of liquid crystal therebetween, a pixel electrode and a counter electrode which generates an electric field between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode are mounted, and the light transmittance of liquid crystal is controlled by a component of the electric field which is parallel to the substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, along with the spreading of portable telephones and portable information terminals, the demand for intermediate-sized or miniaturized liquid crystal display devices of extremely small power consumption has been also increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With respect to the IPS mode liquid crystal display device, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 36058/1995, for example, a method which switches on or off liquid crystal based on a lateral electric field which is generated between metal electrodes constituting different layers byway of an insulation film is most popularly adopted. This structure, however, has a drawback that it is difficult to increase the pixel numerical aperture and hence, the light utilization efficiency is low compared to a usual TN type display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, to compensate for this drawback, it is necessary to increase the brightness of a backlight and hence, it is difficult for such a structure to achieve the low power consumption required by a notebook type personal computer or a portable terminal as a whole LCD module (the structure being referred to as &ldquo;first conventional technique&rdquo; hereinafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, although it is necessary to increase a distance between respective electrodes to increase the numerical aperture in the pixel constitution of the above-mentioned method, a driving voltage is elevated when the distance between electrodes is widened and hence, the power consumption of the driver LSI is increased. Accordingly, it has been difficult for the conventional technique to achieve the low power consumption of the IPS mode LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To solve such a problem, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 316383/1999, for example, discloses a method in which the numerical aperture of the pixel is enhanced by driving liquid crystal based on a fringe electric field which is generated between a planar transparent electrode and a comb-like electrode made of a transparent electrode which is formed as a layer different from the former transparent electrode and above the former transparent layer (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;second conventional technique&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, as a method for reducing a driving voltage, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 148596/1994, for example, discloses a method in which the driving voltage is reduced by providing two transistors which connect liquid crystal driving electrodes to pixels and these transistors are subjected to differential driving (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;third conventional technique&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this third conventional technique, y pieces of gate signal lines and x&plus;1 pieces of drain signal lines are provided to the pixels arranged in a matrix array of y rows and x columns. Accordingly, the drain signal lines are commonly used by a group of pixels which belong to two neighboring columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> First of all, the drawback of the first conventional technique lies, as mentioned previously, in that the increase of the numerical aperture is difficult because of the use of metal electrodes which form different layers by way of the insulation film as the liquid crystal driving electrodes and hence, the low power consumption cannot be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> With respect to the drawback of the second conventional technique, although the second prior art can definitely enhance the numerical aperture, residual images are considerably generated compared to the conventional method and hence, it is difficult to achieve high quality images. Further, since it is necessary to form transparent electrodes which constitute respective layers during steps, the steps become complicated and hence, the reduction of cost is difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With respect to the drawback of the third conventional technique, although the lowering of driving voltage can be achieved at the liquid crystal driving part, it is necessary to perform the conversion of image data in the former stage of the driver LSI such that the differential voltage is supplied between two signal lines and this makes a circuit for conversion complicated and pushes up a manufacturing cost. Further, a dynamic range of voltage in the inside of the conversion circuit is increased to the contrary compared to the usual driving and hence, the power consumption of the conversion circuit is increased whereby it is difficult to achieve the reduction of power consumption of the module as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, it has been difficult for the respective conventional techniques or the combination of these conventional techniques to apply the IPS mode liquid crystal to the equipment which is required to satisfy the low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve these drawbacks of the conventional techniques and it is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display device having a wide viewing angle which is suitably applicable to a notebook type personal computer or a portable terminal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention are explained hereinafter in conjunction with attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> &lt;Constitution of Pixel&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a plan view showing one embodiment of a unit pixel of a liquid crystal display device according to the present invention. A liquid crystal display part of the liquid crystal display device is constituted of a large number of pixels which are arranged in a matrix array and the unit pixel constitutes one of these pixels. Accordingly, the unit pixels which are arranged above and below as well as at left and at right of the unit pixel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also have the same constitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Then, respective right, middle and left views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> respectively show cross-sections taken along a line A-A&prime;, B-B&prime; and C-C&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an equivalent circuit of a pixel array portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The overall constitution of the pixel array portion is formed on a buffer insulation film consisting of a Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having a film thickness of 50 nm and a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a film thickness of 120 nm which is, in turn, formed on an alkalifree glass substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a strain point of 670 degree centigrade. The buffer insulation film plays a role of preventing the diffusion of impurities such as Na and the like from the glass substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> On the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, two polycrystalline Si (hereinafter referred to as poly-Si) films <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a film thickness of 50 nm which correspond to two thin film transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed. On respective poly-Si films <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, scanning wiring electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of Mo are formed by way of a gate insulation film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> made of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Further, a second signal wiring electrode (reference voltage signal line) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed using the same Mo as the scanning wiring electrodes (gate signal lines) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> An interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is formed such that the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> covers the above-mentioned all components. A first signal wiring electrode (drain signal line) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed of a three-layered metal film made of Mo/Al/Mo and a source electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected to source and drain layers formed on portions of one poly-Si layer via contact through holes formed in the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Further, a connection electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed of a three-layered metal film made of Mo/Al/Mo is connected to one source and drain layers formed on portions of the other poly-Si layer and a second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via contact through holes formed in the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A second source electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; formed of a three-layered metal film made of Mo/Al/Mo is connected to the other source and drain layers via contact through holes formed in the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Among the three-layered metal film made of Mo/Al/Mo, the Mo film which constitutes a layer below the Al film is provided for reducing the contact resistance between the poly-Si film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and Al, while the Mo film which constitutes a layer above the Al film is provided for reducing the contact resistance between the source electrodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; and the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> All of these elements are covered with a protective insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>having a film thickness of 400 nm and an organic insulation film (organic protective film) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> containing acrylic resin as a major component and having a film thickness of 2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Further, a first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is connected to the source electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of one thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via a contact through hole formed in the protective insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the organic insulation film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A second pixel electrode (counter electrode) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of ITO is connected to the second source electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the other thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via contact through holes formed in the protective insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the organic insulation film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is a plan view, the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are constituted of comb-shaped electrodes which are meshed with each other. In this case, in a region which is surrounded by the scanning wiring electrodes (gate signal lines) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the first signal wiring electrodes (drain signal lines) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a portion of the region which functions substantially as the pixel region is formed of a portion excluding a periphery of the region (corresponding to an opening portion of a black matrix formed on a liquid-crystal-side surface of the other substrate which faces one substrate in an opposed manner by way of liquid crystal). Accordingly, in the pixel region, the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are alternately arranged in their parallel directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, out of two signal wiring electrodes, the first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed such that the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> crosses the scanning wiring electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, while the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged parallel to the scanning wiring electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A voltage supplied to the first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the first thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a voltage supplied to the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is applied to the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the second thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The liquid crystal is driven by an electric field generated between two pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device having such a constitution, by applying the differential voltages to the first and second signal wiring electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the voltages applied to respective pixel electrodes can be reduced to one half of the voltages required in the usual case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Further, since two pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are constituted of transparent electrodes made of ITO and are formed into comb-shaped electrodes having a width of 4 &mgr;m which are meshed with each other, the driving voltage can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Further, since the electrodes are transparent, the liquid crystal on the electrodes is driven by a fringe electric field within an area extended from an end portion of the electrode to an inner position disposed away from the end portion by 1.5 to 2 &mgr;m and hence, the liquid crystal functions in the same manner as the opening portion. Accordingly, the effective numerical aperture can be enhanced so that the light utilization efficiency is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Due to these advantageous effects, the power consumption of the whole LCD module can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a plan view showing another embodiment of the unit pixel of the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Respective right, middle and left views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> respectively show cross-sections taken along a line A-A&prime;, B-B&prime; and C-C&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an equivalent circuit of the pixel array portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Various types of film materials and their laminated structures used in this embodiment are similar to those of the embodiment 1. Further, this embodiment is similar to the embodiment 1 also with respect to the constitution that the voltage supplied to the first signal wiring electrode (drain signal line) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the first thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the voltage supplied to the second signal wiring electrode (reference voltage signal line) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is applied to the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the second thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the constitution that pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are constituted of transparent electrodes made of ITO and are formed into comb-shaped electrodes having a width of 4 &mgr;m which are meshed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this embodiment differs from the embodiment 1 in that the second signal wiring electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are arranged approximately parallel to the first signal wiring electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, a member which corresponds to the connection electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the embodiment 1 is used as the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is extended in the direction parallel to the first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Here, the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged as a layer below one electrode out of the comb-shaped second pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Due to such an arrangement, out of the through holes for connecting the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connection electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are necessary in the embodiment 1, one through hole can be eliminated so that the numerical aperture can be enhanced. Further, by arranging the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the layer below one electrode out of the comb-shaped second pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the lowering of the numerical aperture due to the presence of the opaque second signals wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> When the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is extended parallel to the scanning wiring electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the capacitance of the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes a sum of charge holding capacitance of all pixels connected to the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the capacitance of the liquid crystal layer and hence, the capacitance of the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes an extremely large value. When the resistance value of the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not sufficiently small, there arises a possibility that shadow wing in the lateral direction is generated due to the delay of signal thus giving rise to poor image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, in the second embodiment, the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged such that the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is extended in the direction parallel to the first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the capacitance per a single piece of second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes a sum of a crossing capacitance between a common electrode (second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and a scanning electrode (scanning wiring electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), a charge holding capacitance for selected one pixel and a capacitance of the liquid crystal layer and hence, the capacitance per a single piece of second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes a small value compared to the former value. Accordingly, the above-mentioned drawback on the image quality derived from the delay of signals is not generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a plan view showing another embodiment of the unit pixel of the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Respective right, middle and left views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> respectively show cross-sections taken along a line A-A&prime;, B-B&prime; and C-C&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an equivalent circuit of a pixel array portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Various types of film materials and their laminated structures used in this embodiment are substantially similar to those of the embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are directly connected to each other and a thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not inserted between them. By using only one piece of thin film transistor which is formed in the pixel, an area occupied by the thin film transistor can be reduced so that the numerical aperture of pixels can be increased. Further, even when such a constitution is adopted, by applying a differential voltage between the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is possible to obtain the driving voltage reduction effect in the same manner as the embodiments 1 and 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> As a driving method, it is possible to use either one of a frame inversion driving which inverts the polarity of voltage every 1 frame period and a line inversion driving which inverts the polarity of voltage every 1 scanning period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Further, this embodiment is similar to the embodiment 1 with respect to the constitution that two pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are constituted of transparent electrodes made of ITO and are formed into comb-shaped electrodes having a width of 4 &mgr;m which are meshed with each other. Accordingly, this embodiment can realize the enhancement of numerical aperture and the reduction of driving voltage power source in the same manner as the embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> By using the poly-Si thin film transistor having the large driving ability as the thin film transistor for driving pixel as in the case of this embodiment, the thin film transistor can be miniaturized and hence, the numerical aperture of the pixel can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a plan view showing another embodiment of the unit pixel of the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Respective right, middle and left views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> respectively show cross-sections taken along a line A-A&prime;, B-B&prime; and C-C&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an equivalent circuit of a pixel array portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Various types of film materials and their laminated structures used in this embodiment are substantially similar to those of the embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, in the same manner as the embodiment 3, the second signal wiring electrode (reference voltage signal line) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second pixel electrode (counter electrode) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are directly connected to each other and a thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not inserted between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> However, here, the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged approximately parallel to the first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Due to such an arrangement, out of through holes which connect the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connection electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, one through hole can be eliminated and hence, the numerical aperture can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Further, by arranging the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the layer below one electrode out of the comb-shaped second pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the lowering of the numerical aperture due to the presence of the opaque second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be minimized. Still further, since the thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not present between the second signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the numerical aperture can be further enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> This embodiment can obtain the largest numerical aperture among all of the embodiments described heretofore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Further, this embodiment can obtain the driving voltage reduction effect as that of the embodiment 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> As a driving method, it is possible to use either one of a frame inversion driving which inverts the polarity of voltage every 1 frame period and a column inversion driving which inverts the polarity of voltage every 1 frame period but applies a voltage of an inverse polarity to the neighboring first signal wiring electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a plan view showing another embodiment of the unit pixel of the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Respective right, middle and left views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> respectively show cross-sections taken along a line A-A&prime;, B-B&prime; and C-C&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Various types of film materials and their laminated structures used in this embodiment are similar to those of the embodiment 1. Further, this embodiment is similar to the embodiment 1 also with respect to the constitution that the voltage supplied to the first signal wiring electrode (drain signal line) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the first thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a voltage supplied to the second signal wiring electrode (reference voltage signal line) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is applied to the second pixel electrode (counter electrode) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the second thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the constitution that pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are constituted of transparent electrodes made of ITO and are formed into comb-shaped electrodes having a width of 4 &mgr;m which are meshed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is characterized in that the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; which reflects light is arranged as a layer below the comb-shaped electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> constituting the display region which are meshed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; is formed by extending the second source electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; in the embodiment 1 over the whole area of the pixel region. Accordingly, the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; can have a potential equal to that of the second pixel electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Further, with respect to the constitution on the surface of the reflection portion, only the upper layer made of Mo is eliminated from the second source electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; constituted of a three-layered film made of Mo/Al/Mo. Due to such a constitution, the light reflectance on the surface of the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; can be largely increased from 40% to 90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the image display is obtained by reflecting the external light on the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Further, the liquid crystal is driven by the lateral electric field formed between two pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the fringe electric field formed between the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Also in the previously-mentioned second conventional technique (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 316383/1999), there is disclosed the lateral-electric-field type liquid crystal display device which uses the planar transparent electrodes and the comb-shaped electrodes made of transparent electrodes which are formed as a layer different from and above the planar transparent electrodes. However, in the conventional technique, an equal potential is applied to all comb-shaped electrodes and only the electric field which is generated between the planar electrodes and the comb-shaped electrodes is utilized. This embodiment differs from such conventional technique in that two comb-shaped electrodes which are meshed with each other are used and the liquid crystal is driven by both of the electric field generated between two opposing comb-shaped electrodes and the fringe electric field generated between one of the comb-shaped electrodes and the reflection electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Due to such a constitution, the more uniform electric field can be applied between two comb-shaped electrodes and hence, it is possible to obtain favorable display images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a plan view showing another embodiment of the unit pixel of the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Respective right, middle and left views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> respectively show cross-sections taken along a line A-A&prime;, B-B&prime; and C-C&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, various types of film materials and their laminated structures used in this embodiment are similar to those of the embodiment 1. Further, this embodiment is similar to the embodiment 1 also with respect to the constitution that the voltage supplied to the first signal wiring electrode (drain signal line) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the first pixel electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the first thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a voltage supplied to the second signal wiring electrode (reference voltage signal line) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is applied to a second pixel electrode (counter electrode) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the second thin film transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the constitution that two pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are constituted of transparent electrodes made of ITO and are formed into comb-shaped electrodes having a width of 4 &mgr;m which are meshed with each other. </paragraph>

The reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; has the same layer structure as that of the embodiment 5 and only differs from the embodiment with respect to the constitution that the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; is formed extending over approximately half of the pixel region. That is, the reflection display region and the transmission display region are constituted by the region where the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; is formed and the other remaining region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The image display is performed by reflecting the external light by the reflection electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; in the reflection display mode and by utilizing light from the backlight in the transmission display mode. The transmission and reflection display principles are those which have been described heretofore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The partial reflection/transmission type display device is suitable for a miniaturized equipment such as a portable telephone, a portable terminal or the like which is popularly used outdoors. With the use of the pixel structure of the present invention, the driving voltage can be reduced so that the equipment of low power consumption can be realized. Further, since the equipment can obtain the wide viewing angle which is the feature of the lateral electric field driving method, it is possible to obtain the favorable image display. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Although such a constitution is disadvantageous in view of the numerical aperture since the number of thin film transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inside of the pixel becomes four, when the voltage value which generates the peak brightness differs between the reflection mode and the transmission mode, the constitution is advantageous to obtain the favorable images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Although this embodiment is constituted such that the thin film transistors Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are interposed between the second signal wiring electrode (reference voltage signal line) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second or the fourth pixel electrode (counter voltage) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it is needless to say that these thin film transistors Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are eliminated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In such a case, by adopting the constitutions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, by connecting the thin film transistors to a pair of respective pixel electrodes of the reflection part and the transmission part and by applying the optimal voltages to these pixel electrodes respectively, it is possible to obtain the favorable display characteristics. </paragraph>

The circuit is a dynamic circuit which is constituted of the N-type thin film transistors and bootstrap capacitance Cb and is driven based on a reference potential Vss, a start signal Vin, a clock pulse voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a clock pulse voltage V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is complementary with the clock pulse voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The circuit is not provided with a power source voltage supply wiring which is usually necessary for the CMOS circuit and hence, the circuit is operated using the charge supplied from the complementary clock voltages of V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, there exists no penetration current from the power source wiring to the grand wiring which causes a problem in a shift register circuit using an inverter circuit which is constituted of the N-type transistors and a load. Accordingly, the power consumption of the driving circuits can be reduced. Further, since the circuit is constituted of only the N-type thin film transistors, the manufacturing process is simplified compared to the manufacturing process of the circuit constituted of CMOS so that the circuit can be manufactured at a low cost. </paragraph>

Since the output of one driver LSI is divided into a plurality of signal wirings due to the horizontal-circuit-side switching circuit SW, the number of output pins of the driver LSI can be reduced.
