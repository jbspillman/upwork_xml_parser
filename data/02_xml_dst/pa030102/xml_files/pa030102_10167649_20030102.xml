<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a solar cell formed on a semiconductor substrate and a method of producing the same, and particularly to improvements in a solar cell formed on a thin semiconductor substrate liable to fracture and in a method of producing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor silicon substrate for a solar cell is cut out from a monocrystalline or polycrystalline semiconductor ingot to a thickness of about 300 to 350 &mgr;m, using an inner-edge slicer, an outer-edge slicer, a wire saw, or the like. In producing the solar cell, a pn junction for causing photoelectric conversion is formed in the silicon substrate, and then an anti-reflection coating for increasing light entrance into the substrate, an electrode for efficiently extracting photoelectric conversion current, and the like are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C, an example of a conventional solar cell is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</cross-reference> shows a front surface provided as a light-receiving face of the cell, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</cross-reference> shows a back surface of the same, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</cross-reference> shows a cross-section taken along a line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>X-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>X in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</cross-reference>. When producing such a conventional solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, any damaged layer caused by slicing off a silicon wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is initially removed from the wafer by alkaline etching. An n-type impurity is then applied on a surface of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a pn junction is formed near the light-receiving face side by thermal diffusion. On the light-receiving face side of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an anti-reflection coating (not shown) is formed with plasma CVD (chemical vapor deposition), and on the back surface, a backside collector electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed by printing and baking aluminum paste with a screen process. Further, by printing and baking silver paste with the screen process, a comb-like collector electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on the light-receiving face side of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a connection electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is formed on the back surface. The surfaces of electrodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>composed of baked silver are coated with solder layers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>by dip soldering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, interconnectors made of conductive metal bands are connected between solar cells, to fabricate a solar battery module including several tens of solar cells. In the solar battery module, a glass plate is joined with transparent resin to the front side of the several tens of solar cells arranged in an array, and then an insulating film, a moisture-proof film and the like are provided on the backside. Terminals for externally extracting electric current are drawn from both ends of a solar cell circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce cost for such a solar battery module, it is necessary to make thinner semiconductor silicon substrates which account for a large part of the cost, so as to reduce usage of expensive silicon material. If silicon substrates are made thinner, however, fracture of solar cells will increase in production process of the solar cells and modules, resulting in lower production yield. That is, this will not necessarily lead to cost reduction. In addition, if the solar cells are made thinner, the fracture of the same will be liable to occur, for example, due to temperature cycles experienced during use of the completed solar battery modules, and hence the quality and reliability of the modules may be lowered. Therefore, the silicon substrates in the conventional mass-produced solar cells generally have a thickness of about 300 to 350 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In other words, if silicon wafers cut out from a silicon ingot are made thinner, invisibly small cracks, flaws or chips will be liable to occur in edge portions of the wafers in production processes of the silicon substrates, the solar cells and the solar battery modules. Originating from those defects, larger cracks or fractures are likely to be developed. Fractures in the silicon substrates during the manufacturing process of the modules cause loss of substrate material, replacement of the cracked substrates and need for additional work for removing cracked pieces from manufacturing apparatus. As a result, the cost of the solar cells and the modules will be increased. In particular, if a solar cell substrate (a wafer) fractures during production of the solar battery module, the entire module will be defective and resulting in larger loss. Even if the solar battery module is flawless immediately after its completion, fractures may likely be caused later in the cells, for example, by temperature cycles during use of the module in the case that the solar cell substrates are thin. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A possible mechanism that causes fracture in a silicon wafer or a solar cell is thought as follows. Small cracks, flaws or chips are produced in silicon wafer edge portions during manufacturing processes of silicon wafers, solar cells and solar battery modules. In various process steps of the wafer or the cell in the production process of the module, those defective portions are subject to excessive stress and will develop to fractures. In particular, the cell edge portion is subject to large stress (antiplane shear stress, in particular) in assembling of the solar battery module, because of soldering of interconnectors made of metal having a considerably different thermal expansion coefficient from that of the solar cell. Here, if the cell contains a minute crack or the like, stress will be concentrated at such a local portion to develop the crack, finally causing cell fracture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this case, stress concentration at such local portions can be reduced by reinforcing the cell edge with a reinforcing material. Accordingly, the reinforcing material is required to have a property to set the minute crack in the cell edge so that the antiplane shear stress imposed thereto can be alleviated. Therefore, a strong material having a large adhesive strength and a large modulus of longitudinal elasticity is desirable. Moreover, it is desirable that such a reinforcing material can be applied on the solar cell without increasing the production steps of the cell, in view of cost. Examples of specific reinforcing methods are as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> 1. The back surface side not contributing to photoelectric conversion of the solar cell wafer is reinforced by resin. The reinforcing material bears any load imposed in handling the wafer. Thus, fracture of the solar cell wafer is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 2. A buffering material is provided on the side surface portion of the solar cell wafer so that the load is not directly imposed thereto in handling during the production process. Thus, the solar cell wafer is prevented from fracture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 3. A resin having a high adhesive strength is injected into gaps of flaws or cracks present in peripheral portions of the solar cell wafer. Thus, flaws and cracks are prevented from developing to fractures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.

Solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Formed on the front surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a conventional comb-shaped silver electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for collecting current. The back surface of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is covered with a backside aluminum electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. A peripheral portion on the back surface of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reinforced with resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Solar cells usually have a thickness of about 350 &mgr;m. However, thinner solar cells have been desired in order to increase the number of cell substrates obtainable from an ingot for reducing cost. Cell fracture during production process has not been a serious problem for cell substrates having the thickness of about 350 &mgr;m. However, when solar cells are made thinner in order to increase the number of wafers obtainable from an ingot, ratio of the fracture occurrence increases dramatically. As such, it is expected that the present invention is more effective particularly in thinner solar cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The size of the solar cell&apos;s main surface is usually about 10 cm square or larger. Cost reduction for the solar cell can be achieved also by making larger the dimension of the main surface thereof. In contrast, as the solar cell is made thinner and as the area of the main surface thereof is made larger, the solar cell is more likely to fracture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reinforced with resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the back surface thereof. This will have an effect of increasing cell strength against thermal stress or external mechanical force imposed thereto during the production process of the solar battery module. As the back surface side of the solar cell does not require transparency, resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be opaque and then an appropriate kind of reinforcing resin can be selected in view of its workability and cost. When external force is imposed to solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the harder the reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is, the larger load will be born by the reinforcing material. Therefore, hard material (having high elastic modulus) is desired for reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, the reinforcing material of harder property tends to easily achieve the effect of reinforcing even when it is made thin. Here, it goes without saying that, reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be provided to a wider area on the back surface of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> than shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or to the entire back surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> back surface of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to another embodiment of the present invention is shown, in which a resin-reinforcing portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is limited to vicinities of two sides opposing to each other on the back surface of the cell. Usually, opposing two sides of the cell are subject to external force in the production processes of the solar cell and the solar battery module. Instead of reinforcing the vicinity of the entire peripheral edge on the back surface of the cell as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, therefore, by reinforcing the vicinities of only two sides readily subject to external force, a similar effect can be obtained. In addition, in positioning or handling the solar cell in the production process of the solar battery module, the reinforcing material provided to portions where the cell is in contact with a jig is expected to be effective as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the examples of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in order to increase the strength of reinforcing resin material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to obtain higher elastic modulus, glass fiber, carbon fiber or the like may be mixed in the resin. Selection of a material with higher elastic modulus for a reinforcing material is expected to contribute to higher effect of preventing cell fracture. When it is difficult to obtain high elasticity only with resin, addition of reinforcing fibers is particularly expected to enhance the effect. Moreover, improvement in thermal resistance can also be expected, depending on a type of reinforcing fiber material to be added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As glass fiber and carbon fiber has higher elastic moduli than silicon, those reinforcing fibers can bear larger stress when external force is imposed to the solar cell. Therefore, the load is less likely to be imposed to the cell, and reinforcement for the cell will be effectively improved. If a fiber material with high thermal resistance is mixed in the reinforcing material, the effect of reinforcing the cell will be maintained or improved even in an environment of high temperature in the production processes of the solar cell and the module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> transparent reinforcing material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided in a vicinity of a peripheral edge on a front side of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The reinforcing material such as transparent resin or glass can reinforce the front surface side, not limited to the back surface side of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It goes without saying that reinforcement on the back surface side of the cell as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> can be combined with that on the front surface side as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C show a further embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows a front surface, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows a side surface, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows a back surface, of a solar cell. In this embodiment, a buffering material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided on the side surface side portion of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When buffering material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided on the side surface portion of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, damage to silicon substrate la due to concentration of external force to one point of the cell can be prevented in positioning or carrying the cell in the production process of the solar battery module. That is, use of a flexible material for buffering material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will serve to distribute the external force even if it is imposed on one point of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, fracture of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be less likely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show a still further embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a back surface of a solar cell, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows an enlarged view of an encircled region <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, a liquid reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is introduced and then cure in a flaw or cracked portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a peripheral edge of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and thus the flaw or crack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is joined and reinforced. When reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is introduced in flaw or crack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for joint, the effect of reinforcement thereof is achieved by its adhesive strength, not by an influence of strength of reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>itself. Therefore, reinforcement is effective even if thickness of reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is small, and thus the thickness itself is not significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition, as reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in this example does not need to be thick, occurrence of thermal stress is almost negligible, which is due to a mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient of reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>itself relative to silicon or other materials constituting the solar battery module. Even if flaw or crack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is too small to be visually recognized, not the entire solar cell but such a weak portion can be selectively reinforced. This is achieved by utilizing the property of the liquid reinforcing material with wettability and surface tension to easily reach a small gap. For reinforcement in this application, therefore, reinforcing material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having properties of small viscosity, good fluidity, easy permeation to a small gap before curing and high adhesive strength can achieve the significant effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C show a still further embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a front surface, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows a side surface, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> shows a back surface, of a solar cell. In this embodiment, reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided in vicinities of peripheral edge portions on both front and back sides of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, warp of the cell will not be large even in an environment at a high or low temperature. That is, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C, warp of the cell due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between the solar cell and the reinforcing material can be made smaller than in the case of providing the reinforcing material on only either one of the front and back surfaces of the solar cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, similarly as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is provided in vicinities of opposing two sides on a back surface of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, however, reinforcing material region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the back surface of the cell is patterned so that thermal stress due to the difference of thermal expansion property between solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>can be made smaller. In other words, since the thermal stress due to the difference of thermal expansion property between cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>becomes larger as the reinforcing material region is longer, reinforcing material region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>can be patterned so as to reduce the thermal stress without lowering the effect of reinforcing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C show a still further embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows a front surface, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows a side surface, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference> shows a back surface, of a solar cell. In this embodiment, a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reinforced by an aluminum plate, a ceramic plate or the like <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> joined with resin or the like <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in vicinities of opposing two sides on the back surface of the cell. Such a reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be joined slightly beyond the opposing two sides of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, fracture of the cell can effectively be avoided by preventing the cell from directly abutting a jig during the production processes of the solar cell and the module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C, an effect of reinforcing the solar cell can be enhanced by further reinforcement with aluminum plate, ceramic plate or the like <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in addition to reinforcement with resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. When an edge portion of reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extends slightly beyond and is joined to the opposing two sides of cell substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the jig will directly abut not on cell substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>but on reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, for example in positioning cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the production process of the solar battery module. Thus, fracture of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Moreover, when conductive resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and metal reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are used, an effect of lowering electrical resistance of the backside electrode of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be obtained, and thus electrical output of the solar battery module can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> show a still further embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows a side surface and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> show a back surface of a solar cell. In this embodiment, a vicinity of each of opposing two sides on a back surface of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reinforced with a conductive resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and a metal plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> joined thereto. Here, metal plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a solderable reinforcing plate. In the solar battery module including a plurality of solar cells <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reinforced in such a manner, adjacent cells are electrically connected by interconnectors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. That is, interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> soldered to metal reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of one solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to a comb-shaped electrode on the front side of adjacent solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, at a connection portion of interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> made of copper band, thermal stress due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between the copper band <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, solder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as well as thermal stress imposed to the connection portion due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between a material composing the solar battery module and the solar cell has caused fracture in the solar cell in some cases. In the present embodiment, however, as conductive reinforcing materials <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, 7 are used at the interconnector connection portion, such cell fracture can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> vicinity of a peripheral edge on a back surface of a solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reinforced with a silver electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An interconnector is connected to a connection region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the silver electrode region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by soldering. Since silver electrode region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has small electrical resistance and can have the surface solder-plated, it is expected that resistance of the backside electrode can be effectively lowered and electrical property of the solar battery module can be simultaneously improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in addition to the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the peripheral edge portion of a back surface of a solar cell is further reinforced by a metal reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. That is, this metal reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to silver electrode region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by soldering. It goes without saying that such a reinforcing plate may be provided to the entire back surface of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, since the interconnector is soldered to metal reinforcing plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the solar cell substrate will not be subject to thermal stress due to soldering or load via the interconnector from a module constituting portion. Thus, damage to the cell can be reduced, and reliability thereof can be improved. </paragraph>

In other words, pn junction is easily isolated at the peripheral edge portion of the wafer by providing glass reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in a step prior to forming the pn junction and backside electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and improvement in electrical output of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be achieved.

When it is difficult to precisely arrange solar cells in position, the cells can be arranged abutting each other, if a non-conductive reinforcing or buffering material is provided on the side surface of each solar cell.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Since reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is formed with baked silver similarly as connection electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on the cell back surface, silver paste for them can simultaneously be printed and baked with screen process, and the effect of reinforcing the cell can be achieved without adding any process step. Specifically, reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and backside connection electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>were printed to a thickness of about 30 &mgr;m using silver paste and a screen of SUS165 mesh. A pattern of baked silver was formed by baking silver paste print at about 600&deg; C. after drying at about 150&deg; C. Thereafter, the surface of baked silver was coated with solder layer by dip soldering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>B, reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>was printed so as to overlay the peripheral edge portion of backside collector electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed with baked aluminum. In this way, since reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is of baked silver, in addition to the effect of reinforcing, an effect of lowering electrical resistance in a direction parallel to the back surface of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also achieved. Therefore, when a plurality of cells are connected in series, output property (particularly, FF: fill factor) of the cells can be improved, compared with a conventional example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Although an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is different in that reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is formed not only on the peripheral edge portion of backside collector electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>but also overlaid on the peripheral edge portion of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Since joint portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the baked silver reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and silicon wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has high joint strength, stronger reinforcement can be obtained effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, if an overlapping width <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and aluminum collector electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is too large, separation is likely at an interface between baked silver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and baked aluminum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>after dip soldering. When width <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was 8 mm, separation was observed in 7 solar cells out of 10 at the interface between baked silver and baked aluminum. When width <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was 5 mm, separation was observed in 2 cells out of 10. When width <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was 4 mm, separation was not observed in any cell. In other words, in order to obtain stable effect of reinforcing, width <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is desirably 4 mm or smaller. In the present embodiment, the width was set to 1.5 mm. Here, separation was not observed in any out of 100 solar cells produced for trial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, if a distance <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>from the peripheral edge of silicon wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to that of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is too small, leakage current is liable to increase in the peripheral edge portion of solar cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Leakage current Id of a conventional solar cell was about 0.1A while Id was increased to about 0.3A when distance <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>was set to 0.2 mm. When distance <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>was set to 0.5 mm, Id was about 0.1A similarly as in a conventional example. That is, in order to obtain the effect of reinforcing the cell without lowering electric property of the cell, distance <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is desirably 0.5 mm or larger. In the present embodiment, the distance was set to 1.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> back surface of a solar cell according to a still further embodiment is shown, in which baked silver reinforcement portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is limited to vicinities of two sides opposing each other on the cell back surface. In the production process of the solar battery module, a cell edge portion is subject to large stress due to soldering of the interconnector made of metal having a thermal expansion coefficient considerably different from that of the solar cell. Therefore, cell fracture is liable to occur mainly along a direction of interconnector connection. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, sufficient reinforcement effect can be obtained even if only two sides where cell fracture is liable to occur are provided with reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. In such a case, usage of expensive silver paste can be reduced, and reinforcement can be obtained with low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Although an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</cross-reference> is similar to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, an interconnector is provided to the solar cell in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</cross-reference>. In this case, an interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not only connected to backside connection electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, but also electrically connected to connection portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Since baked silver reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>can serve also as a collector electrode, output property (FF) of the cell can be improved by connecting interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> also to baked silver pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a module was produced, in which reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are electrically connected by soldering, and 54 cells are serially connected.

When soldering interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, stress is concentrated at connection portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and cell fracture is liable to originate therefrom. By distributing stress with connection portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> being widened as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>B, therefore, output property (FF) in the module state can be improved with interconnector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> being connected while preventing cell fracture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows an example of dip soldering step for the solar cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. In the dip soldering step of this solar cell, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is once immersed in molten solder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in a solder bath <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and then pulled up vertically as shown with an arrow <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the dip soldering step, the cell provided with baked silver reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is liable to have solder accumulation <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on reinforcing material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a vicinity of the bottom side relative to the pull-up direction. If solder accumulation <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is produced, cell fracture is more likely to occur originating therefrom. Solder accumulation <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is produced because molten solder flows in large amount from the top to bottom along the pull-up direction. </paragraph>

Discontinuity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can retard solder flow into the bottom side of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Consequently, solder accumulation can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>B, two discontinuities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided at both end portions of the bottom side of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, solder flow to the bottom side of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>can be made smaller, and solder accumulation is less likely to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>C, two discontinuities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are provided along diagonals of rectangular cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at both end portions of the bottom side of reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> show a back surface of a solar cell according to a still further embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, instead of providing a discontinuity in reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, a comb-teeth pattern is provided in an area where solder accumulation tends to occur, so as to prevent solder accumulation. In this case, since it is not necessary to form a discontinuity in baked silver reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, effect of lowering resistance as well as effect of reinforcing is not decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows another example of a dip soldering step for the solar cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, by pulling up rectangular cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the cell diagonally tilted, molten solder flow can be gathered at a corner thereof on any reinforcing material pattern. Since gathered solder is less likely to accumulate at the corner of the cell, solder accumulation on reinforcing material pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, occurrence of cell fracture due to external load can be decreased by reinforcing solar cell substrates. Thus, ratio of cell fracture in a production process of the solar cells can be lowered, and an availability factor of an apparatus for producing the cells can be improved. In addition, by suppressing cell fracture occurrence, it becomes possible to reduce work for cleaning the production apparatus as well as cost for the solar cells and modules improving use efficiency of material. Thus, performance and reliability of the completed solar battery modules can be improved. </paragraph>
