<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally directed to an apparatus and processes thereof for the preparation of particulate materials with narrow particle size distribution properties. More specifically, the present invention relates to improved classifier chamber geometries, such as a reduced or variable fine particle outlet diameter, and which diameters enable a high level of control over the physics of the separation process in the classifier, such as the particle size and quality of the particle separation, and thereby provides unexpected and superior particle size separation quality in a classifier. Furthermore the present invention provides the componentry and a method for making a convenient retrofit or adaptation of an existing conventional classifier apparatus to provide the advantages of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In particle processing arts, for example, for the preparation of fine and uniformly disperse particulate materials, there exists various equipment and mechanical processes for achieving selective separation of particulate powders into eligible and non-eligible particle size fractions or ranges, and are collectively referred to as classifiers and classification equipment and processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of particulate powders, such as electrostatographic toner compositions, a classifier apparatus employing a rotating wheel is commonly used to accomplish classification. In general, the rapidly rotating classifier wheel creates a dynamical fluid vortex which provides the necessary forces to achieve separation of particles greater than a certain size from particles less than a certain size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The extent or sharpness of the separation of particles of different sizes achieved by the classifier is an important measure of the quality of the separation equipment and process, and is generally reflected in the quality of the resultant particles, for example, the physical performance characteristics and properties of the particles. The sharpness of the separation is also a measure of how well the classifier can discriminate among similarly sized particles. Ideally, a classifier will separate a feed particle stream containing a mixture of fine and coarse particles sizes into two distinct streams: a coarse stream and a fines stream with little or no overlap in size distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The degree of sharpness of the separation is measured, for example, using a coarse grade efficiency calculation. The calculation indicates what fraction of particles with a certain size will travel to the coarse stream, and what fraction will travel to the fines stream. A ratio of the size at which 25 percent of the particles travel to the coarse stream (D<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>) and the size at which 75 percent of the particles travel to the coarse stream (D<highlight><subscript>75</subscript></highlight>) is used as a nominal measure of sharpness (D<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>/D<highlight><subscript>75</subscript></highlight>). An ideal separation provides a sharpness (D<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>/D<highlight><subscript>75</subscript></highlight>) equal to 1. In currently available commercial classification equipment, a sharpness index exceeding a value of 0.7, for example, from about 0.7 to about 1.0, is considered to be excellent and considered difficult to attain without exceptional effort and operating conditions. Other classification metrics include (D<highlight><subscript>84</subscript></highlight>/D<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>) which is referred to as Upper Geometric Size Distribution (UGSD). This metric is determined from the fines stream of a certain volume median and distribution resulting from the separation and is a good indicator of separation sharpness. In general, the lower the Upper Geometric Size Distribution for a certain volume median size, the higher the sharpness index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Commercially available classifier wheels generally provide little or no profiling, or only provide a profile which maintains a constant wheel height or constant air flow radial velocity. These conditions typically result in a particle cut point situation which diminishes towards the particle outlet, and is believed to lead to an undesirable buildup of solids concentration in the free vortex region. This buildup of solids concentration in the free vortex region is believed to have a detrimental effect on the sharpness index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention in embodiments overcomes these and other problems encountered in the prior art. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Commonly owned and assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,927,510, to Leute, et al., issued Jul. 27, 1999, discloses an apparatus for the classification of solid particulates entrained in a fluid, comprising: a housing provided with a feed inlet, a fine fraction outlet, and a coarse fraction outlet; and a classifier wheel having an upper and lower surface, and a plurality of blade vanes connecting the upper surface to the lower surface at the peripheral edges of the upper and lower surfaces, and wherein the wheel has a constant cut point geometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,481, issued Sep. 14, 1993, to Nied, discloses a vertical air separator with a rotating separator wheel upon which separating air loaded with fine goods flowing from outside towards the inside impinges, from which the separating air axially flows off through an outlet connection pipe in order to be guided to its further use, e.g. in a filter or the like, the separating wheel being provided with a down stream cover plate and a second cover plate being axially distance therefrom, and blades being disposed between the two cover plates at their periphery, and the outlet connection delivery end averted from the separating wheel emptying into an outlet chamber the cross section of which is distinctly larger than the cross section of the said outlet connection pipe so that there occurs an abrupt change of the cross section between the outlet connection pipe and the outlet chamber. A constant radial velocity wheel is described, wherein the airflow velocity is constant regardless of the radial position in the wheel, reference col. 7, lines 21-32. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,377,843, to Schumacher, issued Jan. 3, 1995, discloses a classifying wheel for a centrifugal-wheel air classifier, through which the classifying air flows from outside to the inside against its centrifugal action. The wheel has blades arranged in a ring extending parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel. The blades are positioned between a circular disc carrying the classifying wheel hub and an annular cover disc. The classifying wheel is entirely made in one piece and of a wear-resistant sintered material. The flow channels of the classifying wheel are formed by the surfaces of the classifying wheel blades extending parallel to each other and in direction of the axis of rotation of the wheel. The cut point of the fine product can be precisely controlled by varying the rotational speed of the turbine. This maintenance free design produces unmatched sharpness in cut size. The lack of internal seals makes oversize &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; impossible and allows air flows to be maximized resulting in extremely high product yields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,095, to Martin, issued Nov. 22, 1994, discloses an air classification system comprised of dual cylindrical chambers mechanically separated, to allow a zone of atmospheric air in between. A primary classification chamber is situated vertically below a concentric secondary classification chamber. A rotating parallel blade turbine is situated within the lower primary chamber in order to effect centrifugal particle classification upon a feed material intimately mixed in an air stream. A tubular rotary discharge connected to the turbine which passes through the zone of atmospheric air separating the dual chambers, and extends into the upper secondary chamber which exits to collect and discharge the classified product from the system. A classifier of this design is capable of separating ultra fine particles without stray amounts of oversize with extremely high fine product yields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned references are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the particle separation and classification processes of the prior art, various significant problems exist, for example, difficulties in predicting or controlling both the particle size and particle size distribution of the particulate products produced. Other disadvantages associated with the prior art methods for separating particulate materials are that they typically provide products with highly variable particle size and or particle size distribution properties. These and other disadvantages are avoided, or minimized with the apparatus and processes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus, there remains a need for particle separation apparatus and processes, which provide for the simple and inexpensive preparation, separation, and classification of the particulate material, for example, pigmented resin particles used in dry toner and liquid ink applications. Practitioners in the art have long sought an inexpensive, efficient and environmentally efficacious means for producing narrow particle size distributions using conventional classification and separation equipment, having operator controllable or selectable particle size and particle size distribution properties. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section profile of an exemplary variable or adjustable diameter or iris-type opening high spin vortex ring insert article. The adjustable diameter iris-type opening article can further include a raised lip or chamfer (not shown) similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The iris-type opening is analogous to those found in, for example, light lens cameras and can be constructed by, for example, adapting any known and commercially available iris valve to the ring insert article of the present invention, including, for example, overlapping adjustable panels or petals (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), and a recessed adjustment set screw (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) which engages a main diameter planetary adjust gear (<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section view of the variable or adjustable diameter or iris-type opening high spin vortex ring insert article of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> including the overlapping adjustable panels (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), and a recessed adjustment set screw (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) which engages a diameter planetary adjust gear (<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a view of an exemplary centrifugal variable diameter opening high spin vortex ring insert article (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) of the present invention. The article (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is affixed to the opening (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) of the wheel (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and which opening (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) increases its diameter, for example, proportionately as the classifier wheel speed increases. Thus, for example, when the rotational speed of the drive shaft (<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>) or comparable drive means and consequently the classifier wheel (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is low, the diameter of the fine particle outlet or fines opening (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) is relatively small, or alternatively, the smallest. When the rotational speed of the wheel (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is high the diameter of the opening is comparatively relatively large (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) or increases to an equilibrium diameter. In embodiments, for example, the variable opening can be bounded by one or more spring members (<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) which are centrifugally sensitive to the rotational velocity of the classifier wheel and the affixed vortex ring (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). The springs compress in accordance and in proportion to the resultant centrifugal force exerted thereon and thereby permits a larger effective opening diameter. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> there is illustrated a bottom view of the centrifugally variable diameter opening high spin vortex ring insert article (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) of companion <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The aforementioned equilibrium opening diameter is illustrated as the balance point between the centrifugal forces acting on the small (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> phantom lines) vortex ring opening and large (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) vortex ring opening and the opposing forces from springs (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) which result, respectively, in slow or small diameter opening (<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> phantom lines) and fast or large diameter opening (<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, conversely, illustrates a view of an &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; centrifugally variable diameter opening high spin vortex ring insert article where, for example, when the rotational speed of the wheel drive shaft (not shown) or comparable drive means, and consequently the classifier wheel (not shown) is low, the diameter of the fine particle outlet or fines opening is relatively large, for example (<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>). When the rotational speed of the wheel is high the diameter of the opening is comparatively relatively small, for example (<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>). In embodiments, for example, the variable opening can be bounded by one or more reciprocating lever or spring members (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) attached to dense weighted member (<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>) which is centrifugally sensitive to the rotational velocity of the classifier wheel and can be forced outward or away from the classifier wheel rotational axis in response to an increase in wheel speed and the resultant centrifugal force exerted thereon causing less dense counterweight member(s) (<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>) to move inward toward the classifier wheel rotational axis and to contact the vortex ring opening thereby causing a contraction of the outlet in vortex ring and a smaller effective opening or diameter with an increase in the rotational velocity of the classifier wheel. Conversely, as the classifier wheel turns more slowly the contracted vortex ring (<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>) expands to expanded vortex ring (<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>) to enlarge its effective diameter in proportion to the wheel speed. In the foregoing variable diameter embodiments mentioned above it is readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the area between the periphery of the insert article and the variable diameter vortex ring can be, for example, any suitable material such as flexible metal, plastic, rubber, and the like sheeting material which can accommodate the change in diameter of the vortex ring article opening. Similarly, when the vortex ring article employs a lip or rim structure or chamfer as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the lip or rim structure can be constructed of a suitable material to permit the lip or rim structure to expand or contract proportionately to the change in the ring diameter, for example, a slidable hollow ring which permits partial collapse of the ring upon or within itself. </paragraph>

The relationship between wheel speed and particle product volume median diameter appears to be approximately inverse, that is, as the wheel speed increases the fines volume median cut decreases in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a graphical representation of the relationship between the normalized differential volume distribution and the volume median or diameter of the separated particles. Solid line curve (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) represents the fine particle material obtained from a AFG Model Alpine 200 fluidized jet mill. Dashed line curve (<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>) represents the fine particle material obtained from a AFG Model Alpine 800 fluidized jet mill. The AFG Model Alpine 800 fluidized jet mill has a scale up factor of around 30 with respect to the AFG Model Alpine 200. The scale-up factor is determined from the power delivered by the gas phase exiting the nozzles at the two scales based on thermodynamics of adiabatic expansion of a gas. Other relevant differences between the two jet mills include the number of jet streams and the number of classifier wheels. The AFG Model Alpine 800 fluidized jet mill can have, for example, 4 or 5 jet streams depending on the application, while the AFG Model Alpine 200 has only 3. The AFG Model Alpine 800 fluidized jet mill typically can have three resident classifier wheels. The AFG Model Alpine 200 has only 1 resident classifier wheel. Finally, the height and width of the AFG Model Alpine 800 fluidized jet mill are around three times the height and width of the AFG Model Alpine 200 fluidized jet mill. The results here, when compared to those obtained with an unmodified classifier wheel, indicate that the high spin vortex rings of the present invention permit the obtention of a narrower size particle distribution of small sized or fine toner particles compared to the particle size distributions obtained without the use of the high spin vortex rings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> wherein d<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>is the cut point, &eegr; is the dynamic viscosity, Q is the volumetric air flow rate, &rgr; is the density of particle material, n is the wheel speed in revolutions per unit time, H is the wheel height at a radial distance R, and the index i denotes the inner edge of the wheel vane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, by varying or modifying, for example, reducing the diameter of the classifier or grinder wheel fines outlet opening or aperture with a removable high spin vortex ring permits greater control over the coarse end or coarse fraction of the particulate size distribution of the particulate material. The variation or modification of the wheel outlet opening or aperture can be accomplished, for example, by mounting or affixing the high spin vortex ring article to the outlet opening or exit port of an existing fluid bed jet mill classifier wheel, for example, an AFG Model available from Alpine. The vortex ring article can be readily interchanged with other vortex rings of different outlet opening diameters, if desired, to better regulate or control the separation of upper or coarse fraction particles in the particle size distribution and therefore better control the quantity and quality of the fine particle fraction. This control of the particle size separation and distribution can, in embodiments, eliminate the need for any coarse particle removal or separation at the classification stage in the manufacture of narrow size distribution toners and thereby affords a substantial time and cost savings in the manufacture of fine toner and related particulate materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The high spin vortex ring concept of the present invention can also provide a smaller cut-size at the grinder or classifier compared to similar wheel speeds which advantage can afford increased wheel speed latitude for smaller sized particle separations. The ability to increase wheel speeds, by for example, using maximum grinding air, is important in achieving high or maximum particle throughput rates, especially, for example, in the manufacture of ultrafine toner particles, such as from about 1 to about 5 microns in diameter with very narrow size distributions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The particle size and quality of the particle separation that can be accomplished in the present invention can be measured and quantified using, for example, the Coulter sizing technique, such as, the aforementioned D<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>/D<highlight><subscript>75 </subscript></highlight>metric or the D<highlight><subscript>84</subscript></highlight>/D<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>metric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It will be readily evident to one of ordinary skill in the art that the relative orientation in space of the upper and lower surfaces of the assembled classifier wheel is not critical and can function satisfactorily when oriented in any direction. In operation the particle feed can be provided to the apparatus in various known ways, for example, as a fluid containing suspended particles, or a fluidized particle stream. A preferred fluid is a gas, for example, dry air at or near atmospheric temperature and pressure. The solid particulate can be any material which is readily separable by the classifier wheel and is preferably friable, a non- or only weakly agglomerating, for example, a toner formulation comprising particles of a mixture of a pigment and a resin. The classifier wheel of the present invention can be satisfactorily operated at rotational velocities which are used in conventional classification separators, for example, from about 500 to about 25,000 revolutions per minute, and preferably from about 500 to about 5,000 revolutions per minute, with the result that the separation of fine particles from coarse particles is improved substantially over wheel geometries of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Descriptions of exemplary separations obtained with the present invention follow. Particles smaller than about 12 microns are separated from a population of particles ranging in size average diameters of from about 0.1 to about 1,000 microns, as practiced in, for example, a fluid bed grinder, where the larger particles are continuously ground until sufficiently small to be removed through the classifier wheel. Particles smaller than about 4 microns are separated from a population of particles ranging in size average diameter of from about 1 to about 12 microns, as practiced, for example, in a classifier, where undersized particles are removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus and particle separation processes thereof with a separation sharpness index exceeding a value of about 0.7, for example, from about 0.7 to about 1.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The cut point of the apparatus and of a classification process corresponds to the nominal particle size at which two opposing and competing forces have substantially equal magnitudes. The magnitude of the two forces acting on an individual particle in a classifier, for example, air drag and centrifugal force, can be calculated using common fluid dynamics equations. These forces, and more importantly, their relative magnitudes, change with position within a classifier wheel. A plot of the cut point (dT) versus radial position (R) can be drawn. Such a graphical analysis has been accomplished by R. Nied and Sickel and reported in an article &ldquo;Modern Air Classifiers&rdquo;, in <highlight><italic>Powder Handling and Processing</italic></highlight>, Vol. 4, No. 2, June 1992, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Toner compositions can be prepared by a number of known methods, such as admixing and heating resin particles obtained with the processes of the present invention such as water soluble styrene butadiene copolymer derivatives, pigment particles such as magnetite, carbon black, or mixtures thereof, and cyan, yellow, magenta, green, brown, red, or mixtures thereof, and preferably from 0 to about 5 percent of charge enhancing additives in a toner extrusion device, such as the ZSK53 available from Werner Pfleiderer, and removing the formed toner composition from the device. Subsequent to cooling, the toner composition is subjected to grinding utilizing, for example, a Sturtevant micronizer for the purpose of achieving toner particles with a volume median diameter of less than about 25 microns, and preferably of from about 4 to about 12 microns, which diameters are determined by a Coulter Counter. Subsequently, the toner compositions can be classified utilizing, for example, a Donaldson Model B classifier for the purpose of removing toner fines, that is toner particles less than about 4 microns volume median diameter. Alternatively, the toner compositions are ground with a fluid bed grinder equipped with a classifier wheel constructed in accordance with the present invention, and then classified using a classifier equipped with a classifier wheel constructed in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Illustrative examples of resins suitable for toner and developer compositions of the present invention include branched styrene acrylates, styrene methacrylates, styrene butadienes, vinyl resins, including branched homopolymers and copolymers of two or more vinyl monomers; vinyl monomers include styrene, p-chlorostyrene, butadiene, isoprene, and myrcene; vinyl esters like esters of monocarboxylic acids including methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, n-octyl acrylate, phenyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, and butyl methacrylate; acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide; and the like. Preferred toner resins include styrene butadiene copolymers, mixtures thereof, and the like. Other preferred toner resins include styrene/n-butyl acrylate copolymers, PLIOLITES&reg;; suspension polymerized styrene butadienes, reference U.S. Pat. No. 4,558,108, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In toner compositions, the resin particles are present in a sufficient but effective amount, for example from about 70 to about 90 weight percent. Thus, when 1 percent by weight of the charge enhancing additive is present, and 10 percent by weight of pigment or colorant, such as carbon black, is contained therein, about 89 percent by weight of resin is selected.
