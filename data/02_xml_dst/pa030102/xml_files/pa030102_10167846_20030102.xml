<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to apparatus for trapping flies and other flying insects for collection and subsequent disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The prior art is replete with flying insect traps of various configurations. Many of these prior flying insect traps are adapted for industrial, commercial, farming and like environments where a large number of flying insects may be encountered and collection of a large-volume of flying insects is desired. Flying insect traps of this type generally use relatively large bags or other volume storage containers for collection of the captured flying insects, and as a result are generally not suitable for personal or home use. Other prior flying insect trap arrangements are relatively complicated and corresponding expensive, and thus also not generally suitable for home or personal uses. Flying insect traps generally of the above types are shown in Mayo, U.S. Pat. No. 2,931,127; Brophy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,058,257; Weimert et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,141,173; and Bible, U.S. Pat. No. 5,329,725; Roche, U.S. Pat. No. 3,123,933; and Rueff, U.S. Pat. No. 3,987,578. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Certain prior flying insect traps that appear to be smaller or simpler or otherwise generally more suitable for home and personal use are shown in O&apos;Connell, U.S. Pat. No. 3,336,694; Schneider, U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,100; Williams, U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,789; Boobar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,788,789; Taylor; U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,226; Patti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,014,460; Chang, U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,865; Jobin et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,301,456; Meyer, U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,987; Regan et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,211; Chu et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,992,087; Plato et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,112,454; and Nelson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,690. Each of these arrangements purports to solve certain aspects and problems associated with apparatus trapping, collection and disposal of flying insects prior thereto, however, each also exhibiting certain drawbacks associated therewith. Such drawbacks and disadvantages include having exposed lights and/or insect catching water or fly paper such that persons and especially smaller children are at risk of injury, and the equipment at risk of being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, Phillips, U.S. Pat. No. 4,117,624 discloses an insect trap that includes an exposed light and fly paper for catching flying insects. In this instance, the light is at risk of being damaged from external sources, and the sticky paper is exposed to the outside contaminating elements, reducing the useful life of the paper </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Carter, U.S. Pat. No. 5,243,781; Herbert, U.S. Pat. Des. No. 350,802; and Green et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,822 each disclose flying insect traps that utilize a cone-shaped entry-way into a storage area. However, in each of these instances, with the storage area above the apex of the cone (i.e., outside the cone), disposal of the collected insects requires either removal of the storage unit from the cone (Herbert), or turning over the entire unit (Green and Carter), in order to dump the collected insects. Such dumping is an awkward procedure for disposing of collected insects, particularly where these apparatus includes bait to draw the flying insects upwardly through the cone. Moreover, the use of bait is generally undesirable for several reasons, including the smell often times associated therewith, and the inconvenience of having an additional component to deal with in the use of such flying insect traps. It is believed that none of these prior arrangements have achieved substantial commercial success for home or personal use due to these and other drawbacks and difficulties in the collection and disposal of flying insects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a new and improved flying insect trap that is suitable for home or personal use. In particular, there is a need for a flying insect trap that is relatively simple in operation and construction, does not require bate, does not present exposed lights and/or insect catching apparatus, and is adapted for ease of collection and disposal of collected flying insects. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The general aim of the present invention is to provide a new and improved flying insect trap that is portable, relatively compact, relatively simple in construction, and is adapted for safety and ease of use and disposal of collected insects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A detailed objective of the invention is to provide a flying insect trap that includes a generally upwardly converging translucent or transparent entry-way for the insects entering the trap, but that eliminates the need to turn over the entry-way or the entire unit in order to dispose of the collected insects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another detailed objective of the invention is to provide an insect attracting light protectably housed in the translucent entry-way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another detailed objective is to provide for the use of a generally upwardly facing sticky surface that is enclosed below the entry-way for collection of insects, the insect-collection surface being generally enclosed and shielded from external contaminating elements yet easily removed and replaceable without substantially disturbing the unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A more detailed objective is to achieve the foregoing by providing a disposable tray adapted to be slipped into and out of position in the unit, the tray being provided with either pre-installed fly paper with a sticky film or a pre-applied layer or film of sticky adhesive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another objective is to provide a fan adapted to draw flying insects into the entry-way and to direct the flying insects onto the insect-collection surface of the fly paper or the sticky film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet another detailed objective of the invention is to position the disposable tray in the forced air flow path of the fan such that the insects are caught on the fly paper when the air impinges thereon prior to the air turning and exiting laterally from the trap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Still another objective is to provide a guard positioned above the translucent entry-way to permit entry of flying insects, but sized to inhibit objects from falling into and through the entry-way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The invention also resides in the provision of an insect-collection surface with raised mounds for enhanced insect-collection capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These and other objectives and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Briefly, a preferred flying insect trap in accordance with the invention includes a cover having translucent side portions that converge upwardly to an upper opening, an insect attracting light positioned inside the transparent side portions of the cover, a lower base section having laterally facing exhaust ports, an axial flow fan to draw the flying insects through the inlet and downwardly toward the lower base section, and a tray provided with a generally upwardly facing, insect-collection sticky surface slidably positioned in the lower base section such that the air impinges on the sticky surface, causing the flying insects to be caught thereon, prior to the air turning and exiting laterally through the exhaust ports. </paragraph>

It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For purposes of illustration, one embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as flying insect trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The flying insect trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a base assembly comprising a lower base section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having generally enclosing sides provided with laterally facing exhaust openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Slidably positioned in the lower base section is a tray <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a bottom <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> oriented cross-wise with respect to and near or below the lower portions of the exhaust ports <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Secured to the tray bottom is a sheet of fly paper <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with its &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; fly-catching side facing upwardly. In preferred embodiments, the tray and fly paper are supplied together as a disposable unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown, a pair of support strips or tracks <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) extending along the inside of opposing sides <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are sized and shaped to slidably receive and support the tray <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that the tray and fly paper are easily slid into and removed from the trap (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). This provides for ease in discarding a tray with used fly paper, and replacing it with a tray having fresh paper. The tray <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown includes a sidewall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>sized and shaped to cooperate with the sidewalls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> such that, when the tray is installed into the trap, the sidewalls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>cooperate to define the generally enclosing sidewalls of the lower base section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Extending upwardly from the base assembly is a cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a generally open lower end, an upper opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and translucent side portions that converge upon progressing toward the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The sides of the cover define generally enclosing sidewalls that cooperate with the base section to define a substantially closed air-flow path between the upper opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the lower exhaust ports <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Positioned above the tray <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an electric motor driven axial-flow fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with fan blades <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> oriented to draw air downwardly therethrough such that the fan generally creates a spiral vortex of air as it is drawn downwardly through the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and through the cover. Electrical wiring, generally designated herein as reference numeral <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, connects the fan to an external electric power supply (not shown), such as through electrical connection area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and an electric power cord <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Positioned above the fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and generally within the translucent side portions of the cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for illumination therethrough is an electric light bulb <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a type suitable to attract flying insects, and an associated light bulb socket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Electrical wiring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> connects the light bulb socket to the external electric power supply such as through electrical connection area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the electric power cord <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In preferred embodiments, the light bulb <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is an ultraviolet or a black light for attracting flying insects from a relatively large area surrounding the trap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Positioned above the cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via support legs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is a cap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The cap is sufficiently raised to permit the entry of flying insects through opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and is sized to generally overlap the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to inhibit objects from falling into the trap. The legs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are, for example, permanently connected to the inside of the upper portion of the cover, or they may releasably connected thereto with suitable releasable connection configuration therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, the lighted bulb <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attracts flying insects to the vicinity of the trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, whereupon the tapered side portions of the translucent cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> result in the insects migrating toward the upper end of the cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Upon reaching the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the insects are drawn into the downwardly flowing air vortex and into the interior of the cover, then down through the fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and forced onto the fly paper <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as the air-flow impinges thereon prior to exiting laterally through the exhaust ports <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The air-flow path through the trap generally indicated by the flow direction arrows identified with &ldquo;F&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the fly paper is no longer effective in catching the flying insects, i.e., when the fly paper is &ldquo;full&rdquo;, or at other convenient times, the tray <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is simply removed from the lower base section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and discarded, and a tray with fresh fly paper is installed into the trap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that alternate flying insect trap configurations and arrangements will fall within the scope of the present invention. For illustrative purposes, one alternate embodiment flying insect trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown in the drawings in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, with the same reference numerals being used for the same items in the two embodiments, and with similar items being in accordance with the description of trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> above except as shown in the drawings and/or as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The light bulb socket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured directly to the fan housing, such as with adhesive, fasteners received into the housing of the fan or to a permanent bracket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that is part of or connected to the fan housing. Alternately, for example, the light bulb socket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is secured such as with a rivet or tubular eyelet or a threaded hollow stud <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and threaded nut <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the center of support bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that is raised above the fan housing. In this instance, (i) the trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a mid-section enclosure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that extends above the height of the fan housing, that has generally open upper and lower ends, and that includes enclosing side portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, (ii) the support bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extends between the sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the mid-section enclosure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and (iii) the cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is releasably connected such as at the lower end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> thereof to mid section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to permit changing the light bulb <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a four-sided, pyramid shaped, upwardly converging translucent sides. Alternately, the trap may be provided with a cover having other upwardly converging side configurations such as with a generally frusto-conical shaped translucent cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> having a round upper opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as shown in the trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. And although the covers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are shown made entirely from translucent material, they may be alternately made with portions of non-translucent materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The tray <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the flying insect trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is slidably positioned between vertically spaced tracks <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extending along opposing sides <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and is provided with a lip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to grab during installation and removal of the tray. In this instance, the exhaust ports <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the tray entrance side of the lower base section are located in the fixed sidewall thereof above the tray. And although the traps are shown provided with corrugated fly paper with mounds in the form of ridges raised from the base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the tray, to provide increased insect-holding capacity, it will be understood that flat fly paper or otherwise may be alternately provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also provided with a cap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> positioned above the upper opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to inhibit objects from falling into the trap. In this instance, the cap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is shown generally round (when viewed from above) to present a shape complimentary to the shape of the cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the upper end of the cover <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with integrally molded or otherwise connected legs <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Although the caps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are shown generally dome-shaped, suitable caps pursuant hereto may take any shape suitable for the purposes hereof including substantially flat and integrally molded caps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As further illustration, portions of a second alternate, preferred embodiment flying insect trap <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is shown in the drawings in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The construction and operation of trap <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to traps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> described above. Thus, the trap <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> includes a lower base section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> provided with generally enclosing sides <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and laterally facing exhaust ports <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, a disposable tray <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having a base <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> cross-wise with respect to the exhaust ports and an outer sidewall portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a pair of tracks <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> adapted to slidably receive and support the sides <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tray, a mid-section enclosure <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, a cover <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> provided with translucent side portions that converge upon progressing upwardly toward an upper opening <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the sides of the cover, mid-section and base cooperating to define a substantially closed air-flow path between the upper opening <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the lower exhaust ports <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and a cap <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> connected at the top of the cover <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> above the upper opening <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with legs <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this instance, support surfaces <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are provided on support legs that extend upwardly from the lower base section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> at approximately the height of the lower base section to support an electric motor driven axial-flow fan for operation as described above in connection with traps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an electric light bulb is suitably supported above the fan and within the mid-section for positioning of the bulb viewable through the translucent side portions of the cover, and electrical wiring is provided to power the fan and light bulb. A bracket <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is another alternate arrangement suitable for riveting to the fan housing such as at the ends <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thereof and for supporting a light bulb socket in the center <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>therein raised above the fan. The cover <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is secured to the mid-section <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> with hooks <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that are configured to bend resiliently inwardly as they slid over the tops of slot arrangements <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and then snap outwardly into the slots, while being guided into position with guide posts <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Whereas the trays <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the traps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are provided with sticky fly paper that is preferably corrugated for increased insect-holding capacity, tray <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is provided with spaced mounds <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that rise upwardly from the base <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and the upwardly exposed surface of the base <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the raised mounds <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are provided with a film or layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; material to capture insects thereon. The sticky layer is pre-applied to the tray to provide for a disposable tray, such as being sprayed or brushed onto the base and raised mounds of the tray. The tray <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is further provided with slotted walls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> surrounding the adhesive covered mounds and exposed base portion; these walls act as an added baffle to assist in preventing insects from exiting the trap as the tray becomes filled with captured insects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be apparent that the present invention brings to the art a new and improved flying insect trap that is uniquely adapted to be compact and portable, and which, by virtue of the cover provided with upwardly converging side portions, an axial flow fan operative to draw flying insects into the cover through the top thereof, and a film of sticky coating on the tray transverse to the air-flow path prior to the air exiting laterally through exhaust ports, results in the flying insects impinging onto and being caught on the disposable tray. The flying insect trap is adapted for ease of disposal of collected insects by virtue of the slid-in tray arrangement, and the protected light and sticky film substantially reduce the likelihood of adverse effects from external sources as compared with prior traps having exposed sticky films and lights. As a result, the flying insect trap of the present invention provides a highly effective trap that is adapted for convenience and safety yet is simple in construction and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
