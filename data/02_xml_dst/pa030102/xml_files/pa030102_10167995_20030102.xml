</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns a flexible bag intended to receive a biological fluid, a bag system comprising such a bag, and a method using such a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such a bag is intended in particular to receive blood or a component of blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The integration of such a bag in a closed system with a view to separating the blood into its components is known, in particular from the document U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,541. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To this end, the system typically comprises means of taking blood, a primary bag intended to collect the blood and, connected to this by means of tubes, at least one filter and at least one secondary bag intended to receive the filtrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of such a system involves successively a centrifugation step for separating the blood into its various components, namely plasma, white corpuscles or leukocytes, and red corpuscles, and a step of filtration of at least one component of the blood, in order to eliminate the leukocytes. It is in fact known that leukocytes are undesirable in blood components to be transfused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During the centrifugation step, it is necessary to introduce into the centrifugation bowl not only the various flexible bags but also the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, it proves that, during this step, the filter may be damaged, because of the acceleration and the centrifugation speed: it may in fact bend, thus creating preferential passages for the blood, or may break, which consequently makes the filtration inoperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, and in particular when the filter has a rigid enclosure, the centrifugation thereof conjointly with the flexible bags and the tubes may, through friction, cause damage to these. In some cases, this damage may cause piercing of a bag and/or a tube, which makes the system unusable for the separation of the blood into its components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To remedy these problems, various systems have already been proposed. These can be classified into two categories: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> systems requiring a particular arrangement of the centrifugation bowl, for example by inserting in the bowl a rigid support intended to accept the filter during the centrifugation step and therefore to separate the filter from the other components of the system; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> systems having recourse to means external to the centrifugation bowls, namely, for example, means of associating the filter on the bowl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The systems in the first category have in particular the drawback of requiring a particular type of support for each centrifugation bowl. In particular, the presence of the rigid support inside the bowl limits the space available for the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is known that it is possible to provide, for the systems in the second category, either association means integrated in the filter or external to it. In the first case, the production of the filter is made more complicated. In the second case, adhesive strips are in particular used which provide unreliable association. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is known from the document U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,934 that a case can be associated on a bag in order to house a filter during the centrifugation. This solution has in particular the drawback of not being simple to implement in that it requires the production of a specific case which must be associated with the bag during a specific step. In addition, the association is effected on one face of the bag which, during filling of the bag, deforms. Thus a loss of reliability of the association may be caused, notably during the high forces which are caused by the centrifugation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to mitigate these drawbacks, the invention proposes in particular means of temporarily associating the filter on one of the bags in the system, which allow reliable and easy association thereof without substantially increasing the difficulty in production and the cost of the said bag. Thus, during the centrifugation step, the bag and the filter temporarily form a compact assembly which ensures the protection of the various components of the system, in particular avoiding friction between them, as well as the movement of the filter during the centrifugation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, this assembly is easy to handle, since it can be placed in the centrifugation bowl, then removed once the centrifugation has ended, in a simple and rapid fashion, and without risking mixing the centrifuged components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, the system can be used with the types of bowl commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect, the invention concerns a flexible bag intended to receive a biological fluid with a view to its centrifugation, comprising an external enclosure formed by two sheets of flexible plastic connected at their periphery so as to define an internal volume for the said fluid, the said external enclosure being provided with at least one inlet and/or outlet orifice for the fluid, the said bag also comprising means for the temporary association of at least one component with the said bag, the said means being disposed on the external enclosure, in which the temporary association means are assembled on the bag on a part of the periphery of the enclosure and are arranged to allow the insertion of the said component between the said means and the said enclosure so as to provide temporary association during the centrifugation of the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the temporary association means are formed from a strip of flexible plastics material, the said strip being assembled on the bag over a part of the periphery of the enclosure so as to form a passage between the said strip and the said enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, the temporary association means are formed by a portion of a sheet of flexible plastics material, the said portion being associated with the bag over part of the periphery of the enclosure so as to form a housing between the said portion and the said enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect, the invention concerns a bag system comprising a bag as described above, in which a filter is connected to the said bag by means of a tube so as to be able to be associated temporarily with the said bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect, the subject matter of the invention is a method of separating blood into its various components using a bag system, the said method comprising the steps making provision for: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> associating the filter with the bag according to the invention; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> taking off the whole blood in a bag; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> centrifuging the bag system so as to separate the blood into its various components; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> separating the filter from the bag so as to allow subsequent filtration of at least one component of the blood.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> depict a flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> intended to receive a biological fluid. In one particular example, this fluid is blood or one of the components of blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments depicted, the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular in shape. It comprises an external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by two flexible weldable and sterilisable plastic sheets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;, for example made from PVC. These two sheets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected at their periphery <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for example by welding, so as to define an internal volume <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises, on its external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an inlet orifice <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an outlet orifice <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the fluid. These orifices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are connected to flexible tubes, typically made from plastics material, intended to allow the circulation of the fluid in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, not shown, the fluid inlet and outlet can take place through one and the same orifice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also comprises temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, enabling at least one other component to be associated with it. These temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are disposed on the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus it is possible to temporarily insert a component between the temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(first embodiment), the temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed by a strip of flexible plastics material <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This strip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is assembled, for example by welding, by means of its lateral ends <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, on two opposite edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; of the periphery <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided between the strip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so as to allow the temporary manual insertion of the component. The width of the strip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is designed so that it is possible to insert the component and to hold it, once inserted, against the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is thus possible to make the component pass between the strip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so as to associate it temporarily with the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the component associated with the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, substantially rectangular in shape, is connected to the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and to another bag (not shown) by a tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. The two tubes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; are placed on two opposite edges <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; of the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so as to facilitate the insertion of the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the strip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> This type of flexible filter is for example described in the document FR-2 677 883 issuing from the applicant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed by two strips of flexible plastics material <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&Prime;. These two strips can be identical to that of the first embodiment and are disposed parallel to each other, in order to provide a better holding of the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the tubes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; can be placed between the two strips <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&Prime; in order to improve this holding still further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of a flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprising temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed by a portion of a sheet of flexible plastics material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The sheet portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular in shape. Its surface is approximately half the size of the surface of the sheets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; which form the enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The sheet portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected by means of three of its sides <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&Prime; to three adjacent edges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the periphery <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Thus the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be inserted temporarily in a housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> formed between the sheet portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the external enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, by means of an opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is housed partially in the housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the tubes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; thus remaining outside the housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the strip of plastics material <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the strips <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&Prime; and the sheet portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, once inserted, is situated substantially at the centre of the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This central position facilitates the handling of the system, and, during the centrifugation step, allows better distribution of the weights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In particular, this positioning avoids the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> coming into contact with the bottom of the bowl, which is a source of damage to the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be connected to the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by welding. To this end, it is advantageous for the sheets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and respectively the strip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the strips <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&Prime; and the sheet portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be produced from the same plastics material so as to be able, in a single welding step, to produce the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention. In addition, the connection of the temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to a part of the periphery <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> allows a particularly reliable association because of the strength and stability of the said periphery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A description is now given, in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, of a first and second embodiment of a bag system for the sterile closed-circuit filtration of a biological fluid, this system comprising a flexible bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The bag system comprises a primary bag <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> intended to contain the blood to be filtered, the said primary bag <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being connected by means of a first tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and at one of its outlet orifices <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, to the inlet orifice <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a variant, the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be associated with the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> subsequently to the collection of the whole blood in the primary bag <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), the bag system is typically intended for the sterile closed-circuit filtration of the plasma and an erythrocyte concentrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This system comprises, in its part I, a bag system like the one described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, intended for the sterile closed-circuit filtration of an erythrocyte concentrate, and also comprises a part II which is connected to the part I by a tube <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connected to the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by means of a junction <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The part II is formed by an assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprising a satellite bag <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; and a satellite bag <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> being intended for the filtration of the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The bag <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, intended to collect the plasma, is connected on the one hand, at an inlet orifice <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, to the bag <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of a tube <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and on the other hand at an outlet orifice <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to an inlet orifice <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; by means of a tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The bag <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is intended to receive the filtrate, that is to say the plasma with leukocytes removed. To this end, it is connected by means of a tube <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and at an inlet orifice <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to an outlet orifice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> This system makes it possible, after having been sterilised, to perform the following steps in closed circuit: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> respectively associating the filters <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; with the bags <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, by means of the temporary association means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> collecting the whole blood in the primary bag <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> centrifuging the system so as to separate the blood into its components; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> collecting the high platelet content plasma in the satellite bag <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> filtering the erythrocyte concentrate and collecting the filtrate in the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> centrifuging the system so as to separate the high platelet content plasma into a layer of platelets and a layer of plasma; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> disconnecting the filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; from the bag <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> filtering the plasma and collecting the filtrate in the bag <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the tubes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are separable and weldable so as to be able, after filtration, to separate the system from the bags containing a blood component and thus allow their possible subsequent transfusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In particular, prior to the second centrifugation, the part II and the bag <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are disconnected from the system by cutting and welding the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In embodiments which are not shown, the bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be associated by means of a tube with another bag to allow subsequent treatment of the filtrate collected in the said bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
