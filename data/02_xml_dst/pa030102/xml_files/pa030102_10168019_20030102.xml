<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to new modulators of dopamine neurotransmission, and more specifically to new substituted 4-(phenyl N-alkyl)-piperazines and 4-(phenyl N-alkyl)-piperidines, and use thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain. Since this discovery, made in the 1950s, the function of dopamine in the brain has been intensely explored. To date, it is well established that dopamine is essential in several aspects of brain function including motor, cognitive, sensory, emotional and autonomous (e.g. regulation of appetite, body temperature, sleep) functions. Thus, modulation of dopaminergic function may be beneficial in the treatment of a wide range of disorders affecting brain functions. In fact, both neurologic and psychiatric disorders are treated with medications based on interactions with dopamine systems and dopamine receptors in the brain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Drugs that act, directly or indirectly, at central dopamine receptors are commonly used in the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, e.g. Parkinson&apos;s disease and schizophrenia. Currently available dopaminergic pharmaceuticals have severe side effects, such as extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia in dopaminergic antagonists used as antipsychotic agents, and dyskinesias and psychoses in dopaminergic agonists used as anti-Parkinson&apos;s agents. Therapeutic effects are unsatisfactory in many respects. To improve efficacy and reduce side effects of dopaminergic pharmaceuticals, novel dopamine receptor ligands with selectivity at specific dopamine receptor subtypes or regional selectivity are sought for. In this context, also partial dopamine receptor agonists, i.e. dopamine receptor ligands with some but not full intrinsic activity at dopamine receptors, are being developed to achieve an optimal degree of stimulation at dopamine receptors, avoiding excessive dopamine receptor blockade or excessive stimulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Compounds belonging to the class of substituted 4-phenyl-N-alkyl)piperazine and substituted 4-(phenyl-N-alkyl)piperidines have been previously reported. Among these compounds, some are inactive in the CNS, some display serotonergic or mixed serotonergic/dopaminergic pharmacological profiles, while some are full or partial dopamine receptor antagonists or agonists with high affinity for dopamine receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A number of 4-phenylpiperazines and 4-phenyl-piperidine derivatives are known and described, for example Costall et al. European J. Pharm. 31, 94, (1975), and Mewshaw et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, 295, (1998). The reported compounds are substituted 4-phenyl-piperazines, most of them being 2-, 3- or 4-OH phenyl substituted and displaying DA autoreceptor agonist properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Fuller R. W. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therapeut. 218, 636, (1981) disclose substituted piperazines (e.g. 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine) which reportedly act as serotonin agonists and inhibit serotonin uptake. Fuller R. W. et al Res., Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 17, 551, (1977) disclose the comparative effects on the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 29, 201, (1980) disclose the comparative effects on the 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid concentration in rat brain by 1-(p-chlorophenol)-piperazine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Boissier J. et al., Chem Abstr. 61:10691c, disclose disubstituted piperazines. The compounds are reportedly adrenolytics, antihypertensives, potentiators of barbiturates, and depressants of the central nervous system. In addition, Akasaka et al (EP 0675118) disclose bifenylderivatives of piperazines, which exhibits dopamine D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor antagonism and/or 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor antagonism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A number of different substituted piperazines have been published as ligands at 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1A </subscript></highlight>receptors, for example Glennon R. A. et al. J. Med. Chem., 31, 1968, (1988) and van Steen B. J., J. Med. Chem., 36, 2751, (1993), Dukat M. -L., J. Med. Chem., 39, 4017, (1996). Glennon R. A. discloses, in international patent applications WO 93/00313 and WO 91/09594, various amines, among them substituted piperazines, as sigma receptor ligands. Clinical studies investigating the properties of sigma receptor ligands in schizophrenic patients have not generated evidence of antipsychotic activity, or activity in any other CNS disorder. Two of the most extensively studied selective sigma receptor antagonists, BW234U (rimcazole) and BMY14802, have both failed in clinical studies in schizophrenic patients (Borison et al, 1991, Psychopharmacol Bull 27(2): 103-106; Gewirtz et al, 1994, Neuropsychopharmacology 10:37-40). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Among the compounds belonging to the class of substituted 4-(phenyl-N-alkyl)piperazine and substituted 4-phenyl-N-alkyl)piperidines previously reported some are inactive in the CNS, some display serotonergic or mixed serotonergic/dopaminergic pharmacological profiles while some are full or partial dopamine receptor antagonists with high affinity for dopamine receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide new pharmaceutically active compounds, especially useful in treatment of disorders in the central nervous system, which do not have the disadvantages of the above described substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the work leading to the present invention, it was found that it is desired to provide substances with specific pharmacological properties, namely modulating effects on dopamine neurotransmission. These properties have not been described earlier, and they are not possible to obtain with the earlier known compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The compounds of the present invention have unexpectedly been found to act preferentially on dopaminergic systems in the brain. They have effects on biochemical indices in the brain with the characteristic features of dopamine antagonists, e.g. producing increases in concentrations of dopamine metabolites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Yet, dopamine receptor antagonists characteristically suppress behavioral activity across a variety of experimental settings including spontaneous locomotion, amphetamine induced hyperactivity. They are also known to induce catalepsy in rodents. In contrast, the compounds of this invention-show no or limited inhibitory effects on locomotor activity. Although some of the compounds can reduce locomotion, they do not induce the profound behavioral inhibition, characteristic of dopamine D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor antagonists. The compounds of this invention either lack inhibitory effects on locomotor activity, or exert milder inhibitory effects on locomotor activity than what would be expected from dopaminergic antagonists. Further, they can even be mild stimulants on behavior. Despite their behavioral stimulant properties some of the compounds can reduce d-amphetamine induced hyperactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the compounds of this invention surprisingly show a dopaminergic action profile with clear antagonist like effects on brain neurochemistry but no, or mild, antagonist like effects, on normal behavior, they can activate animals with a low baseline activity, but can also inhibit behavior in states of hyperactivity. The action profile suggests modulatory effects on dopaminergic functions, clearly different from known compounds belonging to these chemical classes or effects anticipated of typical dopamine receptor antagonists or agonists from these or other chemical classes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Given the involvement of dopamine in a large variety of CNS functions and the clinical shortcomings of presently available pharmaceuticals acting on dopamine systems, the novel class of dopaminergic modulators presented in this invention may prove superior to presently known dopaminergic compounds in the treatment of several disorders related to dysfunctions of the CNS, in terms of efficacy as well as side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Some compounds of this invention have been found to have surprisingly good pharmacokinetic properties including high oral bioavailability. They are thus suitable for the preparation of orally administered pharmaceuticals. There is no guidance in the prior art how to obtain compounds with this effect on dopamine systems in the brain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present-invention-,relates to-new di-substituted 4-(phenyl-N-alkyl)-piperazines and di-substituted 4-(phenyl-N-alkyl)-piperidines in the form of-free base or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing said therapeutically active compound and to the use of said active compound in therapy. An objective of the invention is to provide a compound for therapeutic use, and more precisely a compound for modulation-of dopaminergic systems in the mammalian brain including man. It is also an objective of the invention to provide a compound with therapeutic effects after oral administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> More precisely, the present invention is directed toward substituted 4-(phenyl N-alkyl)-piperazine or 4-phenyl-N-alkyl)-piperidine compounds of Formula 1:

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Pharmacology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Evidence is available that neurotransmission in the CNS is disturbed in psychiatric and neurologic diseases. In many instances,,for example in schizophrenia or Parkinson&apos;s disease, pharmacotherapies based on antagonism or agonism at dopamine receptors are useful, but not optimal, In recent years much efforts have been put on finding novel and selective ligands for dopamine receptor subtypes (D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>) with the aim to improve efficacy and reduce side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention offers another principle for novel therapeutics based on interactions with dopamine systems. The compounds of this invention have effects on brain neurochemistry similar to antagonists at dopamine D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptors. In contrast to currently used dopamine receptor antagonists the compounds of this invention show no, or limited inhibitory effects on locomotion. They can even be mildly activating. Surprisingly, the compounds of the invention can actually also reduce the increase in activity induced by direct or indirect dopaminergic agonists, i.e. d-amphetamine and congeners. Furthermore, some of the compounds display a high oral bioavalability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Below, some examples of preferred compounds according to the invention are discussed more in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One preferred compound is 4-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-propyl-piperidine, further illustrated in Example 9. In rat, 4-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-propyl-piperidine increases 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid in the striatum from 1089&plusmn;102 (controls) to 1680&plusmn;136 ng/g tissue, p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, at 50 &mgr;mol/kg s.c. Surprisingly, it has no significant inhibition on spontaneous behavior; 1287&plusmn;272 cm/30 min (for controls) vs. 944&plusmn;114 cm/30 min at 50 &mgr;mol/kg s.c. Nor did it affect the locomotor activity of habituated rats, from 1381&plusmn;877 cm/60 min (for the controls) to 1300&plusmn;761 cm/60 min at 50 &mgr;mol/kg s.c. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> d-Amphetamine induced hyperactivity was significantly reduced from 8376&plusmn;2188 cm/30 min, to 3399&plusmn;1247 cm/30 min, at 50 &mgr;mol/kg s.c., p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, Fischer PLSD. Surprisingly, 4-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-propyl-piperidine-has an oral availability (F) of 55% in; rat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Similar to 4-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-propyl-piperidine, 4-(4-fluoro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1-propyl-piperidine, which the compound according to Example 43, increases 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid in the striatum from 974&plusmn;39 (for controls) to 1895&plusmn;100 ng/g tissue, p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, at 100 &mgr;mol/kg s.c. According to the behavioral assay in nonpretreated rats it mildly increseas locmotoractivity from 14&plusmn;4 cm/30 min (for the controls) to 540&plusmn;128 cm/30 min, 30-60 min, p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, at 100 &mgr;mol/kg s.c. Thus, 4-(4-fluoro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1-propyl-piperidine displays the properties desired according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The importance of the substitution in the para position is demonstrated by 1-propyl-4-(3-triflouromethyl-phenyl) piperazine, which is not a compound according to the present invention, which carries the same substituent as 4-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-propyl-piperidene (the compound of Example 9) in the meta position but lacks substitution in the para position. With this change the neurochemical effects are retained but the effects on behavior are significantly altered. Thus, 1-propyl-4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine increases 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid in the striatum from 1066&plusmn;46 (controls) ng/g tissue to 3358&plusmn;162 ng/g tissue at 50 &mgr;mol/kg s.c., p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, followed by behavioral inhibition from 1244&plusmn;341 cm/60 min (controls) to 271&plusmn;137 at 50 &mgr;mol/kg s.c., p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4. These properties are not desired according to the present invention, and accordingly 1-propyl-4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine is not a substance according to the present invention. 1-propyl-4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine has an oral availability (F) of 9,5% in rat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 1-(4-Chloro-3-nitro-phenyl)-4-propyl-piperazine, which is the compound of Example 19, increases 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid in the striatum from 1074&plusmn;42 (for controls) to 1693&plusmn;104 ng/g tissue,-p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, at 100 &mgr;mol/kg s.c. According to the behavioral assay it mildly increases locomotoractivity from 56&plusmn;25 cm/30 min (for the controls)to 266&plusmn;89 cm/30 min, 30-60 min. p&equals;0.06, n&equals;4, at, 100 &mgr;mol/kg s.c., 1-(4-Chloro-3-nitro-phenyl)-4-propyl-piperazine reduces d-amphetamine induced hyperactivity from 29792&plusmn;3212 cm/60 min (d-amphetamine controls) to 3767&plusmn;2332 cm/60min. p&lt;0.05, n&equals;4, at 100 &mgr;mol/kg s.c.

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> This step maybe accomplished by one of several standard methods known in the art. For example, a thiocarbonyl derivative (for example a xanthate) may be prepared and removed by a free radical process, of which are known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group may be removed by reduction with a hydride source such as triethylsilane under acidic conditions, using such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid or boron trifluoride. The reduction reaction can be performed neat or in a solvent, such as methylene chloride. A further alternative would be to first convert the hydroxyl group to a suitable leaving group, such as tosylate or chloride, using standard methods. The leaving group is then removed with a nucleophilic hydride, such as, for example, lithium aluminium hydride. This last reaction is performed typically in an inert solvent, such as, ether or tetrahydrofuran. Another alternative method for removing the hydroxyl group is to first dehydrate the alcohol to an olefin with a reagent such as Burgess salt (J. Org. Chem., vol 38, 1973, 26) followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the double bond under standard conditions with a catalyst such as palladium on carbon. The alcohol may also be dehydrated to the olefin by treatment with acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The protecting group, A, is removed under standard conditions known by those skilled in the art. For example, t-Boc cleavages are conveniently carried out with trifluoroacetic acid either neat or in combination with methylene chloride. F-moc is conveniently cleaved off with simple bases such as, ammonia, piperidine, or morpholine, usually in polar solvents such as DMF and acetonitrile. When A is Cbz or benzyl, these are conveniently cleaved off under catalytic hydrogenation conditions. The benzyl group can also be cleaved off under N-dealkylation conditions such as treatment with &agr;-chloroethyl chloroformate (J. Org. Chem., vol 49, 1984, 2081-2082). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is further possible to convert a radical R1 in a compound of the Formula 1 into another radical R1, e.g. by oxidizing methylsulfide to methylsulfone (for example by m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), substitution of a triflate or halide group with a cyano group (for example palladium catalyzed cyanation), substitution of triflate or halide group with a ketone (for example palladium catalyzed Heck reaction with butyl vinyl ether), substitution of a triflate or halide group with a carboxamide (for example, palladium catalyzed carbonylation), or cleaving an ether by, for example, converting a methoxy group into the corresponding hydroxyl derivate, which can further be converted into the corresponding mesylate or triflate. The terms mesylate and triflate refers to OSO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or OSO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> For behavioral testing, the animals were placed in separate motility meter boxes 50&times;50&times;50 cm equipped with an array of 16&times;16 photocells (Digiscan activity monitor, RXYZM (16) TAO, Omnitech Electronics, USA), connected to an Omnitech Digiscan analyzer and a Apple Macintosh computer equipped with a digital interface board (NB DIO-24, National Instruments, USA). Behavioral data from each motility meter box, representing the position (center of gravity) of the animal at each time, were recorded at a sampling frequency of 25 Hz and collected using a custom written LABView&trade; application. The data from each recording session were analyzed with respect to distance traveled and small-scale movements, e.g. stops in the center of the behavior recording arena, during the recording session. To determine small-scale movements velocity at each time point is calculated as the distance traveled since the preceding sample divided by the time elapsed since the preceding sample. The number of stops is then calculated as the number of times that the velocity changes from a non-zero value to zero. The number of stops in the center of the behavioral recording arena is calculated as the number of stops occurring at a position at least ten centimeters from the edges of the recording arena. For behavioral testing-of habituated rats, the animals were placed in the motility meter boxes 30 minutes before the administration of test compound. Each behavioral recording session lasted 60 or 30 minutes, starting immediately after the injection of test compound. Similar behavioral recording procedures was applied for non-habituated rats, habituated rats and drug pretreated rats. Rats pretreated with d-amphetamine are given the dose 1,5 mg/kg s.c. 5 min before the behavioral session in the motility meter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> After the behavioral activity sessions the rats were decapitated and their brains rapidly taken out and put on an ice-cold petri-dish. The limbic forebrain, the striatum, the frontal cortex and the remaining hemispheral parts of each rat were dissected and frozen. Each brain part was subsequently analyzed with respect to its content of monoamines and their metabolites. The monoaminergic indices analyzed were dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), and noradrenaline (NA). All monoaminergic indices in the dissected tissue were analyzed by means of HPLC with electrochemical detection as described by Svensson K, et al., 1986, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg&apos;s Arch Pharmacol 334:234-245 and references cited therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> To determine oral availability (F); and plasma half life (t&frac12;) of test compounds of this invention experiments performed in the rat were undertaken. On day one rats were implanted with one catheter in the jugular vein and one catheter in the carotid artery under ketamine anesthesia. On day three test compound is injected the either orally or in the jugular vein catheter. Blood samples are collected during 8 hours from the arterial catheter. The blood samples were heparinized and centrifuged. Plasma is collected from the centrifuged samples and frozen. The levels of test compound were subsequently determined in each sample by means of gas chromatographymass spectrometry (Hewlett-Packard 5972MSD). The plasma samples, taken from the rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain, (0.5 ml) were diluted with water (0.5 ml), and 30 pmol (50 &mgr;l) of ((&minus;)&mdash;S-3-(3-Ethylsulfonylphenyl)&mdash;N-n-propyl-piperidine as internal standard was added. The pH was adjusted to 11.0 by the addition of 25 &mgr;l saturated Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. After mixing, the samples were extracted with 4 ml dichloromethane by shaking for 20 min. The organic layer was, after centrifugation, transferred to a smaller tube and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and subsequently redissolved in 40 &mgr;l toluene for GC-MS analysis. A standard curve over the range of 1-500 pmol was prepared by adding appropriate amounts of test compound to blank plasma samples. GC was performed on a HP-Ultra 2 capillary column (12 m&times;0.2 mm ID), and 2 &mgr;l was injected in the splitless mode. The GC temperature was held at 90&deg; C. for 1 minute following injection, and was then increased by 30&deg; C./min to the final temperature of 290&deg; C. Each sample was run in duplicate. The lowest detectable concentration of test compound was generally found to be 1 pmol/ml. </paragraph>
