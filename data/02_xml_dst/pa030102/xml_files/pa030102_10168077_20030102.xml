<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a catalyst for producing a polyurethane, and a process for producing a polyurethane in which the catalyst is used, such as a flexible, rigid or semi-rigid polyurethane foam or a polyurethane elastomer. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for producing a polyurethane such as a polyurethane foam which can be used as heat insulating materials for construction materials, electric refrigerators, refrigerated warehouses, baths and the like, interior materials for automobiles, furnishings, cushioning materials for beddings, various sealing materials and the like, and a catalyst for producing a polyurethane used therefor. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As a catalyst used in the production of a polyurethane, N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetramethylethylenediamine and N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetramethylpropylenediamine have been widely used because of their appropriate catalytic activity and excellent moldability. However, there are serious defects in public health when the catalysts are used since the catalysts not only exhibit bad stimulative smells but also generate eye rainbow (the state where a rainbow is observed) due to the vapor of the catalyst during the operation for the production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to eliminate these defects, there has been proposed a tertiary amine catalyst such as 1,4-diazabicyclo&lsqb;2.2.2&rsqb;octane or N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetramethylhexamethylenediamine. The effects due to the catalysts can be recognized to some extent. However, it could not yet have been said that the effects are sufficient. Also, since these tertiary amine catalysts would not be incorporated into the polyurethane via a chemical bond during the urethanation, there are some defects in the catalysts such that there occur inconvenient results such as a so-called &ldquo;vinyl-staining&rdquo; which is caused by the discoloration of a vinyl chloride resin sheet used as a substrate, and a so-called &ldquo;fogging&rdquo; meaning the fogging of window glass of an automobile due to the catalyst vapor diffused from the polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As an amine catalyst which is incorporated into the polyurethane during the urethanation, there has been proposed a tertiary amine catalyst having in its molecule a hydroxyl group and an amino group reactive with isocyanate group. When the tertiary amine catalyst is used, the problems in vinyl-staining and fogging are solved. However, the molecular structure of the polyurethane would be changed by the amine catalyst, so that there are some defects in heat resistance such that the strength is lowered especially when the polyurethane is exposed to an atmosphere having a high temperature for a long period of time, and that the polyurethane is colored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a rigid polyurethane foam has been used as heat insulating materials for construction materials, electric refrigerators, refrigerated warehouses, baths and pipes because of its excellent heat insulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the polyurethane foam is used, for instance, as heat insulating materials for house or building construction materials, the polyurethane foam has been produced by mixing a component comprising a polyol as a main component with a component comprising a polyisocyanate as a main component, spraying the resulting mixture to a desired site such as wall surface or ceiling in the construction site of a house or building with a spray machine or the like to foam, and curing the foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the polyurethane foam is formed in a manner as described above, peculiar strong odor based on the used tertiary amine catalyst worsens the working environment. Moreover, since the unreacted tertiary amine catalyst remains in the polyurethane foam even after molding, there are some problems in public health such as odor caused by the release and dispersion of the tertiary amine catalyst from the polyurethane foam. Recently, as a catalyst for producing a polyurethane which causes little problem in public health, there has been proposed a tertiary amine catalyst having a hydroxyl group in its molecule for the purpose of the avoidance of vinyl-staining and fogging (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Sho 62-115017 and Sho 61-252219). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When the tertiary amine catalyst having a hydroxyl group in its molecule is used in the production of the polyurethane foam, the problem regarding odor is eliminated. However, since the reactivity of the polyol component with the isocyanate component used in the production of the polyurethane foam is low at low temperatures, a long period of time is required for the production. Especially, when the polyurethane foam is formed by means of spraying, problems such as dripping would be caused. Also, there are some defects such that heat of the polyurethane foam generated during the production is robbed off by the air, and that the reaction is less likely to proceed, so that the compressive strength is lowered and its dimensional stability is lowered at low temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst for producing a polyurethane exhibiting little odor, and a process for producing a polyurethane foam excellent in vinyl-staining resistance, fogging resistance and heat resistance, using the catalyst for producing a polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a process capable of rapidly producing a polyurethane foam excellent in dimensional stability even under low-temperature surroundings with the generation of little odor based on the catalyst for producing a polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The catalyst for producing a polyurethane, comprising a DAAA represented by the formula (I) generates little odor, and has excellent characteristics of imparting vinyl-staining resistance, fogging resistance and heat resistance to the polyurethane obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the term &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; includes two concepts: the one is a case where only the DAAA is used, and the other is a case where the other catalyst for producing a polyurethane is contained together with the DAAA within a range which would not hinder the object of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the formula (I), each of R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. It is preferable that each of R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is methyl group from the viewpoint of catalytic activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> X is a branched alkylene group having 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Among them, those having no branched chain at alpha and beta positions of the nitrogen atom are preferable from the viewpoint of catalytic activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As preferred concrete examples of the DAAA, there can be cited 5-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1-pentanol, 4-dimethylamino-2-methyl-1-butanol, 4-dimethylamino-2,2-dimethyl-1-butanol, 5-dimethylamino-3,3-dimethyl-1-pentanol, 6-dimethylamino-2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and the like. These can be used alone or in admixture of at least two kinds. Among them, 5-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1-pentanol is especially preferable, from its high yield in preparation, and its inexpensive preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The DAAA can be readily prepared by reacting a corresponding branched alkanediol with a dialkylamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Especially, 5-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1-pentanol can be prepared by reacting 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol as a starting material with dimethylamine. However, a large amount of bis(1,5-dimethylamino)-3-methylpentane in which dimethylamino groups are bonded to the two hydroxyl groups of 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol is formed as a by-product of 5-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1-pentanol, thereby lowering its yield. However, when 5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-pentanal which is industrially readily available is used as a starting material, 5-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1-pentanol can be prepared in a high yield since 5-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1-pentanol in which dimethylamino group is bonded only to the aldehyde, can be selectively prepared by reacting the aldehyde with dimethylamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The amount of the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising DAAA cannot be absolutely determined because the amount of the catalyst varies depending upon the kind of the polyurethane. It is desired that the amount of the catalyst for producing a polyurethane is usually at least 0.3 parts by weight, preferably at least 0.5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol component which is a starting material of the polyurethane, from the viewpoint of increasing the reactivity of the polyol component with the isocyanate component. Also, it is desired that the amount of the catalyst for producing a polyurethane is at most usually 10 parts by weight, preferably at most 8 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol component, from the viewpoint of maintaining the strength of the polyurethane. Therefore, in view of the above circumstances, the desired amount of the catalyst for producing a polyurethane is 0.3 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 8 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The kind of the polyurethane to which the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA is applicable is not limited to specified ones. As the polyurethane, there can be cited flexible, rigid and semi-rigid polyurethane foams, polyurethane elastomers, and the like, but the present invention is not limited only to those exemplified ones. Among them, the flexible, rigid and semi-rigid polyurethane foams are preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition, when a polyurethane foam is produced for another purpose of the present invention, it is preferable to use a catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA and the FTA compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA and the FTA compound is used, little odor based on the catalyst would be generated during the production of a polyurethane foam. Moreover, there can be exhibited an excellent effect such that a polyurethane foam being excellent in dimensional stability can be rapidly produced even in the low-temperature surroundings as in winter season. The reason why the above excellent effect is exhibited would be presumably based on the facts that the DAAA suppresses the odor of the FTA compound by using the DAAA together with the FTA compound, and that the reactivity is improved at low temperatures and the cross-linking density is increased by the synergistic effects of the combined use of these compounds, so that the dimensional stability is improved at low temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA and the FTA compound is used, these excellent effects are exhibited. Therefore, even in low-temperature surroundings as in winter season, a rigid polyurethane foam can be produced by directly spraying a mixture containing the catalyst to a desired site such as wall surface or ceiling in a construction site such as house, building or the like with a spraying machine or the like to foam, and curing the foam, and the formed rigid polyurethane foam can be suitably used as a heat insulating material for construction materials and the like. Moreover, since the resulting polyurethane foam generates little odor based on the catalyst for producing a polyurethane, when the catalyst is used for the production of a semi-rigid polyurethane foam, the obtained semi-rigid polyurethane foam can be suitably used, for instance, for interior materials for automobiles such as headrests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As representative examples of the FTA compound, there can be cited a compound represented by the formula (II): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>N&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&mdash;A&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(II) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> wherein each of R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or may be bonded to each other to form a 3- to 6-membered nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic group; A is oxygen atom or a single bond, and when A is oxygen atom, each of m and n is independently an integer of 2 to 6, and when A is a single bond, each of m and n is an integer satisfying m&plus;n&equals;2 to 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As concrete examples of the FTA compound represented by the formula (II), there can be cited dialkylaminoalkylamines such as 3-dimethylaminopropylamine, 3-diethylaminopropylamine, 3-dipropylaminopropylamine, 4-dimethylaminobutylamine, 6-dimethylaminohexylamine, 3-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)propylamine, 2-dibutylaminoethylamine and 8-dimethylaminooctylamine; heterocyclic aminoalkylamines such as 2-(1-aziridinyl)ethylamine, 3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propylamine, N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine, N-methyl-N&prime;-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine, 1,4-bis(2-aminoethyl)piperazine, N-(3-aminopropyl)piperazine, N-methyl-N&prime;-(3-aminopropyl)piperazine, 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine, 2-(1-morpholino)ethylamine and 3-(1-morpholino)propylamine; and the like. These can be used alone or in admixture of at least two kinds. Among them, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of 3-dimethylaminopropylamine, 4-dimethylaminobutylamine, 6-dimethylaminohexylamine and 3-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)propylamine, especially 3-dimethylaminopropylamine can be suitably used, from the viewpoint that very little odor is generated when used together with the DAAA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The DAAA/FTA compound &lsqb;weight ratio&rsqb; is preferably 5/95 to 95/5, more preferably 10/90 to 80/20, from the viewpoint of preventing the odor and the viewpoint of improving the reactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is desired that the total amount of the DAAA and the FTA compound is at least 0.5 parts by weight, preferably at least 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol component, from the viewpoint of increasing the reactivity of the polyol component with the isocyanate component and the viewpoint of improving the dimensional stability at low temperatures. Also, it is desired that the total amount of the DAAA and the FTA compound is at most 10 parts by weight, preferably at most 8 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol component, from the viewpoint of maintaining the strength of the polyurethane foam. Therefore, in view of the above circumstances, it is desired that the total amount is 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 8 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyol component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The other catalyst for producing a polyurethane may be used within a range which would not hinder the object of the present invention. It is preferable that the other catalyst for producing a polyurethane foam is one having a boiling point of at least 130&deg; C. from the viewpoint of suppressing its evaporation or volatilization since its internal temperature becomes 100&deg; to 130&deg; C. or so during the production of polyurethane foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As the other catalysts for producing a polyurethane, there can be cited, for instance, tertiary amine catalysts such as 1,4-diazabicyclo&lsqb;2.2.2&rsqb;octane, 2-methyl-1,4-diazabicyclo&lsqb;2.2.2&rsqb;octane, N-ethylmorpholine, N-(dimethylaminoethyl)morpholine, N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetramethylpropylenediamine, N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetramethylhexamethylenediamine, N,N&prime;,N&prime;-trimethylaminoethylpiperazine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, N,N,N&prime;,N&Prime;,N&Prime;-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether, 1,8-diazabicyclo&lsqb;5.4.0&rsqb;undecene-7, N,N&prime;,N&Prime;-tris(3-dimethylaminopropyl)hexahydro-s-triadine, 6-dimethylamino-1-hexanol, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, N,N-dimethylaminoethoxyethanol and N,N-dimethylaminoethoxyethoxyethanol, derivatives thereof, salts thereof with an acid such as a carboxylic acid or carbonic acid; organometallic compounds represented by organotin compounds; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of imparting anti-flaming property to a polyurethane foam, the catalyst can be used together with a catalyst for producing a polyisocyanurate represented by a potassium salt such as potassium acetate or potassium octylate, or a quaternary ammonium salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The amount of the other catalyst for producing a polyurethane and the amount of the catalyst for producing a polyisocyanurate are not limited to specified ones, and may be appropriately adjusted within a range which would not hinder the object of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The polyurethane can be produced by reacting the polyol component with the isocyanate component in the presence of the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA. Among the polyurethanes, when a polyurethane foam is produced, a polyurethane foam can be produced by reacting a polyol component with an isocyanate component in the presence of the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA, a blowing agent, and, as occasion demands, a surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The polyol component is not limited to specified ones, and may be any of those conventionally used ones during the production of a polyurethane. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A polyurethane foam can be formed by, for instance, mixing a polyol component with a blowing agent, the catalyst for producing a polyurethane, a surfactant and other auxiliaries to give a polyol mixture, mixing the resulting polyol mixture with an isocyanate component with stirring with a blowing machine or the like, injecting the mixture into a mold, and allowing the mixture to foam. More specifically, for example, the temperature of the above-mentioned polyol mixture is adjusted to 20&deg; C. or so using a tank, and thereafter the polyol mixture is reacted with the isocyanate component using a foaming machine such as an automatically mixing and injecting foaming machine or an automatically blending and injecting foaming machine, whereby a polyurethane foam can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As explained above, since the catalyst used for producing a polyurethane of the present invention exhibits little odor, there are exhibited some excellent effects such that the catalyst is highly excellent in working surroundings during the production of the polyurethane, and that odor based on the catalyst for producing a polyurethane is not generated from the polyurethane produced. In addition, when the catalyst for producing a polyurethane of the present invention is used, there can be produced a polyurethane excellent in vinyl-staining resistance, fogging resistance and heat resistance. Therefore, the polyurethane produced by the process of the present invention can be suitably applied directly to the construction site as a heat insulating material for wall surface or ceiling of a house, building or the like. When the catalyst is used for producing a semi-rigid polyurethane foam, the obtained polyurethane can be suitably used for automobile interior materials such as headrests and armrests. In addition, when the catalyst is used for producing a flexible polyurethane foam, since there is generated little odor due to the catalyst, the obtained polyurethane can be suitably used for furnishings, cushioning materials such as beddings, and interior seat cushioning materials for automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA and the FTA compound is used, there can be rapidly produced a polyurethane foam with the generation of little odor based on the catalyst for producing a polyurethane, and being excellent in dimensional stability at low temperatures even in low-temperature surroundings as in winter season. Therefore, the process of the present invention using the catalyst for producing a polyurethane comprising the DAAA and the FTA compound can be especially suitably applied directly to the construction site as a heat insulating material for wall surface or ceiling of a house, building or the like when a heat insulating material made of a polyurethane foam is formed. Further, since little odor based on the catalyst for producing a polyurethane are generated from the produced polyurethane foam, the polyurethane foam can be suitably used as cushioning materials such as headrests, and the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the results shown in Table 1 that according to Example 1, the working environment during the production of the polyurethane is improved since the catalyst for producing a polyurethane has very weak odor. Also, it can be seen that the polyurethane foam obtained in Example 1 has a relatively high strength-retaining ratio, and fogging is less likely to be generated since its haze value is small at high temperatures (80&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A test for examining the vinyl-staining resistance was not carried out. However, according to Example 1, since the DAAA is used as a catalyst for producing a polyurethane, and the DAAA has dimethylamino group and a primary hydroxyl group in its molecule and is incorporated into the polyurethane foam via chemical bond, the polyurethane foam exhibits the effects similar to the fogging resistance, namely the haze value as to the vinyl-staining resistance. Accordingly, it can be seen from the results of the haze value shown in Table 1 that the polyurethane foam obtained in Example 1 is also excellent in vinyl-staining resistance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the results shown in Table 2 that according to Examples 2 to 8, the reactivity during the production of the polyurethane foam is excellent since CT and GT are short periods of time nevertheless the molding is carried out at low temperatures, and the dimension stability at low temperatures is excellent since there is little change in dimensions. Also, it can be seen that there can be obtained polyurethane foams generating little odor based on the catalyst for producing a polyurethane since a catalyst having dimethylamino group and a primary amino group or hydroxyl group in its molecule is used and the catalyst itself is non-transferable from the polyurethane foam. </paragraph>
