<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns an apparatus for adjusting the inclination of a seat squab of a vehicle seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An apparatus of that kind is known from DE 30 22 950 A. The vehicle seat involves in particular a truck seat, a tractor seat, a stacking truck seat, or a seat for a building machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Usually, such adjusting apparatuses of the kind set forth in the opening part of this specification are integral components of the respective vehicle seat, that is to say in production of the corresponding vehicle seat they are integrated into same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide an adjusting apparatus of the kind set forth in the opening part of this specification, which is also suitable for subsequent fitment, that is to say for subsequent combination with a vehicle seat, and which, while being of a relatively simple structural configuration, requires only a small amount of space in the heightwise direction of the vehicle seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, in an apparatus of the kind set forth in the opening part of this specification, that object is attained in that there is provided a rocker having an upper and a lower rocker element which are pivotably movably connected together by lateral bearing bushes, that fixed to the upper rocker element is a toothed bridge with mutually oppositely disposed bridge tooth arrangements which are concentric with respect to the bearing bushes, and that provided between the two bridge tooth arrangements of the toothed bridge are two toothed sliders with slider tooth arrangements facing away from each other and provided between the two toothed sliders is a locking member rotatable about a rotary axis extending through the bearing bushes, wherein the two toothed sliders are linearly movably guided on the lower rocker element between a locking position of engaging into the bridge tooth arrangements and a release and adjusting position spaced from the bridge tooth arrangements, the locking member is provided for adjustment of the two toothed sliders between the release and adjusting position and the locking position, and provided between the rotary axis and the lower rocker element is a prestressed spring element which urges the two toothed sliders self-lockingly into the locking position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The rocker of the adjusting apparatus according to the invention, with the upper and the lower rocker elements, is advantageously only of a small structural height so that the rocker can be disposed without any problem between the seat squab of a vehicle seat and a seat springing arrangement which is usual in relation to such vehicle seats. By virtue of its small structural height, the apparatus according to the invention has scarcely any influence, or only an unnoticeable influence, on the overall height of the corresponding vehicle seat. By means of the adjusting apparatus according to the invention, the seat squab of a vehicle seat can be adjusted for example through an order of magnitude of &plusmn;12 degrees relative to the horizontal, in small angular steps. This appropriately involves adjustment about a transverse axis of the seat, which is defined by the rotary axis. By means of suitable adaptor components, it is also possible to embody inclination of the seat transversely with respect to the direction of travel, that is to say about a longitudinal axis of the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has proven desirable for the upper and the lower rocker elements to be in the form of sheet metal parts. Those sheet metal parts may involve deep-drawn or stamped parts which are simple and inexpensive to produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Structurally simple and highly reliable fixing of the toothed bridge to the upper rocker element is afforded if the toothed bridge is centered on the upper rocker element by centering projections and fixed by means of fixing elements spaced therefrom. Those fixing elements may involve fixing screws or preferably rivets. By virtue of the centering projections which are spaced from the fixing elements and which project without play into associated holes in the upper rocker element, the respective forces are reliably transmitted from the seat squab of the vehicle seat to the upper rocker element and thus to the rocker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to permit so-called &lsquo;sliding ratcheting&rsquo; when the inclination of the seat squab of the vehicle seat is adjusted as desired, it is desirable if the bridge tooth arrangements of the toothed bridge and the slider tooth arrangements of the toothed sliders have wave-shaped tooth profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It has proven to be advantageous if, in the case of the adjusting apparatus according to the invention, each of the toothed sliders has a back which is towards the locking member and if the locking member is provided with diametrally mutually oppositely disposed noses which bear against the back. The noses of the locking member and the backs of the toothed sliders are preferably designed in such a way that subsequent adjustment of the toothed sliders is made possible by means of the mechanically prestressed spring element disposed between the rotary axis and the lower rocker element, so that, even after a long period of operation of the adjusting apparatus according to the invention, any play which possibly occurs between the bridge tooth arrangements of the toothed bridge and the slider tooth arrangements of the toothed sliders is eliminated or at least reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is desirable if the lower rocker element is provided with guide slots which are aligned with each other in a line and if the two toothed sliders for displacement thereof between the locking position and the release and adjusting position are provided with guide bars which are linearly movably guided in the guide slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Guide slots of that kind can be produced in a simple and highly precise manner in the lower rocker element. The guide bars are desirably integral component parts of the toothed sliders. That affords an exact and robust structure with excellent operational reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous if the backs of the toothed sliders and the noses of the locking member are designed in such a way that, in the locking position of the toothed sliders, the noses lie on a straight operative line which extends through the rotary axis of the rocker and which extends parallel to the guide slots or is provided in coincident relationship therewith. That advantageously ensures that external mechanical forces which are introduced into the toothed bridge through the upper rocker element of the rocker and which by way of the bridge tooth arrangements exert a force component on the slider tooth arrangements of the toothed sliders do not urge the toothed sliders out of the locking position. That above-mentioned positioning of the toothed sliders on the straight operative line provides for reliably restraining the toothed sliders in the locking position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the adjusting apparatus according to the invention, a respective projection can extend away from each of the two toothed sliders and the locking member can be provided with mutually diametrally opposite sliding guides, by means of which the two toothed sliders are adjustable upon release adjustment of the locking member by the projections against the force of the spring element, from the locking position into the release and adjusting position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The projections are desirably integral component parts of the toothed sliders. The sliding guides of the locking member can be in the form of sliding guide slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the adjusting apparatus according to the invention the rotary axis is of a cross-section which differs from a circular shape. This may involve a quadrangular or square cross-section. The locking member of the locking apparatus according to the invention can have a through hole, the internal cross-section of which is adapted to the cross-section of the rotary axis. If however the adjusting apparatus according to the invention is used not just at one side of the respective vehicle seat but at both sides, then the two locking members can be actuated by means of a common rotary axis. Under given conditions, such as possible twisting of the rocker due to high external forces, the situation may involve non-uniform latching engagement of the toothed sliders on one side of the vehicle seat and on the other side. A rigid connection of the locking members can under some circumstances result in &lsquo;latching beyond&rsquo;, beyond the position of inclination of the vehicle seat that the seat occupant actually wants. In order to avoid such &lsquo;latching beyond&rsquo;, the locking member can have a through hole whose internal cross-section is adapted to the cross-section of the rotary axis in such a way that limited angular rotary movement of the rotary axis relative to the locking member is possible. Such a configuration of the last-mentioned kind has the advantage that the locking members which are individually sprung by virtue of the limited angular rotary movement are pivotable with each other in the release direction, but in the event of a locking position not being implemented on one of the two sides of the vehicle seat, they can assume their locking position independently of each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The adjusting apparatus according to the invention which comprises a small number of individual parts is advantageously simple to produce and assemble and it is of excellent operational reliability, while being of a simple and robust design. A further substantial advantage is that its range of angle or inclination adjustment is great, with a small overall structural height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Adjusting apparatuses for a vehicle seat backrest which is adjustable in respect of its inclination are known for example from DE 35 40 726 C2, DE 38 10 612 C2, U.S. Pat. No. 5,918,714, EP 0 720 930 A1 or DE 198 16 248 C1. All those known adjusting apparatuses for the backrest of a vehicle seat, with a round basic structure, require a relatively large amount of space or base area. As such a known adjusting apparatus is disposed between the backrest and the seat squab of a vehicle seat, that need for base area is not particularly relevant and it has no effect whatsoever on the overall height of the vehicle seat.</paragraph>

This means that the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided with a through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> whose internal cross-section is adapted without play to the cross-section of the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

As is clearly apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is also provided with diametrally oppositely disposed sliding guides <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> against which bear projections <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which extend away from toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is disposed centrally between the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Each of the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided with a slider tooth arrangement <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The slider tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are provided with mutually corresponding, wave-shaped tooth profiles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Provided between the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the lower rocker element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a spring element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which for example is in the form of a coil spring. The spring element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> serves to urge the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by means of the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> against the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, that is to say the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into their locking position. In that case the spring element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is mechanically stressed. To release the rocker member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for adjusting of the inclination of the seat squab <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is suitably pivoted, in which case the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are moved towards each other by virtue of the positively locking contact of their projections <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> against the sliding guides <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, that is to say the slider tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are released from the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In that release and adjusting position of the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the seat squab <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thus the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be adjusted in respect of its inclination as desired. After the desired position of inclination is reached the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is desirably connected to an adjusting lever (not shown) is released. In that case, the mechanically stressed spring element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is mechanically prestressed more greatly in the release and adjusting position can be relieved of stress again in order to cause the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to latch again by way of the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the desired position of inclination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The backs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the noses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are designed in mutually adapted fashion in such a way that the noses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, in the locking position of the toothed sliders (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), lie on a straight operative line <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which extends centrally through the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and which extends parallel to the guide slots <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or the guide bars <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> or which is disposed in coincident relationship therewith. That avoids external forces which are applied to the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> by the rocker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and which by way of the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> exert a force component on the slider tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> being able to move the toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> out of the locking position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is mounted with a defined play on the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and can thus compensate for possible tolerances for example at the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and/or at the slider tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, by virtue of the freedom of movement thereof, which is governed by the play involved. In addition, the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> does not experience any rotational limitation in the direction of rotation of the release and adjusting position and, by virtue of the action of the spring element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, that is to say by the action of the corresponding spring moment, it is capable, by way of the outwardly inclined noses <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, of re-adjusting the backs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which are likewise inclined, of the two toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. That provides that, even after a long period of operation, any play which may possibly occur in the tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and/or in the slider tooth arrangements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is eliminated or at least reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Identical features are identified in each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 12</cross-reference> by the same references so that there is no need for all features to be described in detail in relation to all those Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If a toothed bridge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is used both at the right and also at the left leg portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the upper rocker element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the rocker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the adjusting device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the two locking members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be actuated by a common rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In that case, under certain conditions such as for example when the rocker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is subjected to twisting as a result of great external forces uneven engagement of the toothed sliders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can occur on the left-hand side and the right-hand side. As a result, if the locking members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are rigidly connected by way of the common rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, that can result in &lsquo;latching beyond&rsquo;, beyond the position of inclination which is wanted by the seat occupant. In order to avoid such latching beyond that desired position of inclination, at least one of the two locking members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be provided with a through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; whose internal cross-section is adapted to the cross-section of the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in such a way that a limited angular rotary movement of the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> relative to the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is possible. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13, 14</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> show such a configuration of the through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;, which permits limited angular rotary movement of the rotary axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> relative to the locking member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
