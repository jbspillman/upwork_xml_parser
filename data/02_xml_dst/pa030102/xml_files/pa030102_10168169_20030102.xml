</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A heat engine operating with a low boiling working fluid and a positive displacement rotating expander such as a gerotor or scroll obtains improved efficiencies using superheated working fluid to preheat the fluid prior to entering the boiler or use of cool working fluid to cool systems pumps and the expander. The heat engine is combined with a variety of absorption and compression heat transfer devices to use low temperature heat sources such as solar, bio-mass, and waste heat to provide refrigeration, and heating, work output including pumping and heating of subterranean water and electrical generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A heat engine comprises a boiler with an inlet and an outlet connected to receive a liquid working fluid and vaporize the fluid to a vapor on input of heat from a heat source input. A positive displacement rotating expander such as a scroll or gerotor with an inlet and outlet is adapted for receiving and expanding the vapor from the boiler outlet at high pressure to produce a work output and provide the vapor at low pressure at the expander outlet. A condenser with an inlet for receiving vapor from the expander outlet condenses the vapor back to a liquid. A pump with an inlet and outlet receives the liquid working fluid from the condenser at low pressure and provides it to the boiler inlet at high pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The working fluid typically is a refrigerant such as the chlorofluroethanes R113 or R123 or ammonia. The operating pressures and temperatures of such refrigerants are considerably lower than the operating pressures and temperatures of the usual water working fluid used in heat engines. Because of the lower operating temperatures, a wide variety of heat sources can be used with the expander including solar arrays, geothermal input, waste heat, biomass combustion heat, and fossil fuel combustion heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Because of the availability of organic and ammonia superheats, superheated working fluid from the expander outlet can be used to pre-heat the working fluid by passing it through a heat exchanger before it enters the boiler thereby considerably improving the efficiencies of the heat engine. In addition, cool working fluid leaving the condenser can be used to recapture otherwise lost work heat from the pump and expander by passing the cool working fluid through heat exchange passages and jackets in and on the pump and expander. This captured heat likewise preheats the working fluid prior to its entry into the boiler and improves heat engine operational efficiencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Using readily available heat sources such as biomass, solar panels, or even dung, the heat engine becomes a ready source of electricity by coupling the expander work output to an electrical generator and can provide electricity to satisfy many basic needs for food and shelter in underdeveloped countries. The work output can also be used to pump ground water from underground wells and reservoirs thereby providing a ready source of potable water in areas of water sacristy. By passing the cool ground water through a heat exchanger in the condenser in order to cool the condenser, additional heat engine efficiencies are obtained as compared to air cooling of the condenser. The heated water from the condenser heat exchanger can be stored in tanks to provide a source of hot potable water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By coupling the heat engine with an absorption heat transfer device, a wide variety of refrigeration and heating and cooling needs can be satisfied. Many ways of coupling the various components of the heat engine and absorption heat transfer device can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The basic absorption heat transfer device consists of interconnected components including a generator to separate a strong solution into its refrigerant vapor and absorbent components through the application of heat, a condenser for liquefying the refrigerant vapor with the release of heat, an evaporator for evaporating the refrigerant vapor with the application of heat, and an absorber for combining the refrigerant vapor with the absorbent to form a strong solution with the release of heat. After the refrigerant vapor and the absorbent are combined in the absorber to form the strong solution, the strong solution is sent to the generator to repeat the cycle. A pump is used to pressurize the strong solution as it moves to the high pressure generator. Pressure control devices are used to lower the pressure of the high pressure refrigerant as it moves from the condenser to the evaporator and the high pressure absorbent as it moves from the high pressure generator to the low pressure absorber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a basic combination, the heat engine and absorption device are combined by sharing a common heat source such as a solar array. A heat transfer loop with an interconnected heat source heat-exchanger, a generator heat exchanger, a boiler heat exchanger and a pump for circulating a heat transfer fluid among the components can be plumbed with valves to provide heat to both the generator and the boiler in parallel or series flow or to one or the other devices. Heat from the heat source is transferred to the heat-transfer fluid in the heat source exchanger. The hot heat-transfer fluid is then pumped to the generator heat exchanger or the boiler heat exchanger or both in either parallel or series relation depending on the plumbing and valve settings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage of this arrangement is that when the absorption heat transfer device is used for cooling, the heat from the condenser and evaporator is put to no further use and discharged to a heat sink such as a cooling tower. To take advantage of this lost heat, a second heat transfer loop having interconnected components including an absorber heat exchanger, an absorption device condenser heat exchanger, a boiler heat exchanger and a heat transfer fluid pump is incorporated into the system. In this arrangement, the heat source, e.g., solar panel, is used to heat only the generator by means of the heat source heat exchanger and generator heat exchanger heat transfer loop. The second heat transfer loop transfers heat from the absorber and condenser to the boiler heat exchanger to operate the heat engine. To further improve system efficiencies, the boiler and boiler heat exchanger can be removed from the second heat transfer loop. In this embodiment, the heat exchanger in the absorber or condenser or both can be used as the boiler for the heat engine. For a further increase in absorption device efficiency, a portion of the absorber and a portion of the generator of the absorption device can be operated so that heat exchange takes place between these two portions of the absorber and generator which is commonly referred to as a generator-absorber heat-exchange absorption device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The disadvantage to using the absorber and/or condenser as the boiler for the heat engine is that it assumes that heat at these two components is always available. However, when a heat source such as a solar array is used, nights and inclement weather may preclude absorption device operation. In such a situation, a backup boiler may be added to the absorber/condenser heat transfer loop with appropriate valves to direct heat transfer fluid to either the absorber/condenser boiler arrangement or to the backup boiler. In addition to the solar heat source, an alternate heat source such as a gas-fired burner is plumbed into the heat source heat transfer loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As a further refinement to the overall heat engine and absorption heat-transfer device system, a three loop heat exchanger system can be used. In this arrangement, the heat source heat transfer loop is used to heat the boiler and transfer heat to a second heat transfer loop via a first to second loop heat exchanger. The hot heat-transfer fluid in the second loop heats the generator after which it is used to heat the heat transfer fluid (in the same second loop) in a recuperator that transfers heat to the heat transfer fluid as it goes to the first to second loop heat exchanger. Remaining available heat in the second heat transfer loop is transferred to heat-transfer fluid in a third loop via a second to third loop heat exchanger. After the final transfer of heat to the third loop, the cool heat transfer fluid in the second loop picks up heat (cools) the heat engine absorber. It then passes to the recuperator where it receives additional heat from the second loop heat transfer fluid coming from the generator. The second-loop heat-transfer fluid leaves the recuperator and returns to the first to second loop heat exchanger to repeat the process. Finally the third heat transfer loop consists of an absorption device condenser heat exchanger, an absorber heat exchanger, a second to third loop heat exchanger, a heat sink (cooling tower) and a pump to circulate a third heat transfer fluid among the third loop components. The cool third heat-transfer fluid coming from the cooling tower is pumped to the absorption device condenser and absorber where it picks up heat via the condenser and absorber heat exchangers. It then passes to the second to third loop heat exchanger where it acquires additional heat from the second loop heat transfer fluid after which it passes to the cooling tower to discharge the heat to the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As noted above with respect to the use of the absorber absorption device condenser as a boiler for the heat engine, a lost of the primary generator heat source may mean loss of heat engine power for electrical or pumping operations and the loss of heat and cooling by the absorption system. Such loss of generator and/or boiler heat source is the rule rather than the exception when using a heat source such as a solar array. Also as noted above, this situation can be remedied by the use of a backup heat source and, if necessary, a backup heat engine boiler. As will be seen, another alternative to the loss of the primary heat source is the use of a dual heated generator in which two heat sources are provided to heat the absorption system generator. This has the significant advantage that if the first heat source is down, the second heat source continues to heat the generator and advantage can be taken of otherwise lost condenser and absorber heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, the heat engine and absorption heat transfer device have the same basic configuration as described above, i.e., the heat engine has an interconnected boiler, expander, condenser, and pump while the absorption heat transfer device has an interconnected generator, absorber, condenser, and evaporator. The system also has two heat sources; a high-temperature heat-exchange loop having an interconnected a) heat-source heat exchanger, b) a generator first heat exchanger, and c) a high-temperature pump circulating a heat-transfer medium through the high-temperature loop; a generator second heat exchanger; and a low temperature heat-exchange loop comprising an interconnected a) absorption heat-transfer device condenser heat exchanger, b) absorber heat exchanger, c) a boiler heat exchanger, and d) a low-temperature pump for circulating a heat-transfer medium in the high-temperature loop. The first heat source is configured to transfer heat to the heat-source heat exchanger. The second heat source is configured to transfer heat to the generator second heat exchanger. The generator first heat exchanger and the generator second heat exchanger are configured to transfer heat to the generator. The absorption heat transfer device condenser transfers heat to the absorption heat transfer device condenser heat exchanger. The absorber transferring heat to said absorber heat exchanger. And the heat-engine boiler heat exchanger transferring heat to said boiler. Such a system is particularly effective when the first heat source is a solar array and the second heat source is a gas burner. In such a situation, the gas burner can be ignited and heat delivered to the generator when solar power is not available, i.e., the gas burner serves as a backup heat source. In a basic configuration, the generator second heat exchanger is a vertical annular tube. Hot combustion gases from the gas burner are passed through the annular interior space of the tube heat the tube and transferring heat to the strong solution within the generator and contacting the outside of the vertical annular tube. The generator heat sources can transfer heat to the generator individually or both may be used together such as when the primary heat source is only partially available, e.g., a solar array operating at half power because of overcast skies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In another two generator heat source system, the first heat source transfers heat both to the boiler and to the generator. When insufficient heat is available to the generator from the first heat source, the second heat source is used to transfer heat to the generator. Depending on the operational temperatures of the heat engine and the absorption heat transfer device, it may be possible to use relatively cool heat transfer fluid coming from the first generator heat exchanger to cool the heat engine condenser prior to returning to the first heat source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A three fluid space generator is used with the dual heat source configuration. A substantially first vertical surface separates a first fluid space from a second fluid space and a substantially second vertical surface separates the first fluid space from a third fluid space. The first fluid space is typically an annular space formed by an inclosure consisting of a center portion of an inner cylinder, 2) a center portion of an outer cylinder, 3) an upper separation plate, and 4) a lower separation plate. An upper passage provides for the entrance of strong solution and egress of refrigerant vapor while a lower passage provides for egress of a weak (absorbent) liquid. The upper passage may be formed as two separate ports, an inlet for the strong solution and an outlet for the refrigerant vapor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The first fluid space contains the generator and has a downward flowing liquid, i.e., the strong solution, and an upward flowing gas within said downward flowing liquid. That is, as the refrigerant separates from the absorbent with the application of heat, it forms vapor bubbles in the strong solution that bubble upward in the downward flowing solution. A fluid distribution surface with an aperture formed in it provides for the downward passage and distribution of said downward flowing liquid and the upward passage and distribution of said upward flowing gas in the first fluid space. The fluid distribution surface is substantially perpendicular to the first vertical surface that separates the first fluid space from the second fluid space and the second vertical surface that separates the first fluid space from the third fluid space. The fluid distribution surface is typically formed as an annular plate when used with an annular first fluid space. The aperture in the plate is formed by removing a pie-shaped segment from the annular plate and is of sufficient size to pass both said liquid and said vapor through it. Several plates are arranged in spaced-apart relation with each other in the annular first fluid space with the aperture of each successively spaced-apart annular plate being place on the side opposite the aperture of the previous plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The second fluid space contains a first heat-transfer fluid that heats the first fluid space and the third fluid space contains a second heat-transfer fluid that transfers heat to the first fluid space. The vertical surface separating the first fluid space from the second fluid space typically is an open inner cylinder with the center of said cylinder forming the second fluid space. The first fluid space is an annular space formed by an enclosure that is formed from the center portion of the open inner cylinder outer surface, 2) the center portion of an outer cylinder inner surface, 3) an upper separation plate, and 4) a lower separation plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The vertical surface separating said first fluid space from said third fluid space is typically a tube. Preferably several vertical tubes are used. The vertical tubes are joined at the top so as to be open to an annular upper manifold formed from an upper portion of an outer cylinder, an upper portion of an inner cylinder, c) a top, and an upper separation plate. The manifold contains a port or passage for the entrance or exit of a heat exchange fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The tubes are joined at their lower ends into an annular lower manifold that is formed from a) a lower portion of the outer first fluid cylinder, b) a lower portion of the inner second fluid cylinder, c) a lower separation plate, and d) a bottom. As with the upper manifold, the lower manifold has a port or passage for the passage of a second heat-transfer fluid. In operation, the heat-transfer fluid enters the passage in one of the manifolds and flows through the vertical tubes to the to the other manifold at the other end of the tubes and then exits through the passage in the manifold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> To provide for additional generator efficiencies, heat from the hot absorbent solution (weak solution) leaving the bottom of the generator can be transferred back to the absorber to enhance the desorption process. An inlet receives the hot absorbent from the lower first fluid space lower passage (outlet). The absorbent passes through a heat exchanger in the first fluid space which transfers heat to the strong solution to desorb the absorbent, The absorbent then leaves the heat exchanger (and the first fluid space) by means of a heat exchanger outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The generator is typically combined with other components of an absorption heat transfer device as previously described. A heat exchange loop with a first heat source and the third fluid space is used to heat the generator by circulating heat transfer fluid from a first heat source exchanger to the third fluid space (the vertical tubes with upper and lower manifolds) and then circulating the heat transfer fluid back to the heat source exchanger with a pump. A heat engine boiler can also be added to this loop as previously described. In addition and when the heat transfer fluid is at sufficiently low temperature, it can be used to cool the condenser of the heat engine prior to returning to the heat source. The three fluid space generator can also be used as only a portion of the generator with another portion being in heat exchange with a portion of the absorber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In another system configuration, a second heat source, e.g., a solar heat source transfers heat to the third fluid space of the dual heat generator in a simple transfer loop containing the heat source heat exchanger, a pump, and the third fluid space, i.e., the vertical tubes with upper and lower manifolds. A second heat transfer loop transfers heat from the absorption device condenser and absorber to drive the boiler of a heat engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As a final set of embodiments, the heat engine can be used with a compression heat transfer device, typically by close coupling the work output of the heat engine expander with the compressor of a compression heat transfer device. Such a system has the advantage of reducing considerably the number of components found in the overall system since the compression heat transfer device only involves an interconnected compressor, condenser, evaporator and a throttling value. The expander and compressor of the two devices are typical of similar scroll or gerotor configuration, one device allowing for contraction of a working fluid while the other provides for compression of a working fluid. Working fluids for the compression heat transfer device are similar to or identical with those of the heat engine, preferably organic refrigerants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and especially chlorofluoroethanes and ammonia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> System efficiencies are enhanced by using the superheated working fluid coming from the compressor to transfer heat to the heat engine working fluid as it enter the boiler. Similarly the cool heat transfer fluid from the heat engine condenser can be used to cool the compressor with a compressor heat exchanger, i.e., passages and ports through the compressor along with a compressor cooling jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The system shows considerable saving in heating and cooling a living space over that achieved with conventional furnaces and heat pumps. In a typical heating arrangement the heat engine and compressor are dose coupled through a common shaft. The common shaft serves as the expander work output and the compressor work input shaft. Superheat from compressed working fluid leaving the compressor is circulated to the heat engine working fluid to preheat the heat engine working fluid before it enters the boiler. The working fluid of the compression device is then circulated back to the inlet of the compression cycle condenser. A heat source loop to a solar array heat source transfer heat from the solar array to a heat-transfer fluid, e.g., a hydronic fluid. The heat transfer fluid is then sent to the heat engine boiler where it transfers heat to the boiler by means of a boiler heat exchanger. The heat-transfer fluid than is passed to the compression device evaporator where it provides heat to the evaporator after which it returns to the solar array heat source to repeat the cycle. A pump is employed to circulate the heat transfer fluid through the various components of the heat source heat transfer loop. A second heat-transfer loop employs heat transfer heat exchangers in both the heat engine and compression device condensers to receive heat from the condensers and provides them to a heat exchanger in the living space for heating purposes. A second pump circulates the heat transfer fluid among the interconnected heat transfer components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In cooling mode, the heat engine and compression device are dosed coupled with superheat from the compressor used to heat the heat engine working fluid prior to entry into the boiler in the same fashion as was used in heating mode. Heat from the heat source is used only for heating the boiler of the heat engine by means of a heat transfer loop containing a pump. heat source heat exchanger, and boiler heat exchanger. Heat from the heat exchangers in both the condensers is sent to a heat sink such as a cooling tower. Finally the load, i.e., the living space, is cooled by transferring heat to the compression device evaporator by means of a cooling loop having a heat transfer fluid pump, an evaporator heat exchanger, and a load heat exchanger. Heat from the load, i.e., the living space, is transferred to the compression device evaporator </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings and initially <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the transformation of heat into useful work is shown having 1) a boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having an inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and connected to receive a liquid working fluid and vaporizing said liquid to a vapor on input of heat from a heat source input such as boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>; 2) a positive displacement device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as a rotating expander, e.g., a scroll or gerotor, used in expansion mode and having an inlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and adapted for receiving and expanding said vapor from said boiler outlet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at high pressure to produce a work output <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and providing said vapor at low pressure at said outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, 3) a condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an inlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for receiving said vapor from said expander outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and condensing said vapor back to a fluid liquid; and 4) a pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with an inlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for taking the fluid liquid from condenser outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> at low pressure and providing it to boiler inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at high pressure. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, work output such as provided by rotating shaft <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be put to a variety of uses including its use to drive pumps including pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as indicated by dotted line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and for the production of electricity when connected to a suitable electrical generator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. For clarity, the use of expander output to drive generators and/or one or more system pumps is not illustrated for each of the embodiments shown in the various figures. When it is not convenient to drive system pumps directly from expander output <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be used to drive an electrical generator which in turn is used to power electrical system pumps. Typically water has been the working fluid used in most prior art heat engines. Unfortunately water becomes a wet vapor upon expansion from a saturated vapor and excess superheat is generally not available for recovery. By using an organic working fluid such as R113 (1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane) or R123 (2,2-dichloro-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-trifluoroethane), it is possible to recover the superheat from the expander exhaust stream as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, organic working fluid from expander outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is sent to boiler pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> where it is used to preheat the working fluid prior to entry into the boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> after which it is sent to condenser inlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Hot working fluid from expander outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> enters heat exchanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, heats the working fluid in pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and leaves exchanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from which it flows to inlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Cooler working fluid from pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> enters pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and leaves via outlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from which the heated working fluid flows to boiler inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is possible to also increase the efficiencies of the heat engine by recovering waste work heat produced by frictional and other lost work heat of the pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, by using a heat exchanger such as cooling jacket or passages or both as designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to capture the otherwise lost work heat. Cool working fluid from condenser outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is passed to cooling heat exchanger <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via cooling jacket inlet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and after removing waste work heat via cooling jacket heat exchanger <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, leaves the cooling jacket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> after which it passes to pump inlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> similar waste heat recapture can be used with expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Cool working fluid from condenser outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is passed to a cooling passage, jacket or similar heat exchanger <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. After recovering waste work heat from the expander, the working fluid leaves via outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> from which it is passed to pump inlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the use of heat exchangers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, e.g., cooling jackets or fluid passages, in series. Preheating of the working fluid by recapture of waste work heat from expander <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and pump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> along with expanded fluid superheat reduces the entropy generation of the heat engine and increases its thermal efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> To further increase the efficiencies of the heat engine, ground water can be used to cool condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rather than typical air cooling. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be attached to the work output shaft <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and driven to pump ground water from an underground reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Cool water from reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> enters pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and is discharged via outlet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to the condenser heat exchange inlet <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The water removes heat from the condensing working fluid by means of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> after which the water may be passed to a water storage tank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via condenser heat exchange outlet <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. If the water in the underground reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is potable, water storage tank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> becomes a source of heated potable water via outlet <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the use of heat engine working fluid to improve the operating efficiencies of the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by combining the various features illustrated in the previous figures. Here, hot working fluid leaves expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and preheats cooler working fluid in pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> before it enters boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The hot working fluid from outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> enters inlet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of pre-heater heat exchanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> where it exchanges heat to the relatively cool working fluid that has entered pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The preheated working fluid leaves pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from which it enters boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the working fluid in heat exchanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> leaves the pre-heat exchanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from which it passes to inlet <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where it is condensed. The relatively cool condensed fluid leaves condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and flows to cooling jacket inlet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> where frictional and other lost work heat in pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is extracted into the working fluid by cooling jacket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The working fluid leaves cooling jacket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> from which it passes to cooling jacket inlet <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of expander cooling jacket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Here frictional and other lost work heat of the expander is extracted into the working fluid in cooling jacket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> after which it leaves cooling jacket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> after which it passes to pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via inlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> where it is pressurized and leaves via pump outlet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. From outlet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the warm working fluid then passes into pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> where it is further heated via the hot working fluid passing through heat exchanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as noted above after which it passes from pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As noted previously, heat engine efficiencies can be improved further by using a lower temperature heat sink for extraction of heat from condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This is accomplished by using the work output shaft <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to drive pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and pump relatively cool water (in comparison to an air cooled condenser) from an underground reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and using the water to cool the working fluid in condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The heated water can then be stored in water tank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for use as a source of hot water. Of course If the reservoir contains potable water and care is taken to avoid contamination, tank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> becomes a source of hot potable water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that a variety of heat sources may be used for heat input to boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the heating of the working fluid in boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Because of the low operating temperatures of many organic fluids, it is possible to make use of low temperature heat sources such as solar thermal, geothermal, waste heat recovery, biomass combustion and fossil-fuel combustion. As will be shown and described later, another heat source alternative is the use of a heat-actuated absorption heat transfer device having an interconnected generator with a generator heat input source, an absorber, a condenser, an evaporator and an absorption device working fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment in which waste heat from a combustion engine <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is used as a heat source for boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For clarity, the various working fluid features heat transfer features shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in which the working fluid is used to pre-heat the working fluid prior to entry into boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to capture frictional and other lost work heat in the expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and pumps such as pump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a water pump such as pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> have been omitted. However, all, some or none of the various superheat and lost work heat features of the prior figures may be used in conjunction with the combustion heating of boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be either air or liquid cooled using heat exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Engine coolant passes through various passages in engine <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to remove excess heat from the combustion chambers as indicated by heat exchanger <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The hot coolant is circulated by means of pump <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, typically driven by engine <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, to heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to heat the working fluid in boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> after which the coolant is returned to the engine heat exchanger <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In addition, hot exhaust gases from the combustion engine <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are sent via line <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to further heat the working fluid in boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> after which the cool exhaust gases are vented via outlet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, illustrates a heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for an absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> such as a lithium bromide/water or ammonia/water chiller or heat pump that can also be used to heat boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Valves <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and pump <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> allow for either parallel or series connection of the boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As a result, heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be used for selected delivery of heat to: 1) the absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> alone(by closing valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and opening the three-way valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to permit flow to the absorption device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>), 2) both the heat engine boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in either a) parallel flow or b) series flow, or 3) to the boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alone (by opening valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and positioning valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for bypass flow around absorption device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). Series flow to both boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and absorption device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is accomplished by dosing valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, opening valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and positioning three-way valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for flow to absorption device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Parallel flow is accomplished by partially opening valves <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> positioned for flow to absorption device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. It is to be realized that those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of valve and pump combinations can be used to achieve a particular flow scheme for a particular device configuration. Heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be any one or more of a number of devices including solar thermal, geothermal, waste heat recovery, biomass combustion and fossil-fuel combustion heat sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises an interconnected absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, generator (desorber) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that use a refrigerant and an absorbent as a refrigerant pair (solution pair) and a heat source <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to transfer heat between a heat load and a heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> contacts low pressure refrigerant vapor from evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (via line <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>) with a miscible absorbent from generator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (via line <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>). Absorption takes place as a result of the mixing tendency of the miscible materials as well as an affinity between the refrigerant vapor and the absorbent and results in the generation of thermal energy which is released to the heat sink. The mixture formed by the absorption process, which is referred to here as a strong solution, is typically pressurized by means of a solution pump <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and conveyed via line <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> to generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> causes the refrigerant vapor and absorbent to separate as a result of the application of heat via exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. When the absorbent is a nonvolatile material, heating of the strong solution is sufficient to accomplish complete separation of the refrigerant vapor. The remaining absorbent, referred to as a weak solution, is returned to the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and expansion device <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to again begin the absorption process. When the absorbent is a volatile material such as water in an ammonia/water refrigerant pair, it is desirable to remove a good portion of the volatile absorbent (water) from the refrigerant vapor (ammonia) using an analyzer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which gives a relatively pure absorbent and/or rectifier <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which gives a relatively pure vapor. An analyzer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and rectifier <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> configuration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After vapor purification, if necessary, the vapor passes to the condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> condenses the refrigerant vapor to a liquid with the liberation of heat. The hot liquid refrigerant then passes to the evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> revaporizes the hot refrigerant liquid at low pressure and temperature with input of heat from the heat load, i.e., from the refrigerator, room, building, or other medium the system was designed to cool. When operating as a heat pump, the evaporator takes heat from the outdoor environment while heat from the condenser or absorber or both is used to heat the load. From the evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the refrigerant vapor enters the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to again cycle through the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In each of these components, at least two phases are present with mass transfer between the two phases and each typically involves a heat transfer component. The generator (desorber) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> uses heat to separate a strong solution into a vapor and a liquid absorbent (weak solution), the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> combines the weak solution and vapor with release of heat, the condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> transforms refrigerant vapor to liquid with the release of heat and the evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> transforms liquid refrigerant to vapor with the application of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is heated by the heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by means of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> in heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and heat exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A heat transfer fluid circulates from exchanger <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and from exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to exchanger <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Circulation of heat transfer fluid is carried out by means of pump <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Hot heat transfer fluid from heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be circulated only to generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> by dosing valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and opening valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, heat from heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also be used to heat both the boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> by routing the fluid through exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then through exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (series flow accomplished by opening valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and dosing valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) or by routing hot heat transfer fluid simultaneously to both exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (parallel flow accomplished by placing valves <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> both in an open position). As shown by dashed lines <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be used to operate one or more system pumps <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. It is to be realized that if expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used to operate pump <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, operation of generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> by itself (as opposed to combined operation with boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is precluded. However, by having expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generate electricity using a generator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), storing the electrical energy in a battery, and equipping the system with electrical pumps, the system can remain self-sufficient even when all heat from the heat source is required for absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used as a chiller, overall energy savings can be increased significantly by capturing the heat rejected by absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, all of the heat from heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is directed to generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are interconnected with boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to use the waste heat rejected by the condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Starting at boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, cool heat exchange fluid from the boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> flows to heat exchanger <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> in absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> where it captures rejected absorber heat. The heat exchange fluid then flows to condenser <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to capture rejected condenser heat after which it flows through line <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> to pump <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> where the hot heat exchange fluid is pumped to the boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> where it is used to evaporate the working fluid of heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after which the cool heat exchange fluid leaves the boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to repeat the cycle. Valve <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is used to regulate the flow of heat exchange fluid between absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>.

By opening valve <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, some of the working fluid is allowed to bypass condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As has been previously discussed, expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the heat engine can be used to drive one of more of the system pumps, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> as shown by dashed lines <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The additional heat efficiencies can be achieved in the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by incorporating one or more of the features shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the heat engine of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, the absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is often operated as an lithium bromide/water or ammonia/water chiller with heat supplied by a solar collector array heat source <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> To further improve the efficiencies of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and reduce the number of components including energy drawing pump <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the heat exchange loop between the boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and/or condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be eliminated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the absorber and/or condenser heat exchangers, <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, respectively, become the boiler of heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the working fluid of heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becoming the heat transfer fluid for removing heat from absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and/or condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Cool working fluid from condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pumped by pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> directly to the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> via lines <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> where it is vaporized and returned to expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via lines <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. By transferring heat directly from the condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the working fluid, heat transfer losses due to the transfer of heat from the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to a heat transfer fluid and the transfer of heat from the heat transfer fluid to the working fluid of the heat engine are avoided. Energy losses from frictional and other work losses in pumping the heat transfer fluid between the various components are also avoided. Finally the number of components in the overall configuration are reduced and cost saving effected by having the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> serve effectively as the boiler of heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As with various embodiments already discussed, the output of expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be used to operate one of more system pumps <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> as illustrated by dashed lines <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. In addition, efficiencies achieved by using superheated working fluid to preheat the working fluid (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), use of cooled working fluid from condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to capture lost work heat from pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and use of an under ground water reservoir to cool the condenser and provide hot potable water (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) are also advantageously used with the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates schematically a particular absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> configuration, referred to as a generator-absorber heat-exchange machine, coupled with a heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses the absorber and/or condenser sections of heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as its boiler. The absorption device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> achieves greater operational efficiencies through additional heat exchange among its various components. The generator-absorber heat exchange device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> obtains increased cycle efficiencies by overlapping the temperature ranges of a portion of the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) with a portion of the generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to transfer absorber heat from absorber section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by using an intermediate fluid heat transfer loop or direct heat transfer such as by separator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>.

A heat exchange section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has been added to remove heat from the refrigerant liquid prior to evaporation in evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via exchanger <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and then return this heat to the refrigerant vapor after the vaporization process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In operation, hot weak solution (devoid of refrigerant vapor) leaves the heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> heated generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>via outlet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from which it passes to generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>via inlet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to exchange additional heat to generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>using exchanger <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The weak solution leaves exchanger <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In absorber section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the weak solution, containing refrigerant absorbed in absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, continues to absorb refrigerant coming from evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and inlet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in both liquid and vapor form. Absorption heat from the continuing absorption process is removed by strong solution in exchanger <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The absorbent solution, now having absorbed considerable refrigerant along with any unabsorbed refrigerant vapor passes to absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>along with both liquid and any remaining refrigerant vapor to absorber section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>where the absorption process is completed. Heat from the absorption process is removed by exchanging heat to the working fluid in exchanger <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> which now serves as the boiler for heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The absorbent with absorbed refrigerant, i.e., the strong solution, leaves absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via outlet <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as a cool fluid and is pumped to high pressure by means of pump <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The cool strong solution leaves the pump <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and enters rectifier <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> where the cold strong solution in exchanger <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> serves to remove (condense) absorbent vapor in the refrigerant coming from the desorption process in generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. At splitter <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the strong solution from exchanger <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is divided into two portions, one portion being sent to analyzer section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> where pure absorbent is sent to generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and refrigerant to rectifier section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the other portion sent to outlet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>.

The strong solution in exchanger <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> removes liberated heat from the absorption process occurring in absorber section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The strong solution in exchanger <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> enters generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via inlet <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the strong solution receives sufficient additional heat from the absorption process occurring in absorber section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>via direct heat exchange across separator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to begin the desorption process, that is, the separation of refrigerant from absorbent. The two phase fluid containing refrigerant vapor and relatively strong solution leaves generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via outlet <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> from which it flows to generator section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through inlet <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>.

After the refrigerant is expelled, the hot absorbent liquid, free of refrigerant (hot weak solution), leaves through outlet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to again repeat the absorption desorption process carried out in the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Purified vapor from rectifier <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> passes to condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>.

In effect, the condenser heat exchanger <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> serves as a boiler for the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cooled condenser fluid then passes to the evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> by means of line <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Prior to evaporation, the evaporator liquid exchanges heat to the cold refrigerant vapor via exchanger <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> after which it passes through expansion device <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and into evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> where it receives heat (cools) the load <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by means of interconnected exchangers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and pump <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As noted, heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses the absorber heat exchanger <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and the condenser heat exchanger <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> for the boiler function. That is, the working fluid of the heat engine, typically an organic, low boiling fluid, is evaporated in exchangers <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> rather than using a separate boiler for heating. Thus working fluid flows from pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to tee <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> where it is divided and sent to absorber exchanger <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and condenser exchanger <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As noted previously, a pre-heat exchanger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also be used in this configuration for removing super heat from the working fluid leaving the expander prior to entering &ldquo;boiler&rdquo; exchangers <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 6</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>).

As also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be used to pump water from an underground water reservoir to cool working fluid in condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (via heat exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) rather than using air cooling. The heated water leaving the exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may then be stored in water tank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to provide a source of hot potable water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The above system is particularly advantageous to third world countries with basic water and food needs.

(177-232&deg; C.)and an efficient expander such as a scroll or gerotor (see U.S. application Ser. No. 09/163,491 filed Nov. 17, 1998 all of which in herein incorporated by reference as if completely written herein) using a low-boiling organic working fluid, the system is capable of providing fresh potable hot water and refrigeration (load <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) for meats and dairy products. A coefficient of performance (COP) of near 1.0 can be achieved using an ammonia water absorption system. A backup heat source <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be powered by wood, cow dung, biomass, gas, oil or any other alternative energy source when solar energy is not available.

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The heat transfer device can be used either as a chiller by using the evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to cool a desired space. Or the heat transfer device can be used as a heat pump for both heating and cooling purposes. For heating, the heat expelled by the condenser and absorber is used to heat the desired space (heat sink <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>) with the evaporator drawing heat from the outdoor environment. For cooling, the heat sink becomes the outdoor environment with heat being expelled from the absorber and condenser to the outdoors while the evaporator is used to cool the living space. Alternatively and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the low-temperature loop <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> can be used with water from an underground reservoir as the heat sink. This has the further advantages of providing a lower heat sink temperature for greater operational efficiencies as well as providing a source of hot potable water. Using the heat engine and absorption heat transfer system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> with a solar panel heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the absorption heat transfer device as a chiller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a liquid cooling tower <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> to transfer heat to the outdoors, the following temperatures are achieved: 1) 400&deg; F.

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Preferably the tubes <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> are spiral twisted fluted tubes, that is, thin-wall tubes with ridges and valleys (flutes) spiraling around the exterior wall of the tube with corresponding ridges and valleys spiraling around the interior wall of the tube, that is, a ridge on the exterior to the tube is a valley or flute on the interior of the tube. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,730,229, D&apos;Onofrio, all of which is incorporated herein as if completely written herein. The flow within tubes <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> (third fluid space <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>) maybe upward in counter flow with respect to the down flowing fluid in the first fluid space <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> or in co-flow, i.e. downward in the same direction as the downward flowing fluid in the first fluid space <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Thus passages <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> may serve as either inlets or outlets depending on the direction of fluid flow through the third fluid space. The extensive surface area of the twisted fluted tubes on both the interior and exterior surfaces facilitate good heat and mass transfer. The spiral flutes and ridges promote a long residence time with good mixing action for heat flow through the tubes and the separation of solution components on the exterior of the tubes.

It is to be realized that inlet <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> could be combined into a single upper passage through which the strong solution enters first fluid space <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the refrigerant vapor leaves. After passing through first fluid space <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> all refrigerant is desorbed from the strong solution leaving a weak solution, i.e., essentially pure absorbent. The weak solution is typically at its highest temperature and leaves through lower passage (outlet) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. To take advantage of the sensible heat found in the absorbent, it is passed to heat exchanger <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through inlet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) to provide additional heat to the strong solution in first fluid space <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> after which it leaves exchanger <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through outlet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The generator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> is especially effective when used as part of an absorption heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which in turn is combined with a heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as further illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A basic absorption heat-transfer device has been described previously and has interconnected absorption device components comprising 1) a generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, 2) an absorber, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, 3) a condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and an evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. A pump <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is used to pressurize the strong solution coming from the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> prior to entry into the generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A pressure lowering device <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is used to lower the pressure of the absorbent as it is returned to the absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A similar pressure device <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is used to reduce the pressure of the condensed refrigerant as it goes from condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to the evaporator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the most basic configuration in which the generator device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>) can be used is with a first heat-transfer loop <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> having interconnected loop components comprising a) a heat-source heat exchanger <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, b) a generator heat exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and c) a pump for circulating a heat transfer fluid through the first loop components. As is apparent, the third fluid space <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> of heat exchange device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> becomes heat exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and transfers heat from heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (via exchanger <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>) to the strong solution in the first fluid space <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, i.e., the generator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, where desorption of refrigerant from the strong solution takes place. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 17</cross-reference>, a boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be added to the heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> heat-transfer loop to power heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises interconnected heat engine components comprising a boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as a scroll or gerotor expander, a condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for circulating a working fluid, preferably a low boiling organic compound, through the heat-engine components. The low boiling organic fluid not only offers the advantage of relatively low working temperatures but allows for the superheated organic fluid to be passed to a boiler pre-heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or otherwise used to capture work loss heat from the expander and one or more of the system pumps as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Such a configuration takes advantage of the fact that both the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be operated even when only one of the two heat sources, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, is available. Thus if heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a solar array and heat source <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is a gas-burner, both the heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can continue to function at night or during periods of inclement weather when the heat source solar array <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is not available for heat input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the heat engine condenser heat exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can also be added to the heat source loop. Here the heat-exchange fluid in loop <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> passes from heat source heat exchanger <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to either boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or generator heat exchanger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (third fluid space <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>) or both to provide heat to each. Provided that the heat exchange fluid is sufficiently cool after transferring heat to the generator, the cool exchange fluid may be passed to the heat engine condenser heat exchanger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to cool condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, advantage is taken of the availability of waste heat from absorber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> when the heat transfer device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is operating as a chiller for refrigeration purposes or in cooling mode for heat pump applications, by using a second heat-transfer loop <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The second heat-transfer loop <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> consists of interconnected second loop components comprising a) a boiler heat exchanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, b) at least one of 1) an absorption, heat-transfer device condenser heat exchanger <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and 2) an absorber heat exchanger <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and c) a pump <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for circulating a working fluid through said interconnected second loop components. Here rather than losing half of the heat source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and/or heat source <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> energy due to absorber and condenser heat expulsion to the environment, this heat is used to power boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which in turn drives the expander which provides useful work energy to operate pumps including water pumps for pumping water from underground reservoirs or to operate an electrical generator for electricity production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and especially <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference>, illustrate another embodiment of a dual heated generator which is designated generally by the numeral <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is used typically in an absorption heat transfer system (designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> where the generator is designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>) and comprises: 1) a first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> containing a working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>, 2) a second fluid space <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> in heat exchange relation with the first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and containing a first heat exchange fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>, and 3) a third fluid space <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> in heat exchange relation with the first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and containing a second heat exchange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fluid <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight>. Either the first heat exchange fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> or the second heat exchange fluid <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight> can be used to heat the working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> or both fluids <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight> can be used to heat simultaneously the working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. As noted previously, it is also possible that one of the heat exchange fluids can heat the working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> which in turn heats the other heat exchange fluid which is then used to heat a boiler of a heat-engine cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference>, the first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> for the working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is an annular space formed from an outer cylinder <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and an inner cylinder <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>.

The first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> containing the working fluid is also provided with inlet and outlet fluid tubes <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> may serve as either an inlet or outlet depending on the working fluid flow configuration within the first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, located in the lower portion of first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, serves as an inlet for incoming cold working fluid <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and tube <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, located in the upper portion of first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> serves as an outlet for exiting hot working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Dual heated generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can use either a natural gas flame or a hot fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> such as can be obtained from a solar collector as the heating source. That is, the generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can be powered by solar energy or natural gas separately or both simultaneously. When solar energy is sufficient, the generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can operate with using only hot solar fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, it can be supplemented with heat from combustion products <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight> of gas burner <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight>. When no solar energy is available, generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can be fired entirely with natural gas burner <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> employs a counter current flow arrangement between the solar fluid and a working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> such as lithium bromide and water, e.g., LiBr&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. Combustion products <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight> are in co-current flow with the working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. Generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> consists of two concentric cylinder shells <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> with fifty (50) fluted tubes vertically installed between shells <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. The size of the shells should depend on the target capacity of generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. For example, for a 25 RT (refrigeration ton) generator, the inner shell <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> has a 9 inch (22.9 cm) diameter and the outer shell <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> has an 11 inch (28.0 cm) diameter. It is essentially a shell-in-tube heat exchanger for the solar fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> side. The interior of fluted tubes <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> contains thermal transport fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> suitable for solar energy collection. Fluted tubes <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> are known for excellent heat transfer enhancement and easy fabrication. The LiBr&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O solution flows between the cylinder shells <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and around the fluted tubes <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> being directed by a series of baffle plates <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>six inches (15.2 cm) apart from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> A stainless steel-ceramic insert <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight> is placed in the inner shell <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, creating a circumferential gap (fluid space) <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> between the inner shell <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight>. Burner <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight>, with flame verification capability, is installed at the bottom of the inner shell <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. The high-temperature combustion product flue-gas flows upward through fluid space <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and transfers heat from the inner shell <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> to the LiBr&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> on the annulus side of the fluted tubes <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>. Inner shell <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> has a set of fins <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> brazed onto the exterior side of upper cylinder (shell) <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> to facilitate heat transfer from the hot combustion products <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, high concentration LiBr&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O working solution (57.5 wt %) enters the first fluid space <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> from bottom inlet <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> as a subcooled fluid <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Once heat is applied to the generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> with hot solar fluid <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> or flue gas <highlight><bold>584</bold></highlight>, the working solution <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> reaches an initial saturation point and then starts a boiling process that generates refrigerant vapor. This two-phase fluid is later separated into vapor and liquid components in a separator such as separator <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> where the vapor leaves the separator via outlet <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> and the weak hot working solution <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> leaves via outlet <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> illustrates a basic absorption cycle <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> in which the various generator embodiments of the current invention may be employed. As those skilled in the art will recognize, additional refinements may be made to the cycle to improve heat transfer efficiencies, as for example through the use of a double or triple effect heat transfer device. Although the cycle will be discussed in terms of a lithium bromide-water working solution, other refrigerant-absorbent solutions such as ammonia-water may also be employed with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Refrigerant vapor from the evaporator <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> passes through line <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> to absorber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> where it is absorbed in a weak working solution essentially devoid of refrigerant vapor returning from generator <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. The absorption process takes place with the liberation of heat Q to form a strong solution that leaves the absorber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> where pump <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> pumps it into line <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. The relatively cool strong solution passes into heat exchanger <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> where heat from the hot weak working solution coming from generator <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is transferred to the strong solution to begin the absorption process. The partially heated strong solution passes from heat exchanger <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> to the generator <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. In generator <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, the strong solution from line <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> is heated by means of heat source Q-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or heat source Q-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or both. As noted previously Q-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be a hot solar fluid from a solar collection array while Q-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could be the combustion products from a natural gas burner. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, other sources of heat may also be used for Q-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> although preferably, the generator of the present invention is designed for used with an energy source Q-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is only intermittently available, e.g., solar energy, and a second alternate energy source Q-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is always available to supplement the initial intermit energy source when ft is available in insufficient quantities or not at all. Heating proceeds to drive off the refrigerant vapor from the working solution which leaves the generator via line <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight>. The hot weak solution, devoid of refrigerant vapor, leaves the desorber <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> where it passes to heat exchanger <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> in which it heats the cold strong working solution coming from the absorber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The cooled weak solution then passes to an expansion valve <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> after which the low pressure solution passes to the absorber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> where it is combined with refrigerant vapor coming from evaporator <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> via <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> to again repeat the absorption/desorption cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Returning to generator <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, the desorbed vapor passes to the condenser <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> where it condenses to a liquid with the liberation of heat Q. The cool liquid then leaves the condenser via line <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> where it passed to an expansion valve <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> after which it passes to the evaporator <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>.

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>, generator <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> comprises a first fluid space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> which is an annular space formed from by the exterior of cylinder <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight>, the interior of cylinder <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight>, and a portion of base <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. Annular space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> has an inlet <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> for incoming and outgoing working fluid <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>, respectively. Generator <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> also has a second fluid space <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> in heat exchange relation with first fluid space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The second fluid space <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is an annular space formed from by the exterior of cylinder <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight>, the interior of cylinder <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight>, an annular top <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight>, and a portion of base <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. The second fluid space <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> has an inlet <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> for a first heating fluid such as a solar heating fluid heated by an array of solar collectors. A third fluid space <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is also in heat exchange relation with the first fluid space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and is in the form of an annular space formed from the interior of cylinder <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight>, an exterior of cylinder <highlight><bold>748</bold></highlight> and a portion of base <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. A fossil fuel burner <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> is located in the base portion of the third fluid space <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> A separator <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> for separating the refrigerant vapor from the working solution has an inlet connection <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> from the first fluid space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, a vapor outlet <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, and an outlet <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> for weak solution <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight>. The design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> uses a plate fin type construction. Three concentric shells or cylinders <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight> are used with only the fluid space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> containing the working solution being a pressure vessel. The three concentric shells or cylinders <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight> form three different annuluses, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The LiBr-water annulus <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, i.e., the first fluid space <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, is between the flue gas (combustion product) annulus <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, i.e., the third fluid space <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, and the circulating fluid annulus <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, i.e., the second fluid space <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. When combustion product (flue gas) heating <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> is used, the LiBr&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O working solution <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> is heated from the inside and when a circulating fluid <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, e.g., solar fluid <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, is used, the LiBr&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O is heated from the outside. A modified plate fin is used between each shell. The entire assembly is oven brazed to provide contact between each fin and the appropriate shells. Because the entire assembly is brazed, the shells can be fabricated of thinner material than normally would be used. In the flue gas annulus <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, standard straight and offset strip fins are used. Offset strip fins can be used in the circulating fluid annulus. Fins in the LiBr annulus promote two phase flow with a minimum pressure drop. </paragraph>

The heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has interconnected heat engine components comprising a) a boiler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, b) an expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, c) a heat-engine condenser <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and d) a pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for circulating a working fluid through said interconnected components of said heat engine. The compression heat-transfer device <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> has interconnected compression heat-transfer device components comprising a) a compression device evaporator <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, b) a compression device condenser <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and c) a throttling valve <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and c) a compressor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for compressing a compression working fluid circulating through the interconnected components of the compression heat-transfer device <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and compression heat-transfer device are joined by a common shaft <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> driven by the heat-engine expander <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and driving the compression heat-transfer device compressor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Typically the close-coupled expander and compressor are either expander and compressor scroll units or expander and compressor gerotor units as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/163,491 filed Nov. 17, 1998 (PCT publication WO 00/29720) all of which is herein incorporated by reference as if completely written herein, and are hermetically sealed in a single unit. The boiler can be heated with any heat source such as fossil fuels but is especially useful for low temperature fuels such as solar arrays, bio-mass, and waste heat. To take advantage of low energy fuel use, a low boiling organic fluid or ammonia is used as the working fluid in either unit. Ammonia has been found to be especially useful when used in both the heat engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and energy transfer device <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
