<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> We have now found that administration of an adenosine A1 agonist in conjunction with an opioid is beneficial in the treatment of conditions associated with pain and in alleviating the symptoms associated therewith. </paragraph>

The use of combinations of the present invention may alternatively and/or additionally reduce side effects compared to administration of a single compound. Drug efficacy may be assessed using pain models such as carrageenan model (Guilbaud G. &amp; Kayser V. Pain 28 (1987) 99-107) for acute inflammatory pain, FCA model (Freund&apos;s Complete Adjuvant) (Hay et al., Neuroscience Vol 78, No 3 pp843-850, 1997) for chronic inflammatory pain, or CCI model (Chronic Constriction Injury) (Bennett, G.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous e.g. by injection or by depot tablet, intradermal, intrathecal, intramuscular e.g. by depot and intravenous), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal and sublingual) or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation administration, although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the compounds (&ldquo;active ingredient&rdquo;) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Preferably such compositions will be formulated for oral administration. It will be appreciated that when the two active ingredients are administered independently, each may be administered by different means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets (e.g. chewable tablets in particular for paediatric administration) each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a other conventional excipients such as binding agents, (for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone) or hydroxymethyl cellulose or hydroxymethyl cellulose fillers (for example, lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate or sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycollate) or wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. The tablets may be coated according to methods well-known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents such as sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; and preservatives such as methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid. Such preparations may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for example, water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter, hard fat or polyethylene glycol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For topical administration to the epidermis, the compounds may be formulated as creams, gels, ointments or lotions or as a transdermal patch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> For intranasal administration the compounds of the invention may be used, for example as a liquid spray, as a powder or in the form of drops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For administration by inhalation the compounds according to the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurised packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. 1,1,1,2-trifluoroethane (HFA 134A) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3, -heptapropane (HFA 227), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol the dosage until may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established diseases or symptoms. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The formulations according to the invention may contain between 0.1-99% of the active ingredient, conveniently from 30-95% for tablets and capsules and 3-50% for liquid preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be prepared by conventional techniques. When combined in the same formulation for example, the adenosine A1 agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof and an opioid or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof may be admixed together, if desired, with suitable excipients. Tablets may be prepared, for example, by direct compression of such a mixture. Capsules may be prepared, for example by filling the blend together with suitable excipients into gelatin capsules, using a suitable filling machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Compositions for use according to the invention may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredients. The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. Where the compounds are intended for administration as two separate compositions these may be presented, for example, in the form of a twin pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prescribed to the patient in &ldquo;patient packs&rdquo; containing the whole course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacists divides a patients supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in traditional prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physicians instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the administration of the combination of the invention by means of a single patient pack, or patients packs of each composition, including a package insert directing the patient to the correct use of the invention is a desirable additional feature of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a patient pack comprising at least one active ingredient, of the combination according to the invention and an information insert containing directions on the use of the combination of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect the invention provides a double pack comprising in association for separate administration an adenosine A1 agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof and an opioid or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the dose at which the adenosine A1 agonist and the opioid is administered will depend on the age and condition of the patient and the frequency and route of administration and will be at the ultimate discretion of the attendant physician. The active ingredients may conveniently be presented in unit dose form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A proposed dose of adenosine A1 agonist and the opioid agonist for administration to man (of approximately 70 kg body weight) may conveniently be administered at doses within the normal range taught in the art at which the compounds are therapeutically effective. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Male Random Hooded rats (180-220 g) were used. The test compound or vehicle was administered 30 mins before the 2nd test compound or vehicle. The test compounds and vehicles used were: (i) Compound A in 0.25% methyl cellulose and (ii) Morphine was made up in saline. Compound A was administered orally. Morphine was administered subcutaneously. After a further 30 mins 100 ul of 2% carrageenan was injected intraplantar into the left hind paw and the animals were then returned to their cages. Three hours later behavioural testing of the carrageenan-induced decrease in weight on the inflamed left hind paw (% weight on the inflammed left hind paw) and associated oedema was assessed. Weight bearing was measured using the dual channel weight averager and paw oedema was assessed using a plethysmometer. The dual channel weight averager is commercially available and is described in the following abstract: Validation of the dual channel weight averager as an instrument for the measurement of inflammatory pain, N.
