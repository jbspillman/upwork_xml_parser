<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a sectional view schematically showing an example of a conventional Stirling refrigerating machine. First, the structure of this conventional Stirling refrigerating machine will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical space formed inside it, and, in this space, a displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are arranged so as to form a compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, between which a regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is provided to form a closed circuit. This closed circuit has its working space filled with working gas such as helium, and the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made to reciprocate along its axis (in the direction marked F) by an external power source such as a linear motor (not shown) or the like. The reciprocating movement of the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes periodic pressure variations in the working gas sealed in the working space, and causes the displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to reciprocate along its axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A displacer rod <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> penetrating the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is, at one end, fixed to the displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and, at the other end, connected to a spring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reciprocates along its axis inside the cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the same period as but with a different phase from the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As the displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> move with an appropriate phase difference kept between them, the working gas sealed in the working space forms a thermodynamic cycle well-known as the reversed Stirling cycle, and produces cold mainly in the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is a matrix of fine wire or a ring-shaped gap formed by wounding foil. As the working gas moves from the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> receives heat from the working gas and stores the heat. As the working gas returns from the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> returns the heat stored in it to the working gas. Thus, the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> serves to store heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> represents a high-temperature-side heat exchanger, through which part of the heat generated when the working gas is compressed in the compression space is rejected to outside. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> represents a low-temperature-side heat exchanger, through which heat is taken in from outside when the working gas expands in the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Now, how this structure works will be described briefly below. When compressed by the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the working gas in the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> moves, as indicated by the solid-line arrow A in the figure, through the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the heat of the working gas is rejected through the high-temperature-side heat exchanger <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to outside, and thus the working gas is precooled as the result of its heat being stored in the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When most of the working gas has flowed into the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it starts expanding, and produces cold in the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Next, the working gas moves, as indicated by the broken-line arrow B in the figure, through the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> back to the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the working gas takes in heat from outside through the low-temperature-side heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and collects the heat stored in the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> half a cycle ago before entering the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When most of the working gas has returned to the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it starts being compressed again, and thus proceeds to the next cycle. This cycle is repeated continuously, and cryogenic cold is thereby produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this structure, the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is realized, for example, with film of polyester or the like wound in a cylindrical shape. However, here, variations are inevitable in the gaps between different layers of the film so wound, and therefore, when such a regenerator is incorporated in a Stirling refrigerating machine, most of the working gas flows through where the gaps are relatively large, and little of it flows elsewhere, making the flow of the working gas through the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> uneven. This makes it impossible to use the whole regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> effectively for heat storage, and thus lowers regenerated heat exchange efficiency, degrading the performance of the Stirling refrigerating machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The working gas sealed in the cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sometimes contains moisture, and the moisture may freeze inside the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and stick to the displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, causing friction between the displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and thereby hindering smooth sliding. This, too, degrades the performance of the Stirling refrigerating machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The moisture may also condense inside the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and flow into the gaps between different layers of the film, hindering the flow of the working gas through those gaps and thereby making it impossible to use the whole regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> effectively for heat storage. This, too, degrades the performance of the Stirling refrigerating machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view schematically showing a Stirling refrigerating machine according to the invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the flow uniformizer used in the Stirling refrigerating machine according to the invention. It is to be noted that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, such members as are found also in the conventional Stirling refrigerating machine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are identified with the same reference numerals, and their detailed explanations will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> differs from that of the conventional Stirling refrigerating machine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> only in that flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are additionally provided contiguous with the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, one on the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side thereof and another on the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side thereof. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the invention is a doughnut-shaped member having a thickness of about 1 mm to 5 mm. The flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a filter made of, for example, polyurethane foam, and the fineness of its mesh is so set as to produce the desired pressure loss between the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when the flow path for the working gas is formed by coupling the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, high-temperature-side heat exchanger <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, low-temperature-side heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the Stirling refrigerating machine structured in this way is operated, as indicated by the arrow A or B in the figure, the working gas moves from one of the compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the other. Meanwhile, the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which provides resistance to the working gas passing through it, makes the working gas disperse all around the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while passing through it. Thus, after passing through the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the working gas has substantially uniform flow speed at the entrance of the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Thus, the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, by making the working gas flow uniformly all around the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, achieves an adequate flow uniformizing effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows the coefficient of performance (COP) of the Stirling refrigerating machine as observed when the flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided and when they are not (i.e. as in the conventional example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Here, the temperature conditions are assumed to be 30&deg; C. at the high-temperature side (compression space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side) and &minus;23&deg; C. at the low-temperature side (expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side).

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Table 1 clearly shows that providing the flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> makes the flow of the working gas passing through the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> uniform, and thereby permits the whole regenerator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be used effectively for heat storage, with the result that the Stirling refrigerating machine offers enhanced performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Needless to say, the flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be made of any other material than polyurethane foam to achieve the same effects, as long as they have adequate mesh not to produce an extremely high pressure loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, by making the flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a highly moisture-absorbing, water-absorbing material, it is possible, in addition to making the flow of the working gas uniform, to remove moisture contained in the working gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Examples of such materials include: fiber of cotton, wool, silk, rayon, acetate, cellulose, hydrophilic or hydrophobic polyester, or moisture-absorbing or water-absorbing nylon; super absorbent high polymer materials such as fiber based on cross-linked polyacrylates; and porous materials such as zeolite, silica, diatomaceous earth, allophane, alumina-silica, zirconium phosphate, and porous metal materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Of these materials, a material in fiber form is formed into a flat sheet, honeycomb, corrugate sheet, or the like; on the other hand, a material in non-fiber form is sintered into a doughnut shape, or its powder is sandwiched between pieces of nonwoven cloth together with a binder and fixed. In one of these ways, the moisture-absorbing flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shaped as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> can be easily produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thus produced are dried to an adequate degree, and are then arranged inside the Stirling refrigerating machine as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This makes it possible to absorb moisture contained in the working gas and, even if the moisture condenses, to absorb the water quickly. Thus, it is possible to prevent the moisture from freezing at the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side and sticking to the displacer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the like, and thereby prevent degradation of the refrigerating performance of the Stirling refrigerating machine, or it is possible to prevent the moisture from condensing in the expansion space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and stopping the gaps between different layers of the film of the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and thereby prevent degradation of the refrigerating performance. Instead of giving a single flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> both the ability to make working gas flow uniform and the ability to absorb moisture, it is also possible to build a flow uniformizer and a moisture-absorber each separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by making the flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of zeolite, filter paper, or the like, it is possible, in addition to making the flow of the working gas uniform and absorbing moisture and water as described above, to absorb and remove impurities such as particles shaved off the components through which the working gas reciprocates or particles of a coating agent or the like flaked off the surface of those components. This makes it possible to prevent the impurities from causing the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to clog and degrading the performance of the Stirling refrigerating machine. Instead of giving a single flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the ability to make working gas flow uniform, the ability to absorb moisture, and the ability to filter out impurities all together, it is also possible to combine together two among a flow uniformizer, a moisture-absorber, and a filter, or to build them each separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by making the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a material having an adequate heat capacity (for example, a material based on polyester), it is possible to store heat not only in the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> but, for a certain amount of heat, also in the flow uniformizer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This helps enhance regenerated heat exchange efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiment described above deals with a case where flow uniformizers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided on both the expansion-space <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and compression-space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> sides of the regenerator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, they do not necessarily have to be provided on both sides; that is, it is also possible to provide one flow uniformizer on one side. This helps reduce the number of components needed and thereby reduce costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, flow uniformizing means for making the flow of a working medium uniform is provided contiguous with a regenerator forming a flow path of the working medium reciprocating between an expansion space and a compression space formed inside a cylinder of a Stirling refrigerating machine. This alleviates the unevenness of the flow of the working medium passing through the regenerator, leading to enhanced regenerated heat exchange efficiency and thus to enhanced performance of the Stirling refrigerating machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the present invention, the flow uniformizing means is shared as moisture-absorbing means for removing moisture contained in the working medium. This makes it possible to prevent degradation of refrigerating performance resulting from the moisture freezing at the expansion space side, or to prevent degradation of refrigerating performance resulting from the moisture condensing in the expansion space and stopping the gaps between different layers of the film of the regenerator. </paragraph>
