</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an industrial plant, in particular a power station for generating energy, having a container for operational equipment for operating plant components. The invention also relates to a container for operational equipment for such a plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> To operate and control the plant, that is to say to operate plant components and plant processes, different electrical apparatuses are normally arranged in a room for operational equipment. The electrical apparatuses are, for example, items of electrical equipment such as a transformer, an apparatus for low-voltage distribution or for direct-current distribution, a rectifier, batteries, etc. The term &ldquo;electrical apparatus&rdquo; also refers to a complete control room facility. Since, in particular, complex instrumentation and control apparatuses for controlling the plant processes are also accommodated in the room for operational equipment, complicated cabling between the individual apparatuses in the room for operational equipment and with plant components and decentralized instrumentation and control apparatuses outside the room for operational equipment is necessary. The conventional plant concept in this case is that the electrical apparatuses are only installed on site in a fixed room for operational equipment integrated in a building section of the plant. Accordingly, the electrical apparatuses must be connected to one another in-situ on the plant. On account of personnel who are often inadequately trained, there is a relatively large potential for errors here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The aim of more recent efforts has been to design rooms for operational equipment as containers for operational equipment which have standardized electrical apparatuses which are already connected to one another in a prefabricated manner in the container. The container for operational equipment is already assembled at the factory by trained personnel skilled in the art. For simple and faultless connection of the container for operational equipment in-situ, this container has in particular standardized connections. A container for operational equipment designed as a control-center portable cabin has been disclosed by the technical information brochure of Siemens AG (Germany), automation technology sector, date of publication 08/97, with the title &ldquo;Leitstellenraumzelle in Fertigbauweise&rdquo; &lsqb;control-center portable cabin in prefabricated type of construction&rsqb;. All the installations necessary for the operation of a control center are fitted in a prefabricated manner in this control-center portable cabin. This comprises both technical apparatuses and office facilities including sanitary facilities and conference rooms. The control-center portable cabin is delivered ready for operation and only needs to be connected in-situ to a few installation lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An air-conditioning system is required in order to ensure the operability of the container for operational equipment, this air-conditioning system keeping the temperature in the container at a desired value. Since a failure of the air-conditioning system may possibly lead to a failure of the apparatuses in the container and thus to a failure of the plant control, the air-conditioning system is normally of redundant design for safety reasons. This has the disadvantage of relatively high costs for the air conditioning. Conventional electrically operated air-conditioning systems are normally provided for the container, these air-conditioning systems being arranged on the roof of the container. Depending on the requisite air-conditioning capacity of the air-conditioning system, the power consumption varies and may have a noticeably adverse effect on the operating result of the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This applies in particular to small plants for the generation of electricity, the generator output of which is limited in particular to 5 MW. This is because, on account of statutory requirements (power supply law), it is currently possible to achieve a relatively high price per energy unit for electricity generated with such small power plants. The aim is therefore to keep the power consumption inside the plant as low as possible, so that, with a limited generator output, a maximum proportion of the generated output can be fed into the network. The high power consumption caused in particular by the redundant design of the air-conditioning system noticeably reduces the efficiency of the plant. In this case, the expression &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; refers to the proportion of the electrical output provided by the generator compared with the electrical output fed into the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to permit as high an efficiency of the plant as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To achieve this object, according to the invention an industrial plant, in particular a power station for generating energy, has a number of plant components, a cooling circuit as a reservoir for thermal energy obtained during a plant process, and a container for operational equipment which is designed as a separate construction unit. At least one electrical apparatus for operating the plant components is arranged in the container for operational equipment. For air-conditioning the container for operational equipment, an air-conditioning system is provided which is connected to the cooling circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the fundamental idea of having recourse to a cooling circuit present in the plant as a reservoir for the air-conditioning of the container for operational equipment. In this case, the term &ldquo;reservoir&rdquo; refers to a heat accumulator with a storage medium which is suitable for storing, that is for absorbing and delivering, thermal energy. Depending on the temperature level in the reservoir, this reservoir, for the air-conditioning of the container for operational equipment, may be used both for cooling and for heating. The decisive advantage of using a reservoir which is fed with thermal energy obtained during the plant process consists in the fact that the electrical energy required for the air conditioning is reduced virtually to zero. The energy required for the air conditioning is provided virtually from the &ldquo;waste energy&rdquo; obtained during the plant operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The design of the container for operational equipment as a separate construction unit has the advantage that the container for operational equipment can be brought to the plant in a prefabricated state and can be connected there quickly and simply to plant components without great installation outlay. The air-conditioning system is preferably already pre-installed in the container. In particular the commissioning times and thus the investment costs of the plant are favorably influenced by the container solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The cooling circuit with its cooling medium, in particular cooling water, is especially suitable as a reservoir. Such a cooling circuit is necessary in a multiplicity of plants for operating different plant components. In particular in a plant for generating thermal energy (power station) in which water is heated, the latter must be directed and cooled in a circuit for a sufficiently high efficiency. In the process, a not inconsiderable proportion of the thermal energy is generally given off to the environment, this proportion of thermal energy being advantageously used for operating the air-conditioning system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the plant for generating energy, a main cooling circuit and in addition a secondary cooling circuit with a reduced thermal capacity compared with the main cooling circuit are provided as a rule. Since the capacity is as a rule a multiple of the thermal capacity required for the air conditioning, the air-conditioning system&mdash;in particular for reasons of standardization&mdash;is preferably connected to this secondary cooling circuit. The secondary cooling circuit serves, for example, to cool turbine oil or to cool the generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The thermal capacity of the cooling circuit, that is to say the thermal capacity provided by the reservoir, is preferably substantially higher than that of the air-conditioning system. This ensures that the air-conditioning system does not influence the cooling capacity. With such dimensioning, the air-conditioning system can be fitted in existing plants without any problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an especially simple and thus also robust and cost-effective configuration, the air-conditioning system preferably has a water/air heat exchanger. The thermal energy stored in the cooling water of the cooling circuit is therefore delivered via such a heat exchanger to the air in the container for operational equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an especially expedient configuration, the cooling circuit has both a heat source and a heat sink. This has the advantage that the cooling circuit acting as heat reservoir can be used both for heating and for cooling the container. To this end, the heat source and heat sink preferably have different temperatures. The heat source is formed in the cooling circuit in particular by the return of the cooling medium into a cooling tower, and the heat sink is formed by the feed of the cooling medium from the cooling tower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To set a suitable capacity of the air-conditioning system, a switching unit is preferably provided, via which the air-conditioning system is connected to the heat source and the heat sink. In this case, the switching unit serves either to perform a switching operation between the heat source and the heat sink or to intermix the thermal energy provided in each case by the heat source and the heat sink in a suitable manner in accordance with the current requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a preferred design, a regulating device is provided, via which the capacity of the air-conditioning system is automatically set as a function of the temperature in the room for operational equipment. With this regulating device, the temperature in the room for operational equipment or in the container is therefore advantageously regulated to a predetermined desired temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For as high a degree of flexibility as possible when setting up and when exchanging the container for operational equipment, this container is set up so as to be movable and to this end has travel means. These travel means are, for example, wheels or rollers or devices provided for attaching wheels or rollers. The container is preferably mounted on rails or stilts via wheels. This facilitates the positioning and in particular the exchange of the container. In particular, provision is made for standardized containers for operational equipment, so that the container for operational equipment can be exchanged for another in a simple manner. In the event of failure of electrical apparatuses, for example control apparatuses, arranged in the container, the latter can therefore simply be completely exchanged. The downtime of the plant is thus reduced to a minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In an especially advantageous manner, the plant is designed for generating energy, the maximum electrical output which can be generated being limited to a few MW, in particular to 5 MW. In such a plant, the energy-saving configuration of the air-conditioning system becomes especially apparent. As a result, the efficiency of the plant, compared with the use of a conventional air-conditioning system, is increased and the operating result is improved. This is true in particular on account of the specifications applying to such small plants, according to which a high output per energy unit generated can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the object is also achieved by a container for operational equipment which has an air-conditioning system and a connection for connecting the air-conditioning system to a cooling circuit as a reservoir for thermal energy obtained during a plant process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the container for operational equipment can be gathered from the subclaims. The container for operational equipment is characterized in particular by a modular and standardized construction. The expedient configurations and advantages recited with regard to the plant are accordingly also to be applied to the container.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plant for generating energy comprises a thermal energy-generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a condenser <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a cooling tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a plurality of heat exchangers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged in a secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment with an air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a switching unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected to the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The thermal energy-generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises, for example, a combustion chamber and a steam generator for generating steam. The latter is fed via a steam line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and drives the latter. The turbine rotation is transmitted via a shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for generating electrical energy. The steam line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> leads from the turbine to the condenser <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, where the steam is condensed. The condenser <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is integrated in a main cooling circuit and is connected to the cooling tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> belonging to the cooling circuit. The steam condensed in the condenser <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is fed as feedwater to the energy-generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a feedwater line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The feedwater line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and steam line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> form a water/steam circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent, for example, overheating of plant components, such as the generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for example, during operation of the plant, the heat exchangers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, via which the temperature of such plant components is regulated, are provided in the secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with integrated cooling tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> forms a reservoir for thermal energy. This reservoir draws its energy on the one hand from the plant process and on the other hand by heat exchange with the environment. The thermal energy contained in the reservoir is therefore provided essentially from waste heat from the energy-generating process. The secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a feed <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as heat sink and a return <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as heat source. Typically, the feed temperature in the secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is 25&deg; C. and the return temperature is 35&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Such moderate temperatures are especially suitable for the air-conditioning of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment. The air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is therefore supplied with thermal energy from the secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To this end, cooling water is fed via the switching unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the feed <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via a cold-water line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and to the return <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via a hot-water line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The switching unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises a valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, in particular a 3-way valve. With the latter, the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can alternatively be supplied with hot water or with cold water or with a mixture, in order to achieve a suitable air-conditioning capacity of the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to the switching unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via a mixing line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This mixing line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via a connection <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> on the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment. From a further connection <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, a return line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> leads from the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably arranged in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment, this temperature sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> being connected to a regulating device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The regulating device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> controls the 3-way valve as a function of the measured actual temperature in order to set a desired temperature. The regulating device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in particular provides for automatic control of the temperature in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to keep the installation work in-situ on the plant to a minimum, the switching unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the regulating device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are preferably integrated in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment. In this case, three connections <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for pipelines are arranged on the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment, to be precise one for the cold-water line, one for the hot-water line and one for the return line. The mixing line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be omitted in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The connection between the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes it possible to both cool and heat the interior space of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment. Since the air-conditioning system has recourse to residual or waste energy and to energy from the environment, it requires virtually no electrical energy. Electrical energy is only required in order to control it. It goes without saying that, depending on the type of plant, a heating circuit may also be used instead of a cooling circuit or in order to supplement the latter. If the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment is set up as a control room, the temperature is set as a rule to room temperature, that is to say to about 22&deg; C. Since only temperatures within a range of between about 25&deg; C. and 30&deg; C. can be achieved as a rule with the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via the secondary cooling circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an additional conventional air-conditioning system provided with low capacity is sufficient for this application in order to cool the temperature in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment down to 22&deg; C. Compared with conventional full-air conditioning, with a conventional air-conditioning system, the conventional air-conditioning system used here is of markedly smaller construction and need not be of redundant design. If it serves as an operational-equipment room for electrical components, the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set in such a way that the temperature does not exceed 35&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a simple water/air heat exchanger <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of robust design, which is arranged in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air conditioning is therefore effected by water cooling or water heating. This design, compared with conventional air-conditioning systems in which conditioned air is injected, is less susceptible to faults. In addition, due to this robust configuration, the air-conditioning system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is largely trouble-free and very easy to maintain. In addition to the low operating costs (low energy costs, low maintenance cost), only low installation costs arise due to the simple configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Arranged in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment are a plurality of electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which, for operating and controlling the plant, are connected via plug-and-socket connections <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to different plant components, such as, for example, the energy-generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a rule, the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are different components. For example, they form a control room facility and comprise the instrumentation and control or a switching system. They serve, for example, for the low-voltage distribution, for the direct-current distribution, for rectification and to this end are configured, inter alia, as transformers or batteries. The individual electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are preferably prefabricated and standardized and are already cabled with one another before the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment is set up. On the plant, only the connection of the individual plant components is still necessary. To this end, the plug-and-socket connections <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are standardized, that is to say in particular prefabricated and coded, so that incorrect connection is ruled out. In addition to the electrical apparatuses, an office facility (not show), for example, is also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are preferably matched to one another and standardized in such a way that the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment can be used for different plants. The complicated, plant-specific configuring of the individual components of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment is therefore dispensed with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment has travel means in the form of wheels <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, via which it is mounted on rails <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in a movable and easily displaceable manner. The rails <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are integrated in stilts <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, by means of which a clearance space is formed below the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment, and installation lines can be laid in this clearance space, in particular on &ldquo;cable racks&rdquo;. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment is arranged on the stilts <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so as to be laterally displaceable. Alternatively, it can also be mounted so as to be displaceable in its longitudinal direction. On account of the set-up of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for operational equipment on rails <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be pushed into position and pulled out in a simple manner, as a result of which its installation costs are kept low. In addition, this makes it possible, in combination with the standardization, to quickly exchange the complete container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as a result of which the downtime of the plant can be kept short in the event of a fault. A further advantage of the container solution with pre-installed electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be seen in the fact that the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the items of electrical equipment serves both as packing and as transport security and protects the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> during the entire operating period of the plant. </paragraph>
