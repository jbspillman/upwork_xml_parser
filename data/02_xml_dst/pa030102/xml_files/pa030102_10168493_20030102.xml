<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Arranged along a path of movement of a gripper are friction blocks on which a slewing ring of the gripper rolls, whereby the gripper with the component is rotated. This allows the component to be rotated into its approximate placement position in a time-saving manner before the position is measured, during the forward movement of the gripper. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an insertion head comprising at least one rotational device for electric components, the turret-like insertion head having a stator and a rotor, on &lsqb;lacuna&rsqb; a multiplicity of circularly distributed grippers are mounted independently rotatably about a placement axis, the insertion head having an optical measuring device for detecting the position of the components held on the grippers and it being possible after the optical measurement for the components to be rotated by a fine rotational device precisely into the required placement position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known from EP-C 0 315 799 to provide an insertion device with a movable turret head, in which the grippers provided with suction pipettes are arranged protruding in a star-shaped manner on a rotor. A stator of the insertion head is provided with peripherally distributed processing stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is customary to design one of these stations as an optical measuring station, in which the rotational position of the previously received component is ascertained. In a following rotational station, the position of the component is changed in a way corresponding to the desired installation position. This change comprises a coarse rotation, for example in steps of 45&deg;, corresponding to the desired installation position and a fine rotation, which compensates for the picking inaccuracy when the components are received from a feeding device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is also customary to provide the gripper with a disk-like slewing ring of relatively large diameter. On this, a friction wheel of the rotational device can be radially mounted, whereupon the rotational device is activated and brings about a precise rotation of the gripper by a precalculated angle. Since the components are to be placed onto the printed circuit board in different installation positions, the angle of rotation can be so large that the entire rotational cycle lasts longer than the operating cycles at other stations of the turret head, as a result of which the insertion capacity of the latter is correspondingly limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the object of reducing the time loss when the grippers are rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by the invention as claimed in claim 1. The rotation of the gripper is now divided into two stages, the coarse rotation taking place rapidly, without being especially accurate, in a rotor segment before &lsqb;lacuna&rsqb; optical measuring device. Even in the case of a large overall angle of rotation, this allows the angle of rotation in the fine rotational device to be shortened to such an extent that the fine adjustment does not taken longer than, for example, than the optical measurement in the measuring device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Advantageous developments of the invention are characterized in the subclaims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The development as claimed in claim 2 has the effect that the measurement and fine rotation of the components take place at a standstill. The measuring station and fine rotational station as well as the coarse rotational station as claimed in claim 3 are fastened in a simple way on the stator and can enter into a precise operative connection with the component or with the gripper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The frictional surface as claimed in claim 4 has the effect that the coarse rotation takes place during the in any case required forward movement of the gripper, without any time loss. The stationary frictional surface may be formed on a simple structural part, on which the slewing ring keeps rolling until the desired end position is at least approximately reached. The length of engagement between the frictional surface and the slewing ring can be accurately terminated by a radial infeed movement of the rotational device, for example with the aid of piezoelectric drive elements of short response time, so that the gripper can be rotated by the calculated angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The development as claimed in claim 5 makes it possible to carry out the coarse rotation with little control effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The friction block as claimed in claim 6 represents a simple, easy-to-actuate component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The development as claimed in claim 7 makes it possible to form the length of the frictional surfaces such that an angle of rotation of, for example, 45&deg; is respectively achieved at the gripper. It is possible for the angle of rotation to be multiplied by providing a corresponding number of the friction blocks, adjusted in a switchable manner into the path of movement of the slewing ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The development as claimed in claim 8 ensures that the grippers can be moved with the slewing rings along a precisely defined path. For example, in the case of a star-shaped turret head with radially protruding grippers, the slewing rings move within a plane, so that the friction blocks can also be arranged in a plane, which is accompanied by assembly advantages. The shortening of the friction blocks ensures that each frictional surface is respectively covered only by one slewing ring. This allows them to be rotated differently and individually in accordance with the specified requirement.</paragraph>

<brief-description-of-drawings>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention is explained in more detail below on the basis of an exemplary embodiment represented in the drawing. </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a turret-head-like insertion head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a stator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The insertion head can be moved over a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and has grippers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> protruding radially in a star-shaped manner, which are provided with suction pipettes, on the free ends of which electric components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are held. The rotor can be rotated step by step by an index angle, which corresponds to the pitch angle of the grippers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The grippers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be pushed out telescopically from the rotor. The gripper <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is respectively in the placement position can consequently place the component <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> onto the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the perpendicular direction of the arrow represented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The rotatably mounted grippers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are provided with slewing rings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed in the manner of disks. An optical measuring station <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> serves for measuring the position of the components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with respect to the gripper <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Fitted on the stator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> along the path of movement of the slewing rings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are friction blocks <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which can be deflected in the horizontal direction of the arrow to the extent that their frictional surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be placed onto the slewing rings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated, the slewing rings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> consequently roll with their lateral surfaces on the frictional surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and are correspondingly rotated. This rotation takes place in a time-saving manner between the holding stations of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The length of the friction blocks <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is dimensioned such that the grippers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are respectively rotated by, for example, 45&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By switching the brake block infeed on and off, the gripper can be rotated by a desired multiple of the coarse angle of rotation. Following this coarse rotation, the components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are measured in the optical station and their deviation from the installation position is determined. A following fine rotational device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assigned to one of the holding stations. In it, the rotational position of the gripper <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be changed in fine stages and the desired installation position of the component can also be corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The friction blocks <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are part of a coarse rotational device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and are connected to the latter via piezoelectric drive elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which adjust the friction blocks <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the direction of the slewing ring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Instead of the coarse rotational device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the friction blocks <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a coarse rotational station (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), indicated by dash-dotted lines, may be arranged on the stator at a holding station of the grippers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is designed in the same way as the fine rotational station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
