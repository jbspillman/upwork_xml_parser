<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">With a model for creating a prototype (rapid prototyping), two components (A, B) are mixed inside a mixer (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of a traversing application head and the resulting model-building mass is ejected from the nozzle (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the application head. As a result, the prototype is constructed in layers. The two components react with each other and increase in volume, so that the layers of the prototype can be relatively large, approximately 1-5 cm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A plurality of so-called rapid prototyping methods of this type is known, all of which use a synthetic material for constructing a prototype in layers (e.g. see magazine &ldquo;INDUSTRIEANZEIGER&rdquo; &lsqb;Industry Advertising Journal&rsqb; 47-48/97, pp 52-64). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As a result of constantly decreasing product cycles, the rapid prototyping method increasingly gains in importance. The layer-type construction generally occurs fully automatic, wherein the control signals are gained from a 3-D CAD data set. Methods used so far are relatively slow and can be used only for small prototypes. Constructing prototypes with a volume in the order of magnitude starting at 1 m<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>is practically impossible. As a result, large-volume prototypes such as automobile prototypes on a scale of 1:1 must still be constructed primarily with mechanical methods and with a correspondingly high expenditure in materials and costs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a device for realizing the method according to the invention. The device is provided with an application head attached to an overhead gantry <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The application head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of a mixer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A suitable mixer/nozzle unit is described in the following with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Two components A and B, respectively located inside tanks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, are initially conveyed with the two low-pressure conveying systems <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the two high-pressure pumps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The high-pressure pumps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which are driven with the aid of two servomotors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via electromagnetic linear units and which operate based on the double-action piston-pump principle, pump the components with a system pressure of 100-200 bar to the mixer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The delivery pressure level is detected with the aid of pressure sensors and the values transmitted to the central computer. The pulsation in the connected lines is smoothed by means of nitrogen bubbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The components are mixed inside the mixer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and exit through the nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The components A and B react chemically, which leads to a volume increase of the substance. The application head traverses all three spatial directions, so that a prototype is built up in layers. The foam formed with the two components A and B achieves its final volume so rapidly and develops such a high starting rigidity that for each passage of the application head a new layer can be deposited on the previously created foam layer. The thickness of each foam layer in this case is approximately between 1 and 5 cm. A central computer controls the complete system, wherein the control signals are generated from a CAD data set. It is important that the mixing head movement on its spatial curve is synchronized with the pumping capacity of the high-pressure pumps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. For an exact control of the respective amounts to be pumped and thus also the mixing ratio of the two high-pressure pumps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, it is recommended that the pumps be operated with servomotors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The characteristics of the foam can also be changed during the prototype production through an exact control of the mixing ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For example, the following operational parameters are possible: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> MDI (isocyanate) serves as component A and a polyol mixture with additives serves as component B. For example, the following formulation can be used:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The actual chemical reaction then occurs in the mixer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a potlife of approximately 10 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For one particularly advantageous embodiment, the arrangement comprises a measuring system, which controls the form of the already produced prototype part. Through feedback to the central computer, deviations from the desired value can thus be corrected during subsequent passages, for example by changing the mixing ratio for components A and B or by changing the speed of the application head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In most application cases, the outside dimensions of a prototype, produced exclusively with the above-described method, are not exact enough. In addition, a smooth, hard surface that can be lacquered is frequently required, which cannot be produced with the foaming method. For that reason, two methods are suggested for the finishing work on the prototype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With the first method (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the basic prototype is initially finished as undersized model (Figures a), b)). In a second step, a synthetic material that is generally a two-component plastic is deposited on the basic prototype with a second application head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As a rule, this second application head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> must operate with three linear and two rotational axes. Since it is probably difficult to deposit the synthetic material in such a way that an exact outside dimension results, it is recommended that the synthetic material be applied with excess dimensions and be cut down to the desired dimensions, following the curing of the synthetic material. A cutter head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> used for this can also be CNC controlled and generally must operate with 5 axes. All operations can conceivably be realized with the same overhead gantry, wherein only the operating heads are replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With a second method (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the basic prototype is first produced as oversized model. Subsequently, this basic prototype is cut down to the desired dimensions with a cutter head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. To obtain a hard surface, a two-component synthetic material is then deposited with a spraying head <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore suggested that an intermediate layer be inserted between the layers of the prototype, for example an aluminum sheet or a foil. Intermediate layers of this type can be smooth, perforated or perforated and interlaced&mdash;for example a rib mesh. Individual sheet metal sheets/foils of this type are placed onto the top layer following each &ldquo;passage&rdquo; of the application head. This can be done by hand or by means of a robot. Intermediate layers of this type have the advantage that they can absorb tensile forces and thus can stabilize the prototype. Whether and how many such intermediate layers are necessary or desirable depends among other things on the size of the prototype and the material selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A suitable application head is described in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A suitable mixing head is shown in the cross-sectional representation in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Mixer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in this case form a single structural. A mixing-chamber housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is open toward the bottom and thus forms the nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is positioned so as to be axially displaceable inside the mixing chamber housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The hydraulic piston <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> that is positioned inside the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> effects the axial displacement of the piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The hydraulic piston <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to the hydraulic rod <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, which caries the first ball bearing <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> on its lower end. The splined shaft <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is held on the inner raceway for the ball bearing <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, so that the hydraulic rod <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the splined shaft <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are axially coupled, but are not connected with respect to the rotation around axis A-A. The splined shaft <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> penetrates the coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As a result, the coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the splined shaft <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are connected for their rotational movement. The piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that is arranged inside the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is attached to the end of the splined shaft <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The above-mentioned coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is connected via the second ball bearing <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to the bearing flange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which in turn is rigidly flanged to the mixing chamber housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has an essentially symmetrical design with respect to the axis A-A and carries the gear rim <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> on the outside. The motor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can be used to drive the gear rim <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and thus also the coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The gear wheel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is arranged on the shaft of motor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, which in turn is connected by means of the toothed belt <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> to the gear rim <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is flanged via the console <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the lantern <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> or the bearing flange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The stirring rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, which extends parallel to axis A-A inside the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, is arranged on the coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and extends through the piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The two nozzles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are arranged inside the mixing chamber housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The viscous liquids to be mixed are pushed through these nozzles into the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The two nozzles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are shown only schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a design option for these nozzles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The mixing chamber housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is provided with two recesses <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, into which respectively one nozzle body <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is inserted (shown is only one nozzle body <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> herein). Inside of the nozzle body <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, the externally built-up high pressure (see above) is adjusted by means of an injection piston <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the liquid is pushed through the nozzle body opening <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> from the nozzle body <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Arrangements of this type are known in the technical field and will not be described further herein. The actual nozzle openings in this case are the exit bores <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B in the hardened nozzle tips <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C in mixing-chamber housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The nozzle bodies can also conceivably be extended up to the mixing chamber, so that the front of the nozzle body forms a component of the side wall of the mixing chamber. In that case, the nozzle-body opening and the exit bore in the nozzle tip would be identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The principal mode of operation for the mixer is described in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The first operating position of the device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In that case, the piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is located above the nozzle openings for nozzles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. In this position, the liquids to be mixed are injected through the nozzles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> into the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The injecting occurs normally under high pressure, meaning with injection pressures above 100 bar. During the injection operation, the coupling element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and thus also the piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the stirring rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are rotated with the aid of motor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Even highly viscous liquids can be mixed as a result of the rotation of piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the stirring rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The mixed-together liquids exit at the lower end of mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Following the completion of the mixing operation, the supply of the two liquids through the nozzles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is shut down. Subsequently, the piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is pushed axially downward inside the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) through pressure applied by the hydraulic piston <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The remaining residues are thus pushed out of the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the mixing chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is cleaned. At the same time, the stirring rod <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is scraped off and thus cleaned. If the production is to be restarted, then piston <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is pulled back to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the cycle can restart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The automatic cleaning function described herein ensures that the mixer/nozzle unit can be cleaned easily during each interruption in the production, for example for inserting an intermediate layer (see above), which is extremely important with quick-hardening PU foam, such as the one used for this example. </paragraph>
