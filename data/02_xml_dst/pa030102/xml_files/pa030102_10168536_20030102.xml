<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns a grating structure by high dispersion volume holography. It applies in particular in pulse compression or stretching devices, e.g. for the production of ultrashort or very high energy laser pulses. It also applies in the field of optical telecommunications, e.g. for wavelength division multiplexing devices or wave trap devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the fields of physics and chemistry, numerous analyses and many types of processing require the use of very short, high-energy laser pulses. For example, very powerful laser pulses are required in the field of plasma physics. Pulses with very high peak power are also useful in the field of machining materials, since they result in cleaner and more accurate contours, by reducing the heating of the materials machined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To date, the production of very high peak power laser pulses (Tera or Peta Watts) uses the CPA (Chirped Pulse Amplification) technique. This technique consists of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> stretching a low energy femtosecond pulse to make it nanosecond, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> amplifying its energy, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> compressing the high energy pulse obtained to make it femtosecond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> We therefore obtain an ultrashort, very high energy pulse, i.e. of very high peak power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, the pulse stretching and compression operations are carried out using diffraction gratings, according to an arrangement recommended by Treacy (IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol QE-5 No. 9, September, 1969 p. 454-458) of which a simplified diagram is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The arrangement represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for example a pulse compressor, comprises in particular two diffraction gratings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged parallel to each other. The first grating <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives at an angle of incidence &thgr; to the normal, an incident laser pulse F<highlight><subscript>IN </subscript></highlight>(represented with a single arrow) whose wavelength components are variable around a mean central wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. The diffracted beam is diffracted in turn by the second parallel grating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a beam parallel to the incident beam. This beam is reflected by reflecting means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the second grating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (beam indicated with a double arrow) and follows a return path identical to the outgoing path, forming, at the output of the first grating <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the output beam F<highlight><subscript>OUT</subscript></highlight>. The property of diffraction gratings to diffract the components with different wavelengths by a different angle depending on the wavelength is used. Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> represents the optical path for two components with wavelengths &lgr; (dotted line) and &lgr;&prime; (solid line), where &lgr;&prime; is greater than &lgr;. The optical path and therefore the travel time taken by the component at &lgr;&prime; is greater than that of the component at &lgr;, so that the pulse energy is concentrated in the output beam F<highlight><subscript>OUT </subscript></highlight>in a very short period for all wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The diffraction gratings used until now are engraved gratings, i.e. gratings with lines engraved on the surface at a regular pitch. However, they do not offer complete satisfaction. A disadvantage with engraved gratings is that their throughput, approximately 90%, only results in a low compression efficiency, approximately 65%. Another disadvantage of these engraved gratings is that they display poor resistance to the laser flow. For example, for a pulse of wavelength 1053 nm and a duration of 250 femtoseconds, the gold engraved gratings display a resistance to laser flow of less than 1 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Consequently, users equipped with installations producing considerable energy are unable, in practice, to fully benefit from all the power they would expect from an efficient compressor and/or stretcher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The main purpose of the invention is to overcome these disadvantages of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To achieve this, one objective of the invention is to supply a grating structure by volume holography with high dispersive power, such that, in particular, it can be introduced in a Treacy type arrangement and which in addition displays very good stretching or compression efficiency as well as better resistance to laser flow than the diffraction gratings of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More precisely, the invention concerns a grating structure by high dispersion volume holography, wherein it comprises a transmission volume holographic grating produced on a reflective support, the said grating consisting of strata inclined to the plane of the support, the angle of inclination of the strata defined with respect to the normal to the support and the pitch of the strata being chosen such that a light beam of given mean wavelength, incident on the said structure with a given angle of incidence, undergoes a first passage through the grating, is reflected by the reflective support, undergoes a second passage through the grating and is only diffracted by the grating during one of the said passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition to its applications in the field of pulse compression and/or stretching, the structure according to the invention is suitable for other applications due to its high dispersive power, especially in the field of optical telecommunications. In particular, the invention concerns a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) device and a wave trap device implementing the grating structure according to the invention.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the figures, the identical elements are indexed using the same references. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> represent two examples of realisation of grating structure by volume holography according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The grating structure according to the invention comprises in particular a transmission volume holographic grating produced on a reflective support. The volume grating is formed from a thick layer (a few dozen microns) of a holographic material in which strata of given pitch &Lgr; are inscribed, inclined with respect to the plane of the layer support at a given angle &phgr; defined with respect to the normal to the support. The angle of inclination &phgr; and the pitch of the strata &Lgr; are chosen such that a light beam of given mean central wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, incident on the said structure with a given angle of incidence &thgr;, undergoes a first passage through the grating, is reflected by the reflective support, undergoes a second passage through the grating and is only diffracted by the grating during one of the said passages. In practice, since the angle of incidence of the beam is given (preferably close to the Brewster angle to avoid reflections at the interface), the pitch of the strata is determined according to the mean central wavelength. The angle of inclination of the strata is chosen according to the type of reflective support used, to introduce a dissymmetry in the direction of beam propagation with respect to the direction of the strata during the first and second passages, which will result in diffraction during only one of the said passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Due to this type of structure, the diffracted beam emerges at an angle close to the angle of incidence &thgr;. The resulting grating structure therefore has high dispersive power, which means that it can be used in a Treacy type arrangement as described previously. The device obtained is then highly efficient. The efficiency of a volume grating, in fact, is above 98%, which means that a compression efficiency of approximately 92% can be obtained, i.e. a gain of some 40% as compared with engraved gratings. In addition, the holographic materials display good resistance to the laser flow, for example approximately 2 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 4 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for a pulse of wavelength 1053 nm and duration 250 femtoseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the grating structure according to the invention, instead of having a reflection grating acting in direct diffraction, a transmission volume grating is used according to the invention which, for example, allows the incident beam to pass without diffraction to the reflective support, and which then receives the reflected beam and diffracts it (with an angle of diffraction that depends on the wavelength. Direct diffraction is therefore replaced by a &ldquo;transmission without diffraction-reflection-transmission with diffraction&rdquo;, or &ldquo;transmission with diffraction-reflection-transmission without diffraction&rdquo; sequence, the transmission without diffraction and the transmission with diffraction being carried out by the same layer containing the transmission volume holographic grating. Apart from providing better resistance to the laser flow than the engraved gratings of the prior art, this structure offers the advantage for example compared with reflection holographic gratings, of being much easier to produce technologically. To obtain the same dispersion, in fact, the applicant has demonstrated that the pitch of the strata in a reflection grating should be smaller, and the angle of inclination of the strata large (a few dozen degrees), making the recording of the grating very difficult in practice, at the usual recording wavelengths in the traditional holographic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to a first mode of realisation of the invention, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the transmission volume grating is a grating with strata inclined to the plane of the support, but not perpendicular to it, produced on a reflective support which is, for example, a dielectric mirror or a holographic mirror with non inclined strata. The applicant has demonstrated that for a beam incident on the structure with an angle &thgr; of approximately 60.5&deg; to the normal and an angle of inclination of the strata to the normal to the support of approximately 2&deg;, the required result is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to a second mode of realisation of the invention, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the said transmission volume grating is firstly a grating with perpendicular strata and secondly the said reflective support is a holographic mirror with inclined strata. The applicant has demonstrated that in this example, for a beam incident on the structure with an angle &thgr; of approximately 60.5&deg;, as previously, and an angle of inclination of the strata of the reflection grating forming the reflective support to the normal to the support of approximately 89&deg;, the required result is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> We will now give a more detailed description of the examples of realisation illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> which show the components comprising grating structures according to the invention, adapted to pulse compression or stretching means, e.g. for a device used to generate ultrashort, very high energy pulses using a Treacy type arrangement. The structures described below are adapted for pulses generated by a Neodymium-doped YAG laser (mean central wavelength of approximately 1.053 &mgr;m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The components described operate for &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; (or transverse magnetic, TM) polarisation, such that the electric field is in the plane of incidence defined by the normal to the component and the wave vector of the incident wave. The angle of incidence is close to the Brewster angle, which reduces the reflection at the interface between the external medium and the structure. It is determined according to the desired application. In the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, an incident beam at an angle &thgr; of approximately 60.5&deg; to the normal to the support meets the constraints of the Treacy arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The component represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> comprises a support <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which could be made from glass, for example of type BK7. The support <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is coated with a mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> forming the reflective support. The mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is for example a multidielectric mirror. According to a mode of realisation of the invention, it may consist of a stack of pairs of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-HfO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers. For example, the external layer may be a layer of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. According to a variant, it may also be a reflection volume grating with non inclined strata (holographic mirror), adapted to the wavelength of the incident beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to this example, the mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is coated with a buffer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> resistant to the laser flow, itself covered with a thick layer (several dozen microns) of a holographic material <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which forms the transmission volume holographic grating. The buffer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may consist of a transparent material such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for example, preferably deposited using a sol-gel process. It has advantageously a refractive index similar to that of the holographic material <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and thickness such that, for the length of the laser pulse considered, the holographic grating so formed no longer causes interference between the incident wave and the reflective wave. The holographic material is for example dichromated gelatine, photopolymer, or material produced using a sol-gel process. Tests on the resistance to the laser flow with femtosecond pulses have in fact demonstrated good behaviour of the above-mentioned holographic materials (for example, 4 to 5 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for the dichromated gelatine and 2 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>with a photopolymer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the material <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> used is for example a photopolymer material inscribed with strata of pitch &Lgr; (a few hundred nanometres) inclined at angle &phgr; approximately 2&deg; to the normal to the support. Depending on the angle of incidence &agr; of the laser beam to these strata, the beam sees in its direction of propagation strata separated by a pitch &Lgr;/cos&agr;. There is a critical angle of incidence of the laser beam to the strata, for which the laser beam sees strata evenly distributed at a pitch equal to the wavelength (or multiple or sub-multiple of the wavelength). For this critical angle &agr;<highlight><subscript>cr </subscript></highlight>the grating is highly diffractive and reflects the beam at an angle which depends on the wavelength. As soon as we move away from this angle, even by 1 or 2&deg;, the grating is no longer diffractive and it is crossed without modification by the laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An anti-reflection layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be deposited at the interface between the external medium and the said volume holographic grating, especially when the incident beam is in perpendicular polarisation, in order to minimise the reflection losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> We will now give an example of numerical values for this mode of realisation. The thickness of the mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to 10 microns, the buffer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a thickness of 25 microns, the layer of holographic material <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a modulation of index 0.04 and a thickness of approximately 30 microns. The strata are inclined at an angle &phgr; of approximately 2&deg; to the normal to the support and the pitch of the strata is approximately 630 nm for the chosen mean wavelength (1.053 &mgr;m). The indices of the anti-reflection <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, buffer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> layers are approximately the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the mode of realisation illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the incident wave is successively subject to the following effects. It is transmitted through the interface between the air and the anti-reflection layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The reflection losses are minimised due to the state of the polarisation and the angle of incidence. It is then transmitted through the anti-reflection layer to the interface with the holographic layer, then through the holographic layer. The angle of incidence of the beam to the strata of the holographic layer grating is sufficiently different from the critical angle &agr;<highlight><subscript>cr </subscript></highlight>for the holographic layer to remain transparent to the beam. The difference is due to the angle &phgr; (angle of inclination of the grating strata); it is approximately 2&deg;. The incident wave then crosses the buffer layer, is reflected on the dielectric mirror and goes back through the buffer layer to the holographic grating of layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. On return, however, the angle of incidence on the strata is different. It is very close to the critical angle, resulting in very high diffraction by the holographic grating and modification of the output angle depending on the wavelength. The emerging beams are then transmitted through the holographic layer-air interface. The reflection losses are minimised due to the state of the polarisation and the angles of approximately 60&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Consequently, for an input beam incident at 60.5&deg;, the output beam leaves at an incidence of 51.9&deg; for the mean wavelength of 1053 nm, the output incidence varying with the wavelength. We can therefore produce, for example, a transmission grating whose characteristics are such that nearly 100% of the wave incident at 60.5&deg; is transmitted by the said grating, and nearly 100% of the wave previously transmitted then reflected by the said reflective support is diffracted by the said grating to leave on average at 51.9&deg;. Gratings with high diffraction efficiency and large size (diameter approximately 150 mm) have therefore been produced according to the invention on dielectric mirror. Obviously, according to the principle of inverse propagation of light, we can also work with a beam incident on the structure with an angle &thgr; of approximately 52&deg;. It will be diffracted the first time it passes through the holographic layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through an angle which depends on the wavelength. The beams so diffracted will be reflected by the mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, then transmitted without diffraction by the holographic grating <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to emerge from the structure with an angle of approximately 60&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> We will now describe, in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> second mode of realisation of a grating structure according to the invention for a Neodymium-doped YAG laser of mean wavelength 1053 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The component shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> comprises a support <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> covered with a holographic mirror <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with strata slightly inclined with respect to the layer (&phgr;<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&equals;89&deg; to the normal to the layer) and which forms the reflective support according to the invention. The holographic mirror in this example also disperses the wavelengths, but not significantly due to the slight inclination of the strata with respect to the support. A buffer layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, resistant to the laser flow, with characteristics similar to those described in the first mode of realisation, covers the holographic mirror <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A holographic material <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, of the same type as that described previously, is deposited on the layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to form the transmission volume holographic grating. In this example however, the strata are almost perpendicular to the layer (&phgr;&equals;0&deg;). The angle of incidence is almost equal to 60.5&deg;, and the diffracted angle is almost equal to 51.9&deg; for the mean wavelength 1053 nm. An anti-reflection layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this example, the dissymmetry during the first and second passages, in the direction of propagation of the beam compared with the direction of the strata on the transmission grating <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (angle of incidence &agr;), is obtained due to the inclination of the strata on the reflection volume holographic grating forming the reflective support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The examples shown are not exhaustive and this dissymmetry, whereby the beam is diffracted by the transmission grating only in one direction, can be obtained by other configurations using the transmission grating and the reflective support. The advantages of the examples described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> include the implementation of a thin multilayer structure, highly resistant to the flow, especially since there is no need to insert additional lamina, for example made from glass, which might not be able to withstand the very high energies, between the layers forming the transmission hologram and the reflective support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The components described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> apply in particular to pulse compression or stretching means and to a device which generates pulses of very high peak power including such compression and/or stretching means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Other applications are possible for the grating structure according to the invention, which make use of its high dispersive power and excellent efficiency. For example, in the field of optical telecommunications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic representation of a traditional arrangement in optical telecommunications for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). This arrangement comprises collimation optics <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a diffracting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The collimation optics <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> forms from a light beam of given mean wavelength output from an optical fibre <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> a parallel beam F<highlight><subscript>IN </subscript></highlight>on the diffracting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in order to separate the beam components (or channels) into the various wavelengths. On the diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, two components with wavelengths &lgr; and &lgr;&prime; are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The invention proposes a multiplexing device which implements the grating structure by volume holography according to the invention, forming the diffracting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. According to the invention, it consists of a transmission volume grating <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> produced on a reflective support <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Due to its high dispersive power, it is capable of resolving wavelengths separated by a few fractions of a nanometre (0.2 to 0.5 nm), which could be extremely useful, especially when it is necessary to work with numerous channels. The pitch of the strata of the transmission volume grating <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> is determined according to the mean central wavelength of the incident beam (for example around 1.5 &mgr;m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The invention also proposes a wave trap device for optical telecommunications, in order to separate a given wavelength from a packet of wavelengths. According to the invention, it comprises a grating structure by high dispersion volume holography as previously described. The characteristics of the structure are chosen so that the structure is adapted to the wavelength to be trapped, resulting in diffraction during only one of the passages in the transmission grating of the component of the incident beam at the said wavelength. The components at the other wavelengths are reflected without diffraction by the structure and therefore emerge from the structure in a direction different from the component which was diffracted, thereby separating them. </paragraph>
