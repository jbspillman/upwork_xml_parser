<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be described in the below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the overall configuration of a communications system according to the embodiment of present invention, and as shown in the diagram, a subscriber site <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an switching station <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are connected through a subscriber line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In the subscriber site <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a subscriber side transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a splitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and telephone terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, etc. are provided. In the switching station <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a switching system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a station side transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a splitter <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and a LAN (Local Area Network) <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and a host device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are provided. The subscriber site <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can a conventional house for residence or an office building of a company or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The subscriber side transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the station side transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> transmit and receive xDSL (digital sub-scriber line) signals. The other ends of the transmitter/receivers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are, for instance, equipped with Ethernet interfaces. Splitters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> split among telephone signals and xDSL signals. The telephone signals are exchanged between the telephone terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the switching system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The switching system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> transmits telephone signals to an other party telephone terminal through relay switching systems (not shown) and the like and receives the same from the other party telephone terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected to the LAN <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> through the subscribe side transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the subscriber side splitter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the station side splitter <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the station side transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As a result, the host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is placed in the network configured with LAN <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> etc. The host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is assigned with an address of the network (a private IP address or global IP address.) Of course, other network addressing systems can be adopted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The host device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> on the station side transmits a plurality of information streams with a broadcast address using a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol. Moreover, the information streams are assigned with respective destination port numbers. Those port numbers for example p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, p<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, p<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , are related to channel numbers for example ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, ch<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, ch<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . Those port numbers or channel numbers are used for identifying information providing programs. Each information stream can include at least one of still picture information, motion picture information, text information, and audio information, etc. The transfer rate can be adapted based on the content type of a steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The subscriber side host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> receives streams thus transferred in a broadcast manner in accordance with a the TCP/IP protocol. The host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can define the selection of enabled sockets for receiving streams at a communications interface (Ethernet NIC). A stream having a broadcast address and a corresponding port number p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, p<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, p<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or the like is sent to a corresponding socket and is subjected to packet discard or packet allowance based on the definition. Moreover, the allowed packets are sent to the application process which corresponds to the socket. The application process can be of a type which displays information in real time, or which prints out the information, or which stores information on an auxiliary storage device such as a hard disk, or of the like type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> At the subscriber side host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a graphical user interface such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> can be adopted for definition of channels (sockets). In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the channel ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is received in real time, and displayed in the first window. The channel ch<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also received in real time and outputted to the speaker. The channel ch<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also received and displayed in another window. The channel ch<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is recorded on a hard disk (it is not outputted in real time. But it can be outputted in real time in another mode.) The channels ch<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and ch<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are disabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A part or the whole of the setting information can be sent through a network or read out from a recording card to set the selections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also, the destination port numbers of the stream from the station side host device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can be changed time by time, and correspondingly the setting information at the subscriber side host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be modified. And, the setting information can be charged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, information can be provided to multiple subscribers through subscriber lines using a broadcast technique. Moreover, the broadcast streams or channels can be selected using a socket technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not confined with the details disclosed with the preferred embodiment, and various modification in form and detail can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For instance, wireless subscriber lines of a mobile telephone system can be used for transferring information in a broadcast manner in place of the conventional subscriber lines. Moreover, xDSL signals can be replaced with ISDN signals, etc. While the branch is placed in front of the subscriber switching system for connection to the transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the above description, the branch can be placed in front of a relay switching system. Also, streams to be sent can be originated from not the host device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in the network of the LAN <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> but a host device in another network. The Streams originated from the host device in the another network can be routed to the network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> by a router or gateway, and then sent to the subscriber side host device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by broadcast. In this case, the destination address is modified into a broadcast address by the gateway, or broadcast packets sent for a predetermined socket in the another network are sunk to the network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Also, an access server can be provided for receiving broadcast streams coming from the outside of the network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Of course, the streams coming from the outside of the network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the streams coming from the host device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can be used together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, a LAN <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of one switching station can be interconnected with one or more LAN <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of other one or more switching station <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> using leased lines or virtual private networks to form a large scale LAN, and then a host device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> for providing content information can be placed for the large scale LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Also, using the IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6), a multicast technique provides one to multiple points transfer in various manners. The conventional broadcast in a network can be achieved by the multicast in the ITv6. Moreover, information can be sent to a lot of addresses over plural networks, and information transmitted from one host can be transferred in a broadcast manner within each of the plural network (Of course, IPv6 routers etc. are necessary). In this invention, it is important that the same stream is transferred in a broadcast manner within one network, and both of the conventional broadcast technique and the multicast technique of the IPv6 can be utilized. </paragraph>
