<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is an apparatus and method for controlling the weight of fabric produced by a textile machine, in particular by a circular textile machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As is known, textile machines, and in particular circular knitting machines for manufacturing knitted fabrics, are generally provided with a pick-up unit for the produced fabric piece, said unit being equipped, beyond with suitable traction rolls, with a winding roll in case the piece is picked up in rolls, or with a cloth folder in case said piece is picked up in laps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the case of circular knitted machines the pick-up unit consists of a structure turning integrally with the cylinder or needle bed placed above it together with the stretching rolls positioned upstream from said pick-up unit. The rotary motion of the stretching and pick-up unit and of the needle bed usually consists of a mechanical unit or, in more recent times, said motion is driven by an electric motor enslaved in its turn with an electronic unit controlling the correct working of every portion of the textile machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since all the fabric pieces, either folded into rolls or piled up in laps, coming out of a knitting mill and successively sent to other departments or factories for finishing or dyeing operations must be assigned their effective weight, it is provided in the prior art to weigh each individual piece in a suitable weighing department. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In practice, some pieces produced by a given textile machine are piled up beside said machine and then periodically picked up and conveyed together with other groups of pieces coming from other machines to the weighing department, in which the weight of each piece is written down directly onto an edge of the fabric or on a card which should obviously be attached to the weighed piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the weight of each piece should then be written down onto a summary form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The weighing process briefly described above shows a number of disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> First of all, pieces have weights which can strongly vary with respect to the foreseen values, since the evaluation of the weight of a given piece during its production is generally carried out on the basis of the number of revolutions made by the knitting machine during its manufacture. According to the moisture degree, to the kind of yarn and to the knitted structure, highly different weights having the same number of revolutions and sometimes even going beyond the admissible tolerance field can correspond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, technical times directly required for the detection of the weight of fabric pieces and times required for their conveyance to the weighing departments are quite long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The specific personnel is therefore partially diverted from carrying out more specifically manufacturing operations connected with the working of textile machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It should be observed that the conveyance and storing in the same place of several pieces coming from different machines can easily involve an exchange between similar pieces assigning to them features, such as the kind of yarn and the batch of raw materials used, which do not correspond to the actual features, thus clearly creating problems in the handling of the produced fabrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It should eventually be pointed out that the practice to put an indelible mark directly onto an edge of the fabric, which cannot therefore be used, can involve high economic losses in the case of valuable textile fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In this situation the technical purpose of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for controlling the weight of fabric produced by a textile machine which can substantially overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Within said technical purpose an important aim of the invention is to provide an apparatus and a method allowing to obtain at the output of the textile machines wound or folded fabric pieces showing&mdash;with an extremely reduced tolerance field&mdash;a pre-established weight, independently from the kind of yarn, and therefore to reach for Instance high degrees of homogeneity of the unfinished products which should then undergo finishing or dyeing operations. Another important aim of the invention is to provide an apparatus and a method allowing to assign with certainty to every piece of manufactured fabric not only its actual weight, but also every other information which could be useful to distinguish it, such as the kind of yarn, the presence of possible defects due to machine stops, and the moisture degree at which the fabric-building process took place, thus avoiding information exchanges among the various fabric pieces due to operators&apos; faults or other reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A further aim is to provide an apparatus and a method showing the weight of a given fabric piece immediately at the end of its manufacturing process, thus eliminating dead times required in the prior art because of the weighing operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The technical purpose and the aims indicates are substantially reached by means of an apparatus and a method for controlling the weight of fabric produced by a textile machine, characterized in that they comprise one or more technical solutions claimed below.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures mentioned above, the apparatus for controlling the weight according to the invention is generally indicated with the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Said apparatus is installed on a textile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and in particular on a circular knitting machine, comprising a fixed structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> under which at least one needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turnably mounted around a vertical axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, said needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> consisting for instance of a cylinder and/or dial turning around stationary cans or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for the fabric piece is placed under the needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, said group being equipped with a winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in case the piece is wound into rolls, or with a cloth folder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The fabric piece is dragged towards the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by at least a traction roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can turn around the vertical axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> integrally with the needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to which it is connected by means of arms <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and it comprises a pair of pillars <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> laterally placed, joined in their lower portions by a pair of parallel bars <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defining their base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In an original way the apparatus for weight control <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises weighing means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>) adapted to weigh every single fabric piece and directly associated with the textile machine for the manufacture of said piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The weighing means comprise in their turn a weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for instance a load cell, adapted to continuously detect the weight reached by said piece during its manufacturing process and when wound in rolls or laps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to an electronic control group <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), for instance a PLC, which can check the overall working of the textile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and in particular of a main electric motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> controlling the rotation of the needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The electronic control group <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is advantageously connected, or at least put into communication, with a printer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> producing self-adhesive labels containing at least the information referring to the weight measured by the weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a display <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> showing the operator the progression of the measured-weight may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to a first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the weighing means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprise, beyond the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a support unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed by a vertically sliding portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and by a fixed base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defining a guide for said sliding portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The latter supports the pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and shows a portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>operatively contacted with a flexible wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is integral in its lower portion with a base plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> connected in its turn with the fixed structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus, introducing suitable joints into the arms <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connecting the needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in order to avoid that the weight of the needle bed is transmitted onto said group, the weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> detects a load including the weight of said pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which represents the tare, and the weight of the fabric wound onto the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The vertically sliding portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprises a support base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected with the pick-up unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and therefore turning integrally with said unit and with the cylinder or needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> slidably connected in vertical direction with the fixed base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and turning coupling means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> placed between a vertical support shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, constituting a lower extension of the support base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and said slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The turning coupling means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> consist of rolling-contact bearings supporting the axial load undergone by the vertical shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> More to the point, the slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is defined by a substantially glass-shaped cylindrical element housing the vertical shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and turning coupling means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and showing a bottom wall defining said portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>operatively contacted with the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The fixed base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises a substantially bush-shaped element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, integral with ledges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the fixed structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and slidably coupled with the slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the central axis of said slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and therefore the axis of the vertical shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> coincide with the vertical axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cylinder or needle bed <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Between the fixed base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> anti-turning means <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are provided, said means including a threaded plug <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> introduced into a radial hole of the fixed base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and showing a head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>housed in a vertical groove <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shows on its outer side a ring-shaped abutment extension <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>abutting against an upper edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bush-shaped element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to define a lower run end for the vertical translation of the slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The abutment extension <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is normally detached of some millimeters from said upper edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so as to allow the slide <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to unload its weight onto the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned support base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a circular plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> integral in its lower portion with the vertical shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a pair of elongated elements <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> peripherally welded to the circular plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Said elongated elements <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are connected with the parallel bars <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defining the base of the pick-up-unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the apparatus for the weight control <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed along the pair of pillars <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, below the end supports of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or of the cloth folder. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each pillar <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is divided into two portions, an upper portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lower portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The end supports of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are mounted onto the upper portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in the same way as the traction rolls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The lower portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is integral in its lower part with the pair of parallel bars <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and it is connected in its upper part to the arms <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by means of a support <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the weighing means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the apparatus for weight control <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are placed as a connection of each upper portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the corresponding lower portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this case two weight sensors or load cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are preferably provided, said sensors or cells being operatively mounted between said portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to enable weight measurement of the first portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, of the traction rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and of the picked up piece. Each load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> carries out an independent weight measurement. Weight can therefore be detected by only one load cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixed in its lower portion with an upper end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the lower portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, for instance by means of at least a first screw <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> engaged into at least a first through hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the upper end, and into at least a first blind hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In its upper portion the cell shows a flexible wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>integral with a lower end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the upper portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for instance by means of at least a first screw <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> engaged into at least a second through hole <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the lower end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and into at least a second blind hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the load cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is also provided for a support element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, consisting for instance of a support bolt engaged into a third hole <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the upper end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the lower portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Said support is not usually in contact with the lower end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, but it supports the upper portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the load to be measured is over a certain safety value beyond which the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be damaged. The support <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> acts in practice as a run end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the apparatus for weight control <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed in a protruding position outside the machine, by means of a pair of support arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending from the pair of pillars <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> respectively. Both support arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> house the weighing means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, advantageously carried out by means of load cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The end supports <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or of the cloth folding rest on both load cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so as to allow said cells to detect only the weight of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, of the supports and of the fabric piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, it could be provided for. suitable support elements <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, analogous to those described in the second embodiment, in order to protect such load cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>, the machine is advantageously provided with three traction rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, preferably located on the same horizontal plane as the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, between which the fabric piece is introduced before reaching the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The vertical pulling strength determined by the fabric piece during its manufacturing stage is thus unloaded onto the traction rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. It can thus be avoided that said pulling strength is transmitted to the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which would affect the weight detected by the load cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Moreover, at least one of sand winding rolls <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or traction rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be provided with two circumferential grooves <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> carried out on the outer edges of the folded fabric piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the central traction roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, i.e. the one absorbing the pulling strength of the piece, is provided with grooves <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on its ends and on the outer edges of the folded fabric piece. These grooves allow to avoid the formation of a permanent fold in the folded tubular fabrics on their edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The working of an apparatus according to the invention, which has been described above mainly from the structural point of view, is the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the first case the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> continuously detects the weight it supports by means of the sliding portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the support unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the second case. the cell directly detects the weight of one of the upper portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pair of pillars <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In the third and preferred form of embodiment the load cell directly detects only the weight of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, of the end supports <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and of the piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In all the embodiments shown the detected weight increases with the piling up of the fabric piece on the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The value of such weight is transmitted from the load cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the PLC <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by means of a signal constituted by an electric voltage. This voltage is compared within the PLC with a preset reference voltage, corresponding in practice to the desired weight the fabric piece should have after manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the measured weight reaches a threshold value, the display shows the operator the weight progression so as to simplify its control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the voltage coming from the weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> gets near the value of said reference voltage, the PLC sets the procedure required to stop the textile machine so that the latter stops production exactly on reaching the pre-established weight by the fabric piece formed. It is now possible to carry out a new more precise weight measurement with the machine in a still status and possibly to provide a further advancement of said piece until the desired value is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The detected weight and any other information sent to the PLC by the sensors of the machine and/or set by the operator, such as moisture, the kind of yarn used, possible interruptions of production corresponding to manufacturing defects, are immediately written down on adhesive cards issued by the printer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Obviously, the calculation and setting of the desired fabric eight should consider the tare, constituted by the weight of all the parts resting on the weighing device, from which&mdash;though only in the first two embodiments&mdash;the weight corresponding to the pulling strength exerted by the needle bed onto the piece should be subtracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It is obviously possible to provide for other embodiments of the present invention. For instance, the weight sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be located in such a position as to detect loads exerted onto the connecting arms <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thus weighing a hanging load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention can advantageously and similarly be applied also to a loom <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> or any other textile machine for which it could be useful to weigh the yarn or fabric produced in the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> fabric piece <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is produced with the loom <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, said piece being wound around a winding roll <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> supported on its end supports <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> by a pair of support arms <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Also in this case load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> implementing an apparatus for controlling the piece weight are placed between the support arms <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the end supports <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the winding roll <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The invention implements a new method which is also an integral part of the present patent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Said method consists in weighing each folded or wound fabric piece near the textile machine manufacturing said piece after the latter has been produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The method further provides to associate each produced piece with a printed element providing at least the information concerning the weight assigned to said piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the weighing of each piece produced by a textile machine is carried out continuously, at least during the final manufacturing stage, so as to compare the detected weight, increasing during manufacturing and pick-up of said piece, with a pre-established reference weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is preferably provided for a display located near the machine, which shows the progression of the weight when it reaches a first reference value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The textile machine is stopped when the detected weight reaches said pre-established value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Since during the working of the machine the weight measurement is slightly different from the measurement with the machine in a still status, in order to get a more precise measurement it is advantageously possible to provide a first machine stop on reaching a pre-established weight value near the desired one. After said measurement is carried out the machine is re-started until the desired weight, which can be further checked with the machine in a still status, is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The invention has important advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> First of all, the weight of each piece corresponds with a high degree of precision to the pre-established weight, since the latter and no other parameters defines the end of the manufacturing and folding or winding stages of said piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that the cards identifying each piece according to its weight and other parameters deemed as necessary to distinguish it are immediately available at the end of its manufacturing and can therefore be applied onto said piece, thus avoiding mistakes and information exchanges among different pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It should further be pointed out that the continuous weighing of each piece during its manufacturing can be used for a remote monitoring of production for several textile machines, so as to know exactly in real time the quantity and kind of produced material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Moreover, said information, suitably processed, can be used for storehouse control and for the related certification forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Other important advantages can be obtained, in particular, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> First of all, as a matter of fact, a great improvement in weighing precision and reliability can be pointed out, due to tare reduction, the tare consisting only of the winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and of its supports, and to the elimination of the vertical pulling strength of the piece which had to be subtracted from the tare weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the preferred embodiment of the invention simplifies the process of removal of the loaded winding roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and its replacement with another roll, thus simplifying the operator&apos;s intervention and making it possible to place a pick-up trolley directly under the roll and possibly to automate said operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present embodiment is a reduction of permanent folds on the edges of tubular fabric, since thanks to suitable grooves <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made on the traction rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the usual flattening of said edges can be avoided. A final advantage of the preferred embodiment is the possibility to obtain machines with reduced height, thanks to the fact that the winding roll and the traction rolls are on the same horizontal plane instead of being on the same vertical plane. This greatly simplifies the visual check of the process carried out in the machine by the operator, since the introduction of the yarns into the cylinder is executed at such a height as to be visually accessible also to short people. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In practice, the weighing apparatus according to the invention allows to improve the handling of products of textile machines from an operational and organizational point of view, thus simplifying the various operating stages and reducing execution times. </paragraph>
