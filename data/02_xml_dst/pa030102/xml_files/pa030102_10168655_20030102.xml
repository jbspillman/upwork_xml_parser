<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a radio telecommunication apparatus provided with a cellular system radio device and a receiver for a radio calling system, and a radio telecommunication system and telecommunication apparatus using that radio telecommunication apparatus. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In mobile telecommunications, a radio calling system (paging system, Pocket-Beeper) capable of sending short text messages covers the greatest area. The radio calling system may service large areas, such as regional services generally on the prefectural and city levels, wide area services, and multi-area services. Normally one radio calling central station and a plurality of radio calling base stations are established in the service area of a radio calling system. When a caller dials the calling number of a radio calling receiver (pager receiver), the caller connected to the radio calling apparatus in the radio calling central station. The radio calling apparatus sends the address signal identifying the corresponding pager receiver and the input message signal to each radio calling base station. The signal sent to each radio calling base station is converted to a radio signal and sent simultaneously from the station on one radio frequency. If a pager receiver finds its own address signal in the received selection calling signal, the receiver rings, decodes the message signal, and displays the contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, intermittent receiving is generally adopted in order to reduce power consumption by the pager receiver. Consequently, existing radio calling utilize the of intermittent receiving to a considerable extent and the pager receiver has very low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in such a radio calling system, it is necessary for the user to register his or her location because the pager receiver cannot send any data or messages. When the user is moving into a new area, he or she uses a telephone, calls a registration number, and inputs his or her own calling number and the number of the new area to which the user wants to go. The information on the area to which message are to be transferred is thereby stored in the central station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, cellular systems are expanding at a very high speed. The basic signaling function of the portable telephones (portable terminals) in the cellular systems will be explained with reference to the flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the portable terminal is powered on in Step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, location registration <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is performed. The location of the portable terminal is registered on the network system in order to make it possible for the network system to give notification of incoming calls, no matter where the portable terminal is. When the location (area) information broadcasted through the broadcast control channel changes, the portable terminal automatically performs location registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> After location registration <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the portable terminal changes to a standby state <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In a cellular system, it becomes possible for the portable terminal to have intermittent reception with the provision of a paging channel (PCH or broadcast calling channel). In this standby state <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the portable terminal synchronizes with each of the associated broadcast calling channels and performs intermittent reception. When the broadcast calling channel is not being received, the power is not supplied to the radio portion of the portable terminal and power consumption can be made very low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When the send button or the like is operated and a call is initiated, the terminal enters the calling state <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The portable terminal sends a call signal to a base station, receives a communication channel allocation, transitions to the communicating state <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and performs communication. Upon receiving an incoming call signal through the broadcast calling channel, the terminal enters the incoming call state <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, responds to the call, changes to the indicated voice channel, and transitions to a talking state <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Also, in the case of crossing a cell boundary during a call, channel switching <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is performed. When the call ends, the disconnection procedure <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is performed, and the terminal returns to the standby state <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the third generation mobile communications system (IMT-2000), a global standard communications system will integrate low-speed communications such as pagers (Pocket-Beeper) to high-speed image communications such as video-on-demand services. In such an era of multimedia telecommunication, high-speed data communications will become possible and therefore various uses of portable telephones are being considered, such as installation of portable telephones as modems in various types of household electronics products or information terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Conventional portable terminals (portable telephones) operate as discussed above. However, in the standby state <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the terminals must receive paging information from base stations. In order to demodulate the paging information, additional time is required to stabilize the reception circuit separately from the time period used for signal reception. The power consumption during the standby of portable terminals in this cellular system becomes much greater than that of the radio calling system receivers. Further increases to the functions of portable terminals are being considered, but there are limitations to battery capacity and the possible standby time would then become even shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also, in next generation portable telephone systems with which multimedia communications is possible, a problem is that the system capacity drops when location registration is performed by each terminal, which is in the standby mode like the portable telephones discussed above. Specifically, when established location registration areas are too small, the data traffic for location registration expands and puts pressure on the control capacity on the base station side. Also, normally the location registration request signal is a random access signal and therefore, when location registration operations occur frequently, the transmission efficiency of the control channel drops rapidly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a radio telecommunication apparatus which can reduce power consumption during the standby mode of the portable terminal, and a radio telecommunication system and telecommunication apparatus using such radio telecommunication apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, it is another object to provide a radio telecommunication system which can prevent a drop in system capacity resulting from location registration or the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The best mode for carrying out the radio telecommunication apparatus according to the present invention is explained with reference to the schematic drawing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the block diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the radio telecommunication apparatus (portable terminal) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention comprises a radio calling system receiver (pager receiver) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a cellular system radio device (cellular radio device) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for controlling the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a whole and controlling on and off of the power to the pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The apparatus is constituted so that the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be powered on in response to a signal sent through the radio calling system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The wireless telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is explained in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A signal from the radio calling base station received with the antenna <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is amplified with a high frequency amplifier <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and is then split in two and input to the frequency converting portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. To each of the frequency converting portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a locally generated signal of a frequency equal to the carrier signal frequency from the oscillator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with a 90 degree phase difference is provided through the phrase shifter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The output converted to base band from each of the frequency converting portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then input to the demodulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through filters <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and limiters <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> respectively, and then demodulated. This demodulated signal is provided to the reception signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the message signal thereof is decoded when its own address signal is detected. The decoded message signal is provided to the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and displayed on the display <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the case where it is a normal reception message in the paging system. Also, when this is a message giving instructions to turn on the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, power is turned on to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the cellular radio device power control portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this case, a direct conversion system as discussed above is used for the pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but a super heterodyne system may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a signal from the cellular base station received with the antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is input to the receiving portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through the antenna splitter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then, high frequency amplification with the high frequency amplifier <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, this signal undergoes frequency conversion with the locally generated signal from the frequency synthesizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the reception mixer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and is demodulated by the demodulator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> through the intermediate frequency amplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A demodulated reception signal for itself undergoes signal processing by the reception signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the processing portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and is output to the receiver <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, or is output to the display <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> through the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a voice signal from the transmitter <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or input data from the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> undergoes signal processing in the sending signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and is then input to the sending portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In other words, the output signal of the sending signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> undergoes prescribed modulation processing in the modulator <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and then is converted to a high frequency signal with the sending mixer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to which is provided a signal from the high frequency synthesizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The converted high frequency signal is power amplified with the sending power amplifier <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and is then sent through the antenna splitter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the cellular base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes the following: a main central processing unit (main CPU) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for performing control of the entire radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; ROM <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> storing control programs, prescribed constants, and so forth; RAM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> used as the work area; Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM) <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> such as flash memory storing various parameters and tables; an operating portion CPU <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> connected to input keys <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and performing data input from the input keys <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and data output to the display <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; a pager receiver power control portion <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> controlling on and off of the power to the pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; and a cellular radio device power control portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> controlling on and off of of the power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. These various constitutional elements, the reception signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for the pager receiver, as well as the base band signal processing portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the cellular radio device are connected together with a bus <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> carries out control such as control of the sending and receiving sequence operations in the pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and control of the modulation and demodulation of the sending and receiving control signal and control of sending and receiving protocols. In addition, as discussed above, the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> performs control of the following: processing to display received messages of the paging system and information received with the cellular radio device, or various types of information for the operator with the display <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; processing to output data input from the input keys <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to the base band signal processing portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the cellular radio device; processing for the pager receiver power control portion <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the cellular radio device power control portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; processing to power on the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the cellular radio device power control portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> when a message is received instructing supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; and control of all other operations of the radio telecommunication apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A correspondence table between the areas in the paging system and every cell in the cellular system (or location registration areas) is stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or the EEPROM <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this way, the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention comprises a pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and power control portion (<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>) controlling on and off of power thereto; and is able to turn on the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in response to a message sent through the paging system. Consequently, as discussed below, it becomes possible to perform the standby operation using only the pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, having very low power consumption, and to turn on the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as necessary; and it becomes possible to reduce power consumption greatly during standby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A radio telecommunication system, relating to the present invention and including this type of radio telecommunication apparatus relating to the present invention, will be explained next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a drawing showing a schematic of the entire radio telecommunication system relating to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the radio telecommunication apparatus (portable terminal) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the present invention contains a pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A radio calling central station <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, having the function of a central station of the radio calling system (paging system), and a cellular system control station portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, having the function of the control station in a cellular system, are both established in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and connected to the public network. The radio calling central station portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to the radio calling base station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the cellular system control station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the cellular base stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also, a correspondence table for the telephone numbers of the pager receivers (pager receiver number) and those of the cellular radio devices (cellular radio device number), installed in the portable terminals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is prepared in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, along with a correspondence table of the paging system service areas and every the cellular system cell (or location registration areas). Moreover, in this drawing, only one radio calling base station is shown for brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The operation of the radio telecommunication system and radio telecommunication apparatus constituted in this way is explained with reference to the operating state transition drawing of the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the operation flowchart for the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when there is an incoming call to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the operation of the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is started, power is turned on to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>), and then location registration to the cellular system is performed (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). It is then determined whether there is a call to the cellular radio device through the paging system (<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>). Immediately after power is turned on, the result of this determination is NO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Next it is determined whether the current location is within a service area of the paging system (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). The determination is made by referencing the correspondence table for the areas of the paging system and the cells of the cellular system stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or the EEPROM <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the result of this determination is that the current location is not within any service area of the paging system, the terminal transitions to the cellular system standby state (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>). The same type of signaling function as the normal cellular system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is executed. Specifically, the terminal switches to a communicating state (<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>) due to making a call (<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>) or receiving a call (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>), and switches channels (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) upon moving between cells, or the like. At the end of communication (<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>), the process returns to the determination of whether the current location is within a service area of the paging system (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the case where the current location is within a service area of the paging system, the area registration to the paging system is performed (<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>). This area registration is made through the cellular system by means of the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provides the area registration signal for the radio calling central station portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the base band signal processing portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and sends this signal via the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The area registration signal, received by the cellular base station and sent to the cellular system control station portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is notified from the cellular control station portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the radio calling central station portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this way, the area registration to the paging system is performed automatically through the cellular system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the area registration signal is sent from the portable terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the central station of the paging system and the area registration is performed. However, the area registration may also be performed automatically in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, using the correspondence table of the paging system areas and the cellular system cells stored in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Specifically, when location registration (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) to the cellular system is performed, the correspondence table of the areas and cells, and the correspondence table of the cellular radio device numbers and pager receiver numbers are referenced and the pager receiver number is automatically registered to the area corresponding to the cell for which location registration (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) was performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, power is turned on to the pager receiver (<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) by the pager receiver power control portion <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and power is turned off (<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>) to the cellular radio device by the cellular radio device power control portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The terminal is then in the paging system standby state (<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When a call comes through the paging system in this standby state (<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>), the type of call (type of message) is determined (<highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>). When the call is a normal call from the paging service, normal paging service reception is performed (<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>). After reception ends (<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>), the terminal switches to the paging system standby state (<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>). Meanwhile, when the call is a call to the cellular radio device (request for incoming call to cellular radio device, message giving instructions to power on the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), the cellular radio device is powered on (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) and performs location registration (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). When the call is a call to the cellular radio device (<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>), the terminal switches to cellular system standby (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>), receives the broadcast calling channel and receives the call signal for itself (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>), and sends a response signal to the call, and then the terminal communicates on the designated communication channel (<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>). As necessary, channel switching (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) is performed and at the end of the communication (<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>), the process returns to the determination (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) of whether the current location is in the paging system service area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the case of an incoming call to the cellular radio device (<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>), it is determined in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whether this cellular radio device has finished the area registration to the paging system (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>). As discussed above, the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is adopted so as to automatically perform the area registration with respect to the service area through the cellular system when located within the paging system service area. In the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the correspondence table for pager receiver numbers and cellular radio device numbers is referenced, and the pager receiver number corresponding to the cellular radio device for which there is an incoming call is learned. In the radio calling central station portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether that pager receiver has finished the area registration with the paging system. As a result, when the pager receiver having the number corresponding to the cellular radio device member for which there is an incoming call has not undergone the area registration with the paging system, a call is made to the cellular system (<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>), like for the normal cellular system. In this case, the subsequent operations become the same as for the normal cellular system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, if the device has finished the area registration, the incoming call signal for the cellular radio device is converted to a paging system signal (<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>) (address signal for the corresponding pager receiver and message instructing supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and a call is made through the paging system. Specifically, the radio calling central station portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sends information indicating that there is an incoming call to the cellular radio device (or a message instructing supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>) to the pager receiver, corresponding to the cellular radio device for which there is an incoming call, through the paging base station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the portable terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thereby powered on, the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> performs an initial cell search and location registration, and initiates broadcast calling channel reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, the cellular control station portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> performs calling of the cellular radio device through the broadcast calling channel of the cellular system as well (<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> thereby receives the broadcast calling channel, receives the incoming call signal to itself, and allows to perform communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The operation of the control station in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> simply turns on the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when calling the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the paging system. An embodiment will now be explained which necessary paging information for the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, other than the message, is sent through the paging system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the flow of operations of the control station in the present embodiment; and the same numerals are used for processes which are essentially the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when there is an incoming call to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>), it is determined in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whether that cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has undergone area registration to the paging system (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>). When it has not been registered, processing is the same as in the case of an incoming call to a normal cellular system (<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>); when it is registered, the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is called through the paging system (<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Up to this point, the present embodiment is the same as the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> above. In this embodiment, however, paging information necessary for a cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sent as a message on the paging system (<highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>) after a message instructing supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sent and the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is called (<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>). This paging information is sent from the reception signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the paging receiver pager receiver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the control portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it becomes unnecessary to receive the broadcast calling channel with the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and furthermore, it becomes possible to narrow the range for the initial cell search by the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by referencing the correspondence table of the paging system area and cellular system cells, and a high-speed cell search becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> After the paging information necessary for the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sent through the cellular system in the step <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, the cellular control station portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> waits to receive a response signal from the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>), and changes to a communication channel and communicates on the cellular system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this way, in the radio telecommunication system according to the present invention, the terminal performs the area registration for the paging system, after being turned on, when located within the service area of the paging system, and then power to the cellular radio device is disconnected. Only the pager receiver is caused to operate and paging system standby thereby substitutes for the cellular system standby operation. Consequently, power consumption during standby of the radio telecommunication terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to reduce the frequency of location registration to the cellular system and the efficiency of the system can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it becomes possible to perform the area registration with the paging system automatically through the cellular system and the necessity for area registration with the paging system by the user can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, moreover, an incoming call to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is signaled by sending a message instructing the supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the paging system, but is not limited to this. It is also possible to establish a command or a prescribed code signaling an incoming call and to use this to signal an incoming call to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Also, as discussed above, the pager receiver is powered on after area registration to the paging system (Step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and subsequently the pager receiver remains powered on. However, either one may be caused not to operate in order to avoid noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as discussed above, when there is an incoming call to the cellular radio device and the call comes through the paging system, the fact that there is an incoming communication may also be displayed on the display <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the case where the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> cannot engage in communication because of the lack of an open channel or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the radio telecommunication system, processing is necessary in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Another embodiment of the present invention, which processing in the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not necessary and the operations can be done by the terminal user independently, is explained here. In this case, a control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> wherein are established the radio calling central station portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the cellular system control station portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are established as above becomes unnecessary, and the embodiment can be applied to existing radio calling systems and cellular systems. However, the telecommunication apparatus (telephone or portable telephone) includes telephone book information recording the cellular radio device numbers, information indicating whether the cellular radio device is a radio telecommunication apparatus relating to the present invention and includes a pager receiver, and the corresponding pager receiver numbers. The telecommunication apparatus also includes a function for sending to the pager a message instructing supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the present invention. Moreover, this telecommunication apparatus may naturally be the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a drawing showing an example of the format of one record in the telephone book information. As shown in this drawing, the numbers for the cellular radio devices (cellular telephone numbers), a flag F showing whether a pager receiver is present, and the numbers for corresponding pager receivers (pager telephone number) are stored for each name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Also, the operation of the radio telecommunication device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the present embodiment may be the same as in the status transitional drawing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> above. Moreover, area registration to the paging system by the control station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the operation when originating a call to the cellular radio device in the telecommunication apparatus relating to the present invention and constituted in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The telephone number to be called is input by selection from the telephone book information stored in the telecommunication apparatus or by direct input of the cellular telephone number (<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>), and a call is originated to that cellular radio device (<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>). As a result, when a message is received to the effect that the cellular phone is out of range or turned off, the call to the cellular radio device is stopped (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>). Meanwhile, when such a message is not received, communication is performed normally (<highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> After the end of the call to the cellular radio device in the step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the telephone book information is referenced and it is determined whether that cellular telephone number is the telephone number of a radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the present invention and including a pager receiver (<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>). As a result, the process ends without further action (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) when this is a telephone number for a portable terminal which does not include a pager receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a corresponding pager telephone number is stored, a message instructing the supply of power to the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> discussed above is sent to that pager telephone number (<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>). As explained in relation to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is thereby powered on and the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> enters the standby state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> After waiting for a prescribed period of time corresponding to the time from the instruction to power on the other party&apos;s cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> until that cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> enters the standby state (<highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>), a telecommunication apparatus then makes a call once more to that cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, even when the cellular radio device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the present invention is not powered on, it becomes possible to communicate therewith. Moreover, when the radio telecommunication apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is located out of range, the process is caused to end when these steps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> have been repeated a prescribed number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the case where the telecommunication apparatus relating to the present invention is used in this way, it becomes possible to reduce power consumption during standby of the portable terminal without the installation of special control stations such as in the radio telecommunication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the telephone book information is not limited to the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and the numbers of the cellular radio devices and the numbers of the corresponding pager receivers are at least recorded therein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Industrial Applicability </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the radio telecommunication apparatus, radio telecommunication system, and telecommunication apparatus relating to the present invention substitute paging system standby, with a pager receiver installed in the radio telecommunication apparatus, for cellular system standby. This thereby makes possible a great reduction to power consumption during standby of the radio telecommunication apparatus. The standby time can also be greatly extended beyond that of a normal cellular radio device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Because of including both a cellular radio device and a pager receiver, the apparatus relating to the present invention can be used as a regular cellular radio receiver and can also receive the various services of a paging system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because of being in standby on the pager system, the apparatus relating to the present invention does not perform transmission during standby, whereby traffic on the system as a whole becomes low and the system capacity increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the paging system area is wide, the number of times that location registration should be performed as a result of moving among the zones of the cellular system becomes very small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, while area registration on a conventional paging system should be performed by the user, it becomes possible with the present invention for area registration to be performed automatically through the cellular system. </paragraph>
