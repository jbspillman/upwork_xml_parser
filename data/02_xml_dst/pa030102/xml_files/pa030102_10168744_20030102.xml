<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a method of kinetic resolution of racemates of alcohols or carboxylic acid esters. Fluorine phase marking of the quicker or more slowly reacting enantiomer is obtained by lipase-catalysed reaction of racemic alcohols with fluorinated carboxylic acid esters of racemic alcohols with water. The enantiomers are then extractively separated by division between an organic and a fluorine phase. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for kinetic resolution of racemates of alcohols or carboxylic acid esters with one or several stereogenic centers. The invention is suitable in particular in the manufacture of pharmaceutical agents or plant protective agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemates of alcohols by enantiomer-selective esterification or by enantiomer-selective hydrolysis of carboxylic acid esters of racemic alcohols is a well-established method in organic synthesis (F. Theil, <highlight><italic>Chem. Rev. </italic></highlight>1995, 95, 2203-2227; U. T. Bornscheuer, R. J. Kazlauskas, <highlight><italic>Hydrolases in Organic Synthesis, </italic></highlight>Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1999). The slower-reacting enantiomer is retained as an alcohol or carboxylic acid ester while the faster reacting enantiomer is obtained as carboxylic acid ester or alcohol. Conventionally, alcohol and carboxylic acid ester are separated by chromatography (F. Theil et al., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem. </italic></highlight>1994, 59, 388-393). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Simpler separations are obtained only when, for example, alcohol and ester differ with regard to their solubility properties to such an extent that an extractive separation between aqueous and organic phase is possible, a method which can be realized however only in exceptional situations (P. Stead et al., <highlight><italic>Tetrahedron: Asymmetry </italic></highlight>1996, 7, 2247-2250). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A further possibility for the separation of ester and alcohol is provided when the formed ester is acidic, which can be realized, for example, by esterification with cyclic carboxylic acid anhydrides. However, this is also not a generally applicable method because cyclic anhydrides do not constitute optimal acyl donors for lipase-catalyzed esterifications. Moreover, acidic compounds reduce the lipase activity (B. Berger et al. Tetrahedron: <highlight><italic>Asymmetry </italic></highlight>1990 1, 541-546; U. T. Bornscheuer, R. J. Kazlauskas, <highlight><italic>Hydrolases in Organic Synthesis, </italic></highlight>Wiley-VCH, pp. 44-47, Weinheim, 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Racemic carboxylic acid esters with one or several stereogenic centers in the carboxyl group of the molecule can be esterified by lipase-catalyzed alcoholysis with an alcohol which is different from the one already present within the ester molecule. The two resulting enantiomeric carboxylic acid esters are however separable only by means of complex chromatographic methods so that this procedure is without practical importance. Conventionally, the enantiomeric separation is realized by lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis (U. T. Bornscheuer, R. J. Kazlauskas, <highlight><italic>Hydrolases in Organic Synthesis, </italic></highlight>Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved method for resolution of racemic alcohols or carboxylic acid esters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this object is solved by a method for kinetic resolution of racemates of alcohols or carboxylic acid esters with one or several stereogenic centers, in which by lipase-catalyzed reaction of racemic alcohols with fluorinated acylation agents or of esters of racemic carboxylic acids with fluorinated alcohols or of fluorinated carboxylic acid esters of racemic alcohols with water a fluorine phase marking of the faster or slower reacting enantiomer is possible. The enantiomers are subsequently extractively separated by distribution between the organic and fluorine-containing phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this connection, fluorine-containing solvents are to be understood as solvents with a high degree of fluorination which cannot be admixed with conventional organic solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, racemic alcohols with one or several stereogenic centers are acylated enantiomer-selectively by lipase catalysis with per-fluorinated acylation agents of the formula I </paragraph>

Subsequently, the per-fluorinated enantiomer is extracted with a per-fluorinated solvent which is immiscible with the non-fluorinated organic solvent. As an alternative, the lipase-catalyzed reactions are carried out in a per-fluorinated solvent and, subsequently, the non-fluorinated enantiomer is extracted by means of non-fluorinated organic solvents. </paragraph>

The phase homogenization during the chemical reaction is realized either by heating or controlled, gentle exposure to microwaves. The phase separation and the correlated product separation is achieved by cooling of the reaction mixture below the phase mixing temperature. In this way, the separation of the enantiomers can be performed with good yields. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the hydrolysis is carried out with a lipase of microbial, plant or animal origin either in solvents conventionally employed for such reactions, such as aqueous buffer solution or also with addition of a solvent miscible with water or immiscible with water in homogenous or heterogeneous phase. The pH value in the aqueous phase is maintained at constant values between 6 and 8, preferably at a pH of 7, by addition of suitable bases, such as aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide solution, as is conventional in the art. Subsequently, an organic solvent which is immiscible with water and a fluorine-containing solvent are added to the reaction mixture so that a three-phase system results. As an alternative to this procedure, the reaction mixture is extracted with a suitable organic solvent which is immiscible with water and the organic solvent is subsequently evaporated. The resulting residue is distributed between suitable organic and fluorine-containing solvents. After extractive separation, the released alcohol is isolated from the organic phase and the unreacted carboxylic acid ester is isolated from the fluorine-containing phase. The alkali salt of the released carboxylic acid remains in the aqueous phase. In this way the separation of the enantiomers can be performed with good yields. </paragraph>
