<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hair growth agent. Moreover, the present invention also relates to a cell activating agent and a hair fitness/body improving agent blended into a hair growth agent. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In today&apos;s society, namely an aging society and a stressed society, there are various factors causing hair loss. Research and development into superior hair growth agents is thus being carried out with vigor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The following are examples of effects of hair growth agents on hair: hair growth inducing effects (hair growth promoting effects, growth period inducing effects), hair thickening effects, hair growth period extending effects, 5&agr;-reductase inhibiting effects, blood circulation promoting effects, bactericidal effects, dandruff preventing effects, moisture retaining effects, antioxidative effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, despite the vigorous research and development into hair growth agents, the hair fostering action, namely hair loss prevention and hair growth effects and the like, of conventional hair growth agents has not always been adequate. This is because there are various causes of hair loss, and moreover the mechanism of hair growth is extremely complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional hair growth agents have been developed considering only the phenomena of &lsquo;hair growth&rsquo; and &lsquo;hair loss&rsquo;; there are few hair growth agents that have been developed by delving into the mechanisms thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One large reason for this is that hair fostering medicament test methods allowing easy verification of hair fostering effects focusing on the mechanism thereof had not been adequately established. In particular, it is difficult to establish a hair fostering medicament test method for verifying hair growth period extending effects. As a result, many conventional hair growth agents have been developed focusing not on growth period extending effects, but rather on hair growth inducing effects in which hair is induced during the hair growth period in the hair cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present inventors thus established a simple hair fostering medicament test method for testing for hair growth period extending effects that is carried out in vitro, and using this hair fostering medicament test method, discovered a component having hair growth period extending effects. Moreover, the present inventors discovered unexpected effects in that this component gives hair fitness and body and gives hair a feeling of volume, thus accomplishing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Objects of the present invention are as follows. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Following is a detailed description of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> N-methyltaurine, which is used in the present invention, is a compound represented by the molecular formula HNCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>H. Up until now, the hair growth period extending effects and effects of giving fitness and body to hair of N-methyltaurine have not been verified, and N-methyltaurine has not been used in a hair growth agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, &lsquo;hair growth agent&rsquo; refers to a hair-related product for the purpose of fostering hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the hair fostering medicament test method described below, the hair growth agent of the present invention has an effect of maintaining or extending the hair growth period by maintaining or promoting the division growth activity of at least hair follicle epithelial cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The hair fostering shampoo of the present invention is a preferable form in which the above-mentioned hair growth agent is used with cleaning components (surfactants etc.) mixed therein as a hair-fostering hair-cleaning agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the cell activating agent and the hair fitness/body improving agent are individual medicaments mixed into the above-mentioned hair growth agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The hair growth agent of the present invention is particularly effective in the case of alopecia caused by the growth period becoming short due to proliferation of hair follicle epithelial cells around the hair root being sluggish, and thus the proportion of resting period hairs relative to growth period hairs becoming high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> By using the hair growth agent of the present invention in combination with a hair fostering medicament having another individual effect, it is possible to achieve a combined or synergistic effect in the case of alopecia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The amount of N-methyltaurine mixed into the hair growth agent is determined as appropriate in accordance with the specific form of the hair growth agent, such that the effects of the present invention will be exhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The N-methyltaurine content is generally 0.00001 to 20 mass %, preferably 0.01 to 10.0 mass %, relative to the total amount of the hair growth agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If the N-methyltaurine content is less than 0.00001 mass %, then the hair growth period extending effect based on the hair follicle cell proliferation activating action or the outer hair root sheath cell proliferation activating action will be insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If the N-methyltaurine content is more than 20 mass %, then it will not be possible to expect an increase in the effects commensurate with the increase in the N-methyltaurine content. Moreover the tendency for there to be difficulties in preparing the desired pharmaceutical form will become marked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The hair growth agent of the present invention has a hair growth period extending effect based on an excellent hair follicle cell proliferation activating action or outer hair root sheath cell proliferation activating action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The hair growth agent of the present invention is thus particularly effective in the case of alopecia caused by the growth period becoming short due to proliferation of hair follicle epithelial cells around the hair root being sluggish, and as a result the proportion of resting period hairs relative to growth period hairs becoming high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by using N-methyltaurine and a hair fostering component having another individual effect in combination, it is possible to achieve a synergistic hair fostering effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, there are no limitations on the means for verifying the hair growth period extending effect (maintenance or extension of the growth period in the hair cycle). An in vitro characterization method or an in vivo characterization method can be used. Considering convenience and effectiveness, however, it is preferable to use an in vitro characterization method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Following is a brief description of a method of characterizing, in vitro, the cultured hair follicle epithelial cell proliferation effect in a hair growth period extending effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this method, an object substance is made to come into contact with cultured hair follicle epithelial cells in a serum-free medium, and thus the presence/absence or strength/weakness of the proliferation activity on the cells is characterized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The characterization method is a hair fostering medicament test method in which the effects of extending the growth period in the hair cycle are evaluated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> That is, it is an in vitro hair fostering medicament test method in which growth period extending effects in the hair cycle are characterized by focussing on hair follicle epithelial cells, which are directly related to hair elongation, and using cultured cells thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this hair fostering medicament test method, an object substance is made to come into contact with &lsquo;cultured hair follicle epithelial cells&rsquo;, which are cultured cells obtained by isolating hair follicle epithelial cells from an animal (including humans), and then the presence/absence or strength/weakness of the proliferation of these cultured cells is characterized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> &lsquo;Hair follicle epithelial cells&rsquo; refers to cells such as matrix cells and outer hair root sheath cells in the vicinity of the hair root in particular, with hair papilla cells on the inside being excluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The growth period in the hair cycle is the period when the hair elongates (the period when the hair follicle epithelial cells divide and proliferate). When this slows down, a regressive period and a resting period are entered, and hair growth stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A substance capable of extending the growth period in the hair cycle is thus capable of maintaining division and proliferation activity of the hair follicle epithelial cells. As a result, transition to the regressive period and the resting period in the hair cycle is prevented, and hair loss is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The hair growth agent of the present invention thus has an effect of promoting or maintaining hair follicle epithelial cell proliferation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Note that another in vitro hair fostering medicament test method is, for example, a method in which an object substance is made to act on hair papilla cells from an animal, and the proliferation effects are then judged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An example of a method of characterizing hair follicle epithelial cell proliferation effects in vivo is a method in which the object substance is administered to, for example, a nude mouse, and the state of hair growth sites on the body surface of the nude mouse is characterized, and hence the effects of the object substance in extending the growth period in the hair cycle are examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> That is, this is a hair fostering medicament test method in which a nude mouse, which is as a rule hairless but for which distinctive hair growth occurs in which hair growth sites shift on the body surface with time, is used, and by characterizing the broadness of the hair growth sites and the rate of shifting of the hair growth sites, the length of the growth period in the hair cycle is examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> There are no particular limitations on the pharmaceutical form of the hair growth agent of the present invention, provided that application to the scalp and head hair is possible. For example, a liquid, a milky lotion, an ointment or the like can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The hair growth agent of the present invention can be used in products such as hair tonics, hair creams, hair mousse (registered trademark), shampoos, rinses, creams, milky lotions and packs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferable product forms of the hair growth agent are hair fostering shampoos and hair fostering rinses. By using a hair fostering shampoo containing cleaning components (for example, surfactants) day after day, the hair fostering effects are readily exhibited, and moreover the hair is given fitness and body, and the hair can be given a feeling of volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Components generally used in cosmetics, non-medicinal products and medicines can be blended into the hair growth agent of the present invention as required, so long as this is within a range such that the effects of the present invention are not impaired, and preparation can be carried out using conventional methods. Such generally used components are, for example, powder components, liquid oils, solid fats, waxes, hydrocarbon oils, higher fatty acids, higher alcohols, ester oils, silicone oils, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, ampholytic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, moisturizing agents, water-soluble macromolecules, thickeners, film-forming agents, UV absorbers, metal ion sequestering agents, lower alcohols, polyhydric alcohols, sugars, amino acids, organic amines, macromolecule emulsions, pH regulators, skin nutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, antioxidant auxiliaries, aromatics, and water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Specific examples of components that can be blended in are as follows. One type or two or more types of the following components are blended in as necessary, and manufacturing is carried out using conventional methods in accordance with the desired pharmaceutical form. </paragraph>

The hair follicles were cut off at the lower part of the sebaceous gland, and enzyme treatment was carried out with collagenase and dispase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The hair bulb was cut off with scissors and excluded, and the hair shaft was separated with tweezers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The hair shaft was subjected to enzyme treatment with trypsin, and then the reaction was stopped with trypsin inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Centrifuging was carried out, the supernatant was thrown away, and the outer hair root sheath cells were recovered. </paragraph>

Taking this as a stock solution, dilution with the KBM medium was carried out, thus making the test substance concentration 10 nM, 1 &mgr;M, 100 &mgr;M or 10 mM. KBM medium only was taken as a negative control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Cellular DNA Measurement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The cells were thawed, and were then added to each hole of a Hoechst 33258, and smashed up with sonication. The cells were then transferred into a cuvette, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 356 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 460 nm. Taking the fluorescence intensity to be 100 for the negative control, the relative DNA amount was calculated, and hence the extent of cell proliferation was calculated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The hair of a 19-year-old woman with no history of any chemical treatment such as perming, coloring or bleaching was used. About 20 cm of the hair tip part was immersed in a prescribed shampoo solution for 1 hour, washed for 1 minute under running water, and dried for more than 24 hours in a normal environment; this was taken as a normal healthy hair sample. This normal healthy hair was bleached for 30 minutes at room temperature using a prescribed bleaching agent, and was then washed for 1 minute under running water. This bleaching treatment was repeated 4 times, and after washing, the hair was dried in a normal environment; this was then taken as bleached (BL-treated) hair. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> A single strand of hair was immersed overnight in 20 ml of a 1 mol/1 N-methyltaurine aqueous solution, and then the test sample hair was dried under a 25&deg; C. 50% RH environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Measurement of Torsional Torque </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Measurements were taken under a 25&deg; C. 50% RH environment using a KES-YN-1 torsion test apparatus made by Kato Tech. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Measurements were taken before treatment with the N-methyltaurine aqueous solution, with this being taken as a control. The twisting angle was &plusmn;1080&deg;, and twisting was carried out at a rate of 18&deg;/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> For a twisting angle &thgr;&equals;360&deg;&tilde;720&deg;, B&equals;tan(Tf/&thgr;), which is the increase in the torsional torque Tf with the twisting angle &thgr;, was taken as the torsional rigidity B, and evaluation was carried out using the ratio of the B values before and after the treatment with the N-methyltaurine aqueous solution. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> From the results, it can be seen that the torsional torque is increased for the hair treated with N-methyltaurine, and hence N-methyltaurine gives hair fitness and body. </paragraph>
