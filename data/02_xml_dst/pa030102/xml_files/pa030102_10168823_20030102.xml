<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for filling a space surrounded by a housing or casing with an inert gas and forming a desired gas atmosphere in the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, in a batch-type low-pressure CVD apparatus, a number of wafers are placed in a casing and a desired film is formed on a surface of each wafer by chemical vapor deposition. The wafer surface must be protected against oxidation due to oxygen or moisture contained in the ambient atmosphere, so as to prevent an oxide film from being formed on the wafer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To this end, conventionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> dry inert gas G is introduced through a gas introduction opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into a space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> surrounded by a casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and particles are removed from the gas by means of a particle-removing filter (such as an HEPA or ULPA filter) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to thereby form a dry, inert gas atmosphere in the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and prevent the above-mentioned oxidation. At the same time, the gas is discharged from the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a discharge opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at a predetermined flow rate, thus preventing contamination of the gas contained in the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thus, in such a system as mentioned above, an inert gas is used in a large amount, so that a running cost becomes inevitably high. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, the present invention has been made. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method which enable an inert gas to fill a space surrounded by a casing and form a desired gas atmosphere in the space, and are capable of reducing the amount of gas used therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> That is, the present invention provides an apparatus for forming a desired gas atmosphere, comprising: a casing having a gas introduction opening for introducing a gas into the casing and a gas discharge opening for discharging the gas from the casing; a gas circulating tube passage fluidly communicated with the casing for effecting circulation of the gas; a circulating fan for effecting circulation of the gas in the casing through the gas circulating tube passage; and a valve switchable between a position for conducting the introducing and discharging of the gas into and from the casing through the gas introduction opening and the gas discharge opening and a position for effecting circulation of the gas in the casing through the gas circulating tube passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In this apparatus, at an initial stage of operation, a gas is introduced into the casing through the gas introduction opening while the introduced gas is discharged through the gas discharge opening. This is continued until air which exists in the casing before operation is discharged from the casing and the casing is filled with the introduced gas. When the casing is filled with the introduced gas, the valve is switched so that the gas in the casing is subjected to circulation through the gas circulating tube passage. With the gas being circulated, a desired treatment for maintaining the gas in a predetermined condition, such as removal of moisture from the gas, can be conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the gas circulating tube passage can be connected between the gas introduction opening and the gas discharge opening. The switchable valves can be respectively provided at the gas introduction opening and the gas discharge opening so that the above-mentioned switching is conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the gas circulating tube passage, a filter for removing particles contained in the circulated gas and a trap for cooling and condensing moisture contained in the gas and removing the moisture from the gas may be provided. Further, a heat exchanger for effecting heat exchange between the gas which flows into the trap and the gas which flows out of the trap may also be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, in the casing, a gas flow equalizing mechanism may be provided in the casing for equalizing flow of the gas passed through the casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for forming a desired gas atmosphere in a space in a casing. This method comprises the steps of: introducing a gas into the space while discharging the gas from the space; and stopping the introducing and discharging of the gas when the space is filled with the gas, and circulating the gas in the space through a gas circulating passage communicated with the casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This method may further comprise the step of conducting a desired treatment with respect to the circulated gas, such as removal of particles. The method may further comprise the step of equalizing flow of the gas in the casing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, an embodiment of the present invention is described, with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an apparatus of the present invention comprises a casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such as that mentioned above and a gas circulating device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for circulating a gas through an inner space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the casing and forming a desired gas atmosphere in the inner space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As in the case of the above-mentioned conventional apparatus, the casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a gas introduction opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a gas discharge opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, as in the case of a CVD apparatus, the inner space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the casing is adapted to have an inert gas atmosphere, such as a nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) gas atmosphere or an argon (Ar) gas atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The gas circulating device has a gas circulating tube passage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> communicated with the gas introduction opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the gas discharge opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through switch valves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The switch valves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are switchable between a position such that the gas is supplied to and discharged from the inner space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a position such that the supplying and discharging of the gas is stopped and the gas in the inner space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is subjected to circulation through the circulating tube passage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A circulating fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided at the gas introduction opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Further, a gas flow equalizing mechanism <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to equalize flow of an inert gas in the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A heat exchanger <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are provided in the gas circulating tube passage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The trap is used for cooling an inert gas GI passed therethrough so that moisture or an organic gas (organic contaminate) contained in the gas are condensed and caught thereon for removal. An inert gas G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after removal of moisture or an organic gas is returned to the casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> effects heat exchange between the inert gas G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is introduced into the trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the inert gas G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is discharged through the trap so that the temperature of the inert gas G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> returned to the casing is maintained at a level higher than a predetermined temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an example of a general construction of the trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a side cross-sectional view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional view, taken along the line A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a cold head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a helium compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The cold head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a cylindrical condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is made of a material having good heat conductivity (a metallic material) and provided in the casing in a coaxial relation. The cylindrical compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to the helium compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a helium refrigerator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and is adapted to be cooled to, for example, &minus;100&deg; C. to &minus;200&deg; C. by means of a helium gas. The condenser has a number of radial fins. The inert gas G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has flowed into the casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cold head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cooled by the condenser, and moisture or an organic gas contained in the gas G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is condensed and caught on a surface of the condenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As a bearing for the circulating fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that a magnetic bearing be used and a magnetic bearing portion and a motor portion be imparted with a canned structure, in order to prevent contamination of the inert gas with particles or organic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To use the apparatus of the present invention, the switchable valves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are first brought into a non-circulation position and an inert gas G is introduced through the gas introduction opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the casing and discharged from the casing through the gas discharge opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The introduced gas G is passed through the circulating fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the gas flow equalizing mechanism <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in which the flow of the gas is equalized and introduced into the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is filled with the inert gas G while oxygen and moisture in the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are removed, the switchable valves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are switched to a gas circulating position. Consequently, the inert gas in the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is passed through the switchable valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the trap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the switchable valve <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the circulating fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the gas flow equalizing mechanism <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in which the flow of the gas is equalized and introduced into the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the amount of gas utilized can be reduced to a large extent as compared to the above-mentioned conventional technique. When the apparatus of the present invention is used as, for example, a batch-type low-pressure CVD apparatus, a number of semiconductor wafers are set in the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the casing and a nitrogen gas or an argon gas is introduced into the space and is subjected to circulation. Consequently, the concentration of oxygen and the concentration of moisture in the gas in the space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be suppressed to an extremely low level, and oxidation of the semiconductor wafer surfaces can be prevented. The inert gas should be supplementally added only in an amount sufficient for compensating for leakage from the casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a running cost can be reduced. </paragraph>
