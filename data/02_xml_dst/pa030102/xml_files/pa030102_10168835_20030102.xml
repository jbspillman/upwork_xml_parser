<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A high-speed rotary atomizer for applying powder coating comprises in a known manner a housing (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), in which a motor (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) is accommodated. The motor (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) rotates a bell-shaped plate (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) which is disposed at the front of the housing (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). At least one powder supply duct (<highlight><bold>28, 29, 22, 23, 24, 25, 11, 12, 9, 10</bold></highlight>) leads through the housing and opens at the front of the housing (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Its cross section can therefore be kept very large, thereby increasing the powder output of the high-speed rotary atomizer. This also enables a plurality of powder supply ducts (<highlight><bold>28, 29, 22, 23, 24, 25, 11, 12, 9, 10</bold></highlight>) to be laid, which in turn results in a higher powder throughput and improved homogeneity of the powder cloud which is produced. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a high-speed rotary atomizer for applying powder coating, with a housing; with a rotatable bell-shaped plate which is disposed at the front of the housing; with a motor which is accommodated in the housing and drives the bell-shaped plate, and with at least one powder supply duct which extends through the housing and emerges at the front of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The powder supply duct of known high-speed rotary atomizers of this type which are currently on the market leads through the hollow shaft of the motor and opens out at the front very near the axis of the bell-shaped plate. This arrangement entails two disadvantages: Firstly, the cross section of the powder supply duct may only be relatively small, which limits the powder throughput and thus the coating performance of the high-speed rotary atomizer. Secondly, the coating powder is brought into the range of action of the high-speed rotary atomizer very near the axis, where the speed of the atomizer is relatively low. This impairs the efficiency of the vorticity which is achieved by the bell-shaped plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to provide a high-speed rotary atomizer of the type initially mentioned whose coating performance is significantly better. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved according to the invention in that the powder supply duct leads through the housing radially outside of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the invention, the supply of powder to the bell-shaped plate through the housing no longer takes place through the hollow shaft of the motor. The entire motor is instead &ldquo;bypassed&rdquo; by the powder supply duct. The duct may thus be laid through a region of the housing in which there is sufficient space for large cross sections. The powder throughput is therefore no longer limited by geometric conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The configuration according to the invention may also comprise a plurality of powder supply ducts without any problems. It is in this case particularly advisable to provide a configuration in which a plurality of powder supply ducts are disposed radially outside of the motor in corresponding multidentate rotational symmetry. This achieves not just a very high powder throughput, but also very satisfactory homogeneity of the powder cloud which is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The powder supply duct may be formed at the interface between two parts, at least in one portion. The advantage of this lies in the fact that the inner surface of this region of the powder supply duct is immediately accessible and can be cleaned when the two parts are disassembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is in this respect particularly preferable for the two said parts to be the housing on the one hand and a housing insert on the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The use of high-speed rotary atomizers with so-called &ldquo;internal charging&rdquo; has recently increased. This term means that the high-voltage electrode by means of which the powder coating particles are ionized is located inside the housing of the high-speed rotary atomizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Internal charging&rdquo; is contrary to &ldquo;external charging&rdquo;, where the high-voltage electrode is generally provided as a ring, which surrounds the bell-shaped plate, outside of the housing. In the case of &ldquo;external charging&rdquo;, the air surrounding the outer electrode is firstly ionized, after which the coating powder is indirectly ionized via the latter, this having a relatively poor efficiency. In the case of &ldquo;internal charging&rdquo;, however, the coating powder particles are ionized through direct contact with the high-voltage electrode, this taking place more efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> If, therefore, the inventive concept is employed with high-speed rotary atomizers with internal charging, it is particularly advantageous to connect the housing insert, which partly defines the powder supply duct, as a high-voltage electrode. The coating powder is thus brought over a considerable distance through the housing into contact with a surface carrying a high voltage. This results in a very good ionization effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The housing and at least one housing insert may be of a conical formation in the front region and lie against one another with cone faces. This mechanical structure facilitates assembly and disassembly of the high-speed rotary atomizer, as the housing and the housing insert can be fixed in one direction by fitting the conical regions into one another and only require a fastening device at the opposite end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is preferable in this case for the cone faces of the housing and of the housing insert to be self-sealing and/or self-locking. This also facilitates assembly; special sealing means are unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The shaft of the motor which drives the bell-shaped plate generally has air bearings. An air bearing bush, in which the shaft of the motor is guided, is provided for this purpose. Bearing air is forced radially inwards through small ducts in the air bearing bush and thus forms an air cushion between the inner surface area of the air bearing bush and the outer surface area of the shaft. If an air bearing arrangement of this kind is used in the present invention, it is particularly advantageous for the shaft of the motor to be hollow and comprise radial bores via which the bearing air can pass into the interior space of the shaft, and for the interior space of the shaft to communicate with a through-bore in the bell-shaped plate which opens into the end side of the bell-shaped plate. According to the invention, the shaft is no longer required for supplying powder; it can now be used for other purposes, i.e. for supplying cleaning air to the bell-shaped plate for blowing off adhesions at this point. In this configuration of the invention the bearing air is supplied for a second purpose: Because it can enter the hollow shaft of the motor and be supplied via this to the bell-shaped plate, it does not emerge unused, as was previously the case, instead additionally performing the cleaning function.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention is illustrated in detail in the following on the basis of the drawings, in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an axial section through a high-speed rotary atomizer; </paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The high-speed rotary atomizer which is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is composed in one piece of a rear housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a radially extending annular shoulder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The rear housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>widens with a small cone angle in the direction of the back of the high-speed rotary atomizer; the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is also conical, although the cone angle is greater than that of the rear housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists entirely of a plastics material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An annular part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is likewise conical and likewise made of a plastics material, extends from the radially outer edge of the step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the housing to the front region of the outer surface area of the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The annular part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is sealed off from the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at both circular edges, so that it encloses with the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> an annular space <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This serves&mdash;in a way which is not of interest here&mdash;for the passage of guiding air, by means of which the shape of the powder cloud which is produced can be influenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is disposed coaxially inside the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which insert comprises a circular cylindrical rear region <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is relatively short in the axial direction, and a conical front region <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The front region <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ends in the vicinity of the front end of the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, two specularly symmetrical recesses <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are disposed at the inner surface area of the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>which recesses extend from the back of the step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the front end of the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and in so doing pass from an approximately circular cross-sectional shape into the cross-sectional shape of circular arc-shaped gaps. As illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the conical inner surface area of the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>lies via two webs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> against the conical surface area of the front portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The front portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the front housing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thus form two ducts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These ducts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are inclined with respect to the common axis of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that they converge in the direction of the front end of the high-speed rotary atomizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A radially extending flange <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is moulded onto the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> approximately in the transition region between the front region <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the rear region <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which flange extends parallel to the annular shoulder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, lying against the inside thereof. Two recesses <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which continue the ducts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, pass through the annular flange <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An air-driven motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is inserted in the appropriately stepped interior space of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of which motor extends coaxially with the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and with the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and passes through a through-bore <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The hub of a bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is locked onto the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that the bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rotates together with the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is fixed by means of a region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a greater radius to the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This is effected by clamping the motor region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the rear end side of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a pot-shaped holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. For this purpose the holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprises stepped bores <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, through which screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are led. These screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> pass through through-bores <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the motor portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and are screwed into threaded bores <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Two connection bushes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are led through a radially protruding flange region <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The rear end of a connecting tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is in each case fastened to the connection bushes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which tube is connected at its front end to a beryllium sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which passes through the through-bore <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively, in the flange portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well as the ducts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and lies against the inner surfaces thereof. This seals off the powder flow paths. It is alternatively also possible to dispense with this sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The rear end of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is closed by a connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which lies against the back of the holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, bears various air connections, not represented in the drawings, and also serves for fastening to the arm of a robot, which is not represented either. Two acceleration nozzle inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extend coaxially with the connection bushes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The exact function of these inserts is not of interest in this connection; their through-openings <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, are each aligned with the through-opening in the adjacent connection bush <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A respective connection nipple <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rear end side of the acceleration nozzle inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, again in alignment, this nipple being used for connection to a flexible tube, via which the powder is supplied from a reservoir. The connection nipples <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as well as the acceleration nozzle inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are fastened by screws <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such that, having loosened the screws <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the connection nipples <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can firstly be removed, after which the acceleration nozzle inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be withdrawn from the connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is retained at the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by means of a cap nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which abuts against a circumferential step of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is screwed onto an external thread <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The high-speed rotary atomizer can be mounted as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is firstly inserted in the interior space of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, where it is secured by means of the holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The connection bushes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which are inserted in the flange region <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the holding part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are connected via the tubes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the through-bores <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the flange portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The unit which is thus formed is now pushed into the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> until the conical surface area of the portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>lies against the webs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which likewise extend conically, of the inner surface area of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The cone angle may in this case be selected so as to produce a kind of self-locking and sealing effect like &ldquo;Morse tapers&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The connection plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is finally mounted on the rear end side of the holding insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, closing the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and fastened in this position by means of the cap nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The high-speed rotary atomizer is disassembled in a corresponding, reverse manner. The surfaces which define the ducts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can in this respect very easily be exposed for cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An air guide body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is of no interest in this connection, is mounted on the front end of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This body comprises a through-bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which surrounds the hub of the bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a spacing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown by the section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the air-driven motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is hollow. It is mounted in a bearing bush <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which comprises a plurality of very fine, radially directed through-bores <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The hollow shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also provided with a plurality of radial bores <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Its rear end, i.e. the right-hand end in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is closed by a closure body <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. However its front end, which is the left-hand end in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, communicates with a through-bore <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which bore opens into the front end face of the plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The radially outer side of the bearing bush <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is subjected to compressed air. This compressed air penetrates the small radial through-bores <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the bearing bush <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and in the first place provides a bearing air cushion between the bearing bush <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the motor shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The bearing air then passes through the radial bores <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the motor shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is routed in the interior space thereof to the front end and therefore to the through-bore <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is freed from adhesions when this air emerges at the front end side of the plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The described high-speed rotary atomizer functions as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The coating powder which is supplied via the connection nipples <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is firstly accelerated in the accelerator nozzle inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, for reasons which are of no further interest here, and then introduced via the tubes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into the sleeves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> passing through the through-bores <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the ducts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In so doing the coating powder sweeps along metallic surfaces, which are electrically connected to the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is directly ionized. It now emerges in this ionized form through the two arcuate exit gaps lying between the front end of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the front end of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, passes through the through-bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the air guide body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and is then spun by the rotating bell-shaped plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The shape of the powder cloud which is thus produced is influenced by a guide air stream which is routed along the outer surface area of the air guide body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a fashion which is not described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The described high-speed rotary atomizer therefore comprises two powder supply ducts, which are each formed by an accelerator nozzle insert <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which passes through a through-bore <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the flange <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a duct <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the electrode insert <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The eccentric routing of the powder supply ducts permits large flow cross sections to be implemented, so that high powder outputs can be achieved. The powder may also be directed past large electrode surfaces, so that good ionization can be achieved. </paragraph>
