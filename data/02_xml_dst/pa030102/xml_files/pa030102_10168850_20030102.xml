<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The internet telephone is being used nowadays instead of the conventional telephone that utilizes the PSTN line. The internet telephone works by transmitting and receiving voice data as internet protocol (hereinafter abbreviated to as IP) packet on the internet or an intranet. This technique is known as Voice over Internet Protocol (hereinafter abbreviated to as VoIP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A gateway device placed in between the telephone set and the route on the network is generally adapted as a device to implement this internet telephone. Refer to &ldquo;Nikkei Communication&rdquo;, the Jan. 2, 1999 issue, and pages 126-133 for the information related to gateway devices. There are a wide variety of gateway devices including a large-scale gateway device that supports a lot of telephone lines, and a small-scale gateway device such as a simple telephone adapter for connecting the conventional telephone set to the network. The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> shows an example of the conventional internet telephone adapter. For &ldquo;VolaLink-TA&rdquo; of NTT Corp., refer to http://vocalink.ssi.isp.ntt.co.jp/. For &ldquo;Solphone&rdquo; of Soliton Systems Corp., refer to http://www.soliton.co.jp/ and the brochure on the Solphone product. The internet telephone adapter comprises the following units: a digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>; a digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>; an IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>; a telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>; and a PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. One end of the internet telephone adapter is connected to a telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the other end is connected to the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Now, the operation is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Voice data spoken by the user are transmitted from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the telephone equipment adapter as analog signals. The digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> converts these analog signals to the digital signals. The digital signals are converted to the coded voice data by the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> processes the coded voice data as voice data packet. The voice data packet is transmitted to the IP network. The voice of talking user is transmitted to the other telephone set accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the voice data spoken by the talking user is being transmitted from the IP network as a voice data packet. The IP network communication processing unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> receives the voice packet data, analyses it, extracts the voice code portions from it, and decodes them to the voice data. Further, the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> converts the digital signal to an analog signal. The analog signal is transmitted to the user&apos;s telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The voice of talking user is heard at the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inputs the telephone number of the call destination telephone set. The inputted telephone number is converted to IP address. This is how the call destination telephone set is identified on the IP network. For instance, an information obtained by mapping of the telephone number and the IP address is previously stored in the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> receives the telephone number inputted from the telephone set. The telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> obtains an IP address based on the inputted telephone number by mapping. Accordingly, the communication destination telephone adapter is directly specified and accessed on the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The telephone set is directly connected to the PSTN line. The telephone set can be used in the usual manner. However, the telephone equipment adapter is connected to the IP network, and it is not connected to the PSTN line. This is the reason why the internet telephone cannot be used while the telephone set is connected to the telephone equipment adapter. To name the problem No. 1 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, while the telephone set is connected to the telephone equipment adapter, the user cannot make a telephone call via the PSTN line even by switching the connection from the IP network to the PSTN line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to make a telephone call by user either via the IP network side or via the PSTN line side while the signal line of the telephone set remains connected to the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 2 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, the IP address of communication destination telephone adapter must be registered beforehand in order to make a call using the internet telephone via the IP network. This manual inputting process done by the user is time-consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to discard such manual process of looking up the IP address of destination telephone equipment adapter and setting it to the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit of the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 3 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, a tele-conference that can verify and manage the participants is not possible via the IP network. Incidentally, the participants of the tele-conference must involve more than three individuals each carrying a telephone set and a telephone equipment adapter that is connected to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to perform the tele-conference via the IP network, among more than three individuals each carrying a telephone set and a telephone equipment adapter connected to it, where the participants of tele-conference is verified and managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 4 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, the requirement for an additional I/O device has inevitably increased the implementation cost of the internet telephone adapter. The additional I/O device specializes in the setup of configuration data for use in the maintenance operation, which needs to be incorporated to the adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention aims to reduce the cost incurred in attaching the I/O device specialized in setting up the configuration data. The I/O device is used for the maintenance operation. The configuration data is set from the general-purpose personal computer and existing telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 5 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, it is difficult to secure the real-time property of the voice data communication processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to improve on the real-time property of the voice data communication processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 6 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, the arbitrary UDP port cannot be used in the voice data communication processing via the firewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to carry out the voice data communication processing beyond the firewall by specifying several specialized UDP ports beforehand. The selected UDP port is used for the communication processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to carry out the voice data communication processing beyond the firewall by scanning the UDP port of the communication destination telephone equipment adapter and finding the usable UDP port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to carry out the voice data communication processing beyond the firewall by scanning the HTTP port of the communication destination telephone equipment adapter and finding the usable HTTP port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 7 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, inclusion of various types of protocol headers in the voice data packets tends to cause an increase in the amount of network traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to decrease in the amount of network traffic by using possibly the smaller various types of protocol headers in the voice data packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 8 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, the stable communication quality cannot be maintained when the IP network traffic condition is unstable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention aims to carry out the voice data packet transmission processing by responding to a monitored network traffic condition and by referring to a past record of the averaged network traffic condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To name the problem No. 9 of the conventional internet telephone adapter, the voice data cannot pass through the firewall when it is situated in between the adapter residing network and the outside network. The setup of firewall needs be modified to allow the voice data to pass through it. However, most firewall does not allow the request from the user to modify its setup because the firewall possesses its own management measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The internet telephone network system of the present invention attempts to solve these problems. The internet telephone can be used without having to modify the setup of the firewall by using HTTP port. The HTTP port is most commonly being used for the data transmission and reception, even if the firewall is situated in between the adapter residing network and the outside network. </paragraph>

For the purpose of simplifying the explanation, the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> altogether shall be regarded as &ldquo;calling side&rdquo; and the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> altogether shall be regarded as &ldquo;call receiving side&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> To being with, the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is power on in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and an IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> check whether or not there is any call from other telephone sets. If the call is ringing from the PSTN line side (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), then the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits a ringing tone inputted from the PSTN line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as it is. Then, the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> waits until the receiver of the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is picked up (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). If the receiver of the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not picked up or if the call from the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> finishes, then return to the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the receiver is picked up in step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the communication enters the communication mode via the PSTN_line, and the communication goes on until disconnected (steps S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). If the call is ringing from the IP network side, then the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits a ringing tone to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and waits until the receiver is picked up (step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). If the call from the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> finishes in step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, then return to the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the receiver is picked up, then in step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the communication enters the communication mode via the IP network, and the communication goes on until disconnected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The process procedure of step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is described in detail with reference to the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> checks if a data is received from the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The process ends if no data is being received. If the data is being received, then in step S<highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> deletes an IP header from the data received. Note that the received data is inputted from the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The received data is a digital voice data. The digital voice data is a packet information. Following on, in step S<highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> further deletes a communication protocol header from the data that removed the IP header. In step S<highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, the obtained digital voice data is decoded. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> converts the decoded digital voice data to the analog voice data. Then, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> transmits the analog voice data converted by the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits the transmitted analog voice data to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. After finishing the transmission of the analog voice data to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in order to decide if the communication should go on or not, the communication process continues by returning to step S<highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which shall be described later in the specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> What is meant by the communication mode mentioned in step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is that the analog_voice_data/digital_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>6000</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> converts an analog voice signal from the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a digital voice data. The digital voice data is transmitted to the IP network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. On the other hand, the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> converts the digital voice data transmitted via the internet/intranet to an analog voice data, and transmits the analog voice data to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Now, back to the beginning of the processes, in step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when there is no call from other telephone sets at all, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> confirms if a receiver of its own telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is picked up in step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At this time, if the receiver is not picked up, then return to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the receiver is picked up, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits a tone of notifying the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that it is ready for the telephone number inputting mode, and confirms the input of the telephone number in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> refers to the address translation table and obtains the IP address of the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> based on the inputted telephone number. If the IP address is obtained properly in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> creates a path selection information for transmitting and receiving the communication information via the IP network. The line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> activates the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> transmits a digital signal for calling the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The telephone sets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> enter a communication mode when the receiver of the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is picked up. The communication goes on until disconnected in step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The detailed explanation of step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> confirms if the receiver of the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is put back or not. Following on, in step S<highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> confirms if a voice is input by the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the set time. If a voice is input in the set time, then the analog_voice data/digital_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> converts the inputted analog voice data into the digital voice data. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> collects the voice data during a sampling time that is previously determined. The collected voice data during the predetermined time is converted from the analog data to the digital data. The digital voice data is transmitted to the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>. The converted digital voice data is handed over to the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>, and the voice data is compressed (coded) in step S<highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight>. Then, the IP_network_communication processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> attaches a communication protocol header to the coded voice data itself in step S<highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight>. Further, an IP header is attached to this data in step S<highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>. The created data is transmitted to the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight>. The process advances to the next stage of confirming the returning of communication information from the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as in step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Explanation of the processes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is omitted herewith. Refer to the detailed explanation of step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> If not translated properly to the IP address, then the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> creates a path selection information in such a way that allows the communication information to be transmitted and received via the PSTN line. The line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> switches the connection line to the PSTN line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and activates the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits a call tone via the PSTN line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a telephone set having a telephone number corresponding to the telephone number input by the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the communication enters the communication mode via the PSTN line if the destination receiver is picked up. The communication goes on until disconnected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The case in which the receiver of the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not picked up is not described in the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This is the case of disconnecting itself and returning to the first step of S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The telephone equipment adapter of Embodiment 1 connects a telephone line to both the PSTN line and the IP network. The telephone line such as PBX is connected by a typical telephone set (dial, push button type). The telephone equipment adapter decides if a telephone call can be made from a telephone set and can be connected to the destination telephone set via the IP network. Based on the decision, the line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> automatically switches the connection line. The telephone call is made via the IP network if decided as possible. However, if the telephone call cannot be made via the IP network, then the telephone call is made via the PSTN line. Such cases are as follows. The telephone number cannot be converted to the IP address. The destination telephone set is not connected to the IP network. The telephone equipment adapter between the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the IP network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not interchangeable to the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> As so far described if the call destination telephone set is geared for communication via the IP network, then the IP network side is used. If not, the PSTN line side is used to make a telephone call. With the automatic switching of the connection line to the IP network side or to the PSTN line side, the user only has to set up the telephone set and the telephone equipment adapter once. The user can transmit or receive communication information via any one of the PSTN line or the IP network as desired without too much trouble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 1 comprises the line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, and the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. The line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> switches the connection line based on a result of checking the possibility of connecting to the destination telephone set via the IP network when making a call from a typical telephone set connected to both the PSTN line and an IP network configured to IP communication (hereinafter simply referred to as IP network). The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits and receives a signal between the telephone sets on the PSTN line. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> transmits and receives the IP network signal of the IP network side. If the communication is possible on the IP network, then a telephone call is made via the IP network. If the communication is not possible on the IP network, then a telephone call is made via the PSTN line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 1 comprises the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> decides whether or not a telephone call can be made from a telephone set connected to a telephone equipment adapter to an another telephone set connected to the same type of telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. A telephone call can be made via the IP network accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 1 comprises the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> automatically translates a telephone number of a general PSTN line to the internet protocol address (hereinafter referred to as IP address) when the telephone call can be made via the IP network. This way, the telephone number that was being used by the user can be adapted as it is, to make a telephone call via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 1 comprises the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the analog_voice_data/digital_Voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> converts a digital voice data from the IP network to the analog voice signal for transmitting to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to allow for the voice communication from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected to the IP network side. The analog_voice_data/digital_voice data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> converts the analog voice data from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the digital voice data. The digital voice data is transmitted via the IP network side. The telephone call can be made via the IP network. This is made possible by the bidirectional conversion of digital voice data and analog voice data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 2, the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of destination telephone set transmits its IP address if that IP address is not registered in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the calling side. The IP address transmitted from the destination telephone set is registered to the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in the telephone equipment adapter of the calling side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> explains a learning function possessed by the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the Embodiment 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> telephone call is made from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If the IP address of the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not registered in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, then the following procedures will apply: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> 1. if the IP address is not registered in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a telephone call is made via the PSTN line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> 2. after finishing the call, the IP addresses are exchanged, and the received IP address is registered to their respective address translation tables <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> 3. the IP address stored in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is referred to make a second telephone call onwards via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The procedures <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> mentioned above is the learning function for obtaining the IP address of the destination side, which is equipped by the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a configuration diagram of each unit of the telephone equipment adapter of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits an IP address information upon putting the receiver back after a call is made via a general PSTN line. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> denotes an IP_address_learning_unit for giving an instruction to the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> for obtaining an IP address from the telephone equipment adapter connected to the destination telephone set. The IP address is mapped to the telephone number used in the conventional general PSTN line. The IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is provided at the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The operation of the telephone equipment adapter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is now described with reference to the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The whole process of making a telephone call is same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of Embodiment 1. That is, steps S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are equivalent to the steps S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The additional process to note in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> compared to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> is that if a telephone call cannot be made from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the IP network, then the IP addresses are exchanged after confirming that the telephone equipment adapter is of the same kind upon finishing the call. A similar process is added in both cases of making and receiving a telephone call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Operation of the former case, that is, the case of making a telephone call from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is now described. In step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the telephone communication via the PSTN line finishes. In step S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> instructs the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to transmit a tone signal to inquire if the destination telephone set is connected to the telephone equipment adapter of the same kind. As a result of the inquiry, in step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, if a configuration of the telephone equipment adapter of the destination telephone set is not interchangeable to the configuration of the telephone equipment adapter illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, then the process finishes because there is no response from the telephone equipment adapter of the destination telephone set after waiting for a pre-determined amount of time. If however, the telephone equipment adapter of the destination telephone set is of the same kind in step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, then there will be a response. So that in step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> instructs the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to transmit the IP address to the telephone equipment adapter of the destination telephone set using the analog signal tone. Its own IP address is stored in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> along with its telephone number. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> refers to the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and obtains its own IP address corresponding to its telephone number. Alternatively, the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may refer to the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for obtaining the IP address mapped to its telephone number, and may pass the obtained IP address onto the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Following on, the destination telephone equipment adapter transmits its IP address and the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> receives the IP address. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits the received IP address to the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> stores the received IP address along with the destination telephone number in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The operation of the latter case, that is, the case of receiving a telephone call is now described. In step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a telephone communication via the PSTN line finishes. The telephone equipment adapter of the destination telephone set making a telephone call transmits a tone signal for inquiring whether a telephone equipment adapter is interchangeable or not. The PSTN_lined_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> receives a tone signal transmitted from the telephone equipment adapter connected to the destination telephone set, and sends a response tone signal within a predetermined time in step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Return to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> if the inquiring tone signal from the destination telephone equipment adapter does not reach. After responding by sending a tone signal, the IP address of the destination telephone equipment adapter is transmitted, therefore, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> receives the transmitted IP address, and hands over the received IP address to the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The IP_address_learning unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> stores the destination telephone number and IP address to the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The destination telephone number is sent along with the IP address. Alternatively, in the case of receiving a telephone call from the destination telephone set, the destination telephone number is obtained and temporarily stored in the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> or the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Following on, the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> obtains its own telephone number and the IP address from the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and notifies the telephone number and the IP address to the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits the notified telephone number and the IP address by means of analog signal tone to the destination telephone set in step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Note that only IP address may be notified here. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 3, let&apos;s assume that the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is communicating with the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the IP networks <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. While communication is taking place between the two, a telephone call is made to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a telephone set <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The telephone set <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> requests to participate in the communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The operation is now described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The basic process of in making a telephone call is same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> of the Embodiment 1. However, unlike the situation in the Embodiment 1, the tele-conference is the communication is considered to be involving at least more than three individuals. A process of accepting the participation of a third individual who is using the telephone set <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is needed while the two individuals are talking to one another using the telephone sets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively. This being the case, a process of confirming the participation of the next individual during the process of step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is needed.

An extra process of confirming the tele-conference participants is described with reference to the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The additional process of confirming the participation of three individuals onwards is added to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> for describing the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> For the detailed description starting from step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and finishing at step <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>, refer to the step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. For the description starting from step <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> and finishing at step <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight>, refer to step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Since they are the equivalent processes, the descriptions are omitted herewith. Additional processes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are the step S<highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> for confirming an incoming telephone call from a third individual onwards, and the step S<highlight><bold>3001</bold></highlight> for adding a status of the new individual to the communication process if there is an incoming telephone call from the third individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> In the tele-conference, two individuals are communicating to each other via the IP network to begin with. Then, a third individual makes a call to either one of the two individuals via the IP network. At this situation, all of them are in the communication mode including the third individual. The same applies to the fourth individual onwards making telephone calls in the similar manners. The process of confirming the participation of the third individual onwards is as follows. The voice_data_mixing_unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> mixes more than two voice data other than your own voice received from the same kind of telephone equipment adapters connected to the other telephone sets via the IP network. For instance, the communication voices from the telephone sets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mixed by the voice_data_mixing_unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is output to the individual at the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the voice_data_mixing_unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is built-in to the telephone equipment adapter. Another possible configuration is having the voice_data_mixing_unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> as a separate unit for transmitting the mixed voices of the other participants by eliminating own one to the other telephone equipment adapter. In this case, there is no need to provide the voice_data_mixing_unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> to the other telephone equipment adapters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The procedures of confirming the participation to the tele-conference described above is a procedure of confirming whether there is any more participation of individuals after third individual onwards during two individuals are communicating to one another. A process of confirming whether the third individual is permitted in the tele-conference is not included in these procedures. If the communication among the three individuals is about a simple everyday matter of affairs and notification of liaison matters, there is no need to confirm whether the participating individual is a permitted one or not, however, as for the tele-conference, there is definitely a need for that. Such that in the Embodiment 3, in order to confirm whether an individual wishing to participate in the tele-conference is a permitted one or not, an identification number is attached to the tele-conference. Before the start of communication, the individual must input the conference identification number that is one of the permission data. Three methods are considered. First method is to attach a tele-conference identification number to the tele-conference, and inputs the tele-conference identification number by an individual before communication, and to decide if the inputted tele-conference identification number is correct one or not. The tele-conference identification number is one of the permission data. Second method is to confirm whether the telephone set is allowed for participation to the tele-conference based on the telephone identification number of the telephone set making a telephone call. The telephone identification number is another permission data. Note that in this method, the telephone identification number is attached to the telephone set beforehand. The third method is to confirm whether the password is correct one or not. The password is an another permission data input before starting communication. The three methods are described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> To begin with, the first method of setting the tele-conference identification number is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The tele-conference identification number is set to each tele-conference. The tele-conference identification numbers set are previously stored in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>. The tele-conference identification number is not stored in all of the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> of all of the telephone equipment adapters connected to the telephone sets participating in the tele-conference. The tele-conference identification number is only stored in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter of the telephone set of the Chairman in the tele-conference. The telephone equipment adapter connected to the Chairman&apos;s telephone set confirms whether or not the participant can join the tele-conference. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of the Chairman&apos;s telephone equipment adapter notifies a communication request from the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the tele-conference_identification_number_managing unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The tele-conference_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> that received the request notifies by means of voice data message to the telephone set that requested the communication to input the tele-conference identification number. When the tele-conference identification number is input by the destination telephone set who made the call, then the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> receives the inputted tele-conference identification number, and notifies the received tele-conference identification number to the tele-conference_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The tele-conference_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> refers to the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> and confirms whether or not the notified tele-conference identification number matches the tele-conference identification number being set there. If the tele-conference identification number matches, then the tele-conference_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> outputs a message of permitting the communication via the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. The destination individual hears the permission approval message. In addition to that, if the tele-conference identification number notified by the destination telephone set does not match the number set in the permission data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>, then the tele-conference_identification_number_managing unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> outputs a message of not permitting the participation to the tele-conference to the destination telephone set via the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the destination individual hears the message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Next, the second method of confirming the participation to the tele-conference based on the telephone identification number is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The telephone identification numbers of telephone sets that can participate in the tele-conference are previously set to the permission data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter connected to the tele-conference Chairman&apos;s telephone set. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter connected to the Chairman&apos;s telephone set receives the communication request from the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and notifies to the telephone_set_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> of the notification request. The telephone_set_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> notifies a message to input the telephone set identification number to the requesting telephone set. The individual at the destination telephone set hears this message. Next, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> refers to the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> and confirms whether or not the notified telephone identification number is being set there. If the telephone identification number is being set, then the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> outputs a message of permitting the participation to the tele-conference. The individual at the destination telephone set hears this message. If the notified telephone identification number is not being set in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>, then the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> outputs a message of not permitting the participation to the tele-conference. The individual at the destination telephone set hears this message. In addition to that, there are cases in which a single Chairman organizes a plurality of tele-conferences. In most of such cases, the number of telephone sets participating in a tele-conference varies. Under such circumstances, a telephone identification number is set to the tele-conference identification number described above. For instance, in the case of organizing three tele-conferences as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the tele-conference identification number is set as <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> for every tele-conferences. For the tele-conference identification number <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, the telephone set identification numbers are <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. For the tele-conference identification number <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight>, the telephone set identification numbers are <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. For the tele-conference identification number <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, the telephone set identification numbers are <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> It has so far been described that an individual who is making a telephone call from a telephone set inputs the telephone identification number. Alternatively, the telephone identification number is previously stored in the telephone equipment adapter connected to the telephone set, and the telephone_set_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter connected to the Chairman&apos;s telephone set may notify the telephone equipment adapter of the Chairman. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Next, the third method of confirming the participation to the tele-conference by inputting a password is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The password is stored in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> of the Chairman&apos;s telephone equipment adapter. The password has no use if it is breached to others. Therefore, it is important for the individuals to set his/her own password to protect the tele-conference identification number information beforehand. The method of setting the password is described in the other embodiment. In the Embodiment 3, let&apos;s say that the password is already being stored in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> of the chairman&apos;s telephone equipment adapter. The passwords are stored for every tele-conference identification numbers just like the telephone identification numbers of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of the chairman&apos;s telephone equipment adapter notifies to the tele-conference_attendance_password_managing_unit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> when received a communication request from the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tele-conference_attendance_password_managing_unit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> output a message to input the password to the destination telephone set. The individual at the destination telephone set hears this voice message. The individual of the destination telephone set inputs a password. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> receives the password and notifies the received password to the tele-conference<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>attendance_password_managing_unit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. The tele-conference_attendance_password managing_unit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> refers to the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> and confirms whether the received password is being set there. The passwords are set in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> based on the tele-conference identification number. Therefore, the tele-conference identification number and the password must be input at the same time. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> receives the password inputted from the destination telephone set along with the tele-conference identification number. The tele-conference_attendance_password_managing_unit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> notifies to the destination telephone set by sending a message of permitting participation to the tele-conference if the notified password and tele-conference identification number are set in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>. If they are not being set in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>, then a message of not permitting the participation is sent to the destination telephone set. The individual of the destination telephone set hears the voice notification message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The tele-conference identification number, the telephone set identification number, and the password are arbitrary combined to be used as a permission data used for confirming the participation to the tele-conference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the Embodiment 3, more than two voice data other than your own one received via the IP network from the other telephone sets connected to the telephone equipment adapters of this embodiment are mixed, and the voices are output. Hence, tele-conference by more than three individuals via the IP network is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the tele-conference identification number is set to the tele-conference. The tele-conference identification number must directly be specified and transmitted. Therefore, the tele-conference is possible among the specified participants via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone identification number is set to the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter. The telephone identification number of the telephone set is transmitted to the Chairman&apos;s telephone set. The Chairman is organizing the tele-conference. The tele-conference is possible via the IP network among the specified telephone sets via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the allocated password to each participant is managed for every tele-conference. Each participant inputs the password upon participating to the tele-conference. The inputted password is referred and compared to the registered password, therefore, the verification of the tele-conference participant is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 3 comprises the voice_data_mixing_unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> for mixing more than two voice data other than your own voice, and output the voices. This allows the tele-conference using telephone sets connected to telephone equipment adapters via the IP network by more than three individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system comprises the tele-conference_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> and the telephone_set_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The tele-conference_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> manages the tele-conference identification number of the tele-conference. The telephone_set_identification_number_managing_unit <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> manages the telephone identification number of the participants to the tele-conference. This way, participants of the tele-conference are verified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system comprises the tele-conference_attendance_password_managing_unit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> for managing and storing the password registered by the participants to the tele-conference. This way, the participants of the tele-conference are verified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 4, an example related to a configuration_data_storing_unit in the telephone equipment adapter is described. The configuration_data_storing_unit stores a data for controlling the telephone equipment adapter. An information for changing the configuration data stored in the configuration_data_storing_unit is input via the IP network or the PSTN line, and the data of the configuration_data_storing_unit is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a configuration of various parts in the telephone equipment adapter of Embodiment 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> denotes an IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit for inputting update information to change a configuration data that controls the telephone equipment adapter from the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and for changing the configuration data by accessing to the memory unit where the configuration data is stored. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> denotes a telephone_input_data_writing_unit for inputting the update information for changing the configuration data to control the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and changing the configuration data by accessing to the memory unit where the configuration data is stored. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> denotes a configuration_data_storing_unit for storing the configuration data to control the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> For instance, let&apos;s say that a maintenance operation of the telephone equipment adapter is taking place. An update information is input to change the configuration data by using push button on the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The PSTN_line_signal transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> receives the update information in a form of tone signal. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> hands over the received update information to the telephone_input_data_writing_unit <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. The telephone_input_data_writing_unit <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> accesses the configuration_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> according to the update information handed over by the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The configuration data is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the update information can be input by any telephone set other than the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the PSTN line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. By doing so, the configuration data stored in the configuration_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be changed from a distant location, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, for example, let&apos;s say that a personal computer is connected to the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The IP address of the telephone equipment adapter is specified from the personal computer connected to the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The update information for changing the configuration data is input to the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> receives the update information. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> hands over update information received to the IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> changes the configuration data stored in the configuration_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> according to the update information for changing the control information handed over by the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a configuration data for the purpose of maintenance operation is input from a pre-existing telephone set or a general-purpose personal computer connected to the telephone equipment adapter. The configuration data stored in the configuration_data_storing_unit is changed based on the inputted update information. Therefore, this can reduce the cost incurred in attaching an extra data input/output device to the telephone equipment adapter for the maintenance operation use. The users can easily carry out the set up of maintenance operation using the conventional devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the permission data such as a tele-conference identification number, a telephone identification number, and a password stored in the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> of Embodiment 3) are input from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter, from a personal computer connected to the IP network, or from a telephone set in the distant location. If a permission data is input from the telephone set, the telephone_input_data_writing_unit <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> accesses and permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> where the permission data is registered. If the permission data is input from a personal computer via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> accesses the permission_data_storing_unit <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> where the permission data is registered. The fact that the permission data related to the tele-conference is input and registered from the personal computer connected to the IP network or the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter allows the registration changing operation of the permission data related to the tele-conference considered to have a frequent registration changes such as new registration or changing and deleting the registered information easy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Following on, the operation is described with reference to the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19, 20</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> describe the same processes as in the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> of the Embodiment 2. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> describes the processes of Embodiment 5. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> operates at the communication situation that is transmission and reception processes of the voice data in the Embodiments 1, 2, 3 and 4. The Embodiment 5 shall be described using a case example of transmitting a voice data from the communication destination telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Prior to that, let&apos;s describe about a header which is used in transmitting and receiving the voice data by using the communication protocols UDP and RTP, with reference to the drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The configuration of voice data packets between the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the IP networks <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. In the Embodiment 5, the IP packet is constructed by attaching the following headers: an IP header <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a UDP header <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a RTP header <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The voice data is transmitted from the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The UDP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> takes out a packet that attaches the UDP header <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> except for the IP header <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the IP packet of the voice data. Then, the RTP_communication processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight> takes out a packet that attaches the RTP header <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from the packet that attaches the UDP header <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Then, the RTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight> transmits the digital voice data itself that has removed the RTP header to the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The digital_voice data/analog_voice_data_converting<highlight><subscript>&mdash;unit </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> converts the digital voice data to the analog voice data, and transmits the analog voice data to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the PSTN_line_signal transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. This case example has described that the analog voice data converted by the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the PSTN line signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. An alternative path is also possible. That is, the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> transmits the analog voice data to the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> via the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>, and the analog voice data is output to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Following on, let&apos;s now describe a case example of transmitting the communication information from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The analog voice data itself inputted from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is input to the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> via the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> converts the inputted analog voice data to the digital voice data by the analog_voice_data/digital_Voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The converted digital voice data is input to the RTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight> of the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. A packet that attaches the RTP header <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is created. Further, the UDP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight> creates a packet that attaches the UDP header <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The IP packet that attaches the IP header <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the destination telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> By utilizing UDP, if the voice data packet did not reach the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the voice data packet is not retransmitted. Owing to this fact, the real time property of the voice data communication is improved. In addition to that, by utilizing RTP, the transmission time and a number of the voice data packets are managed, therefore, the real time property of the voice data communication is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Next, in order to comply with the firewalls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> standing in a path of the IP network, the configuration for confirming whether the UDP port is usable or not is described. An information indicating that the communication destination is in the network environment blocked by the firewall is stored in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> along with the IP address. Since the information is stored in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the network environment of the destination is known when making a telephone call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The procedure of making a telephone call from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter, and the procedure of processing the received telephone call is same as Embodiment 2 described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. If the telephone call can be made to the destination via the IP network, then a confirmation process is executed which confirms an availability of port for communicating with the destination telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The communication procedures of the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are illustrated according to the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19, 20</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is the same process as a process described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> of the Embodiment 2. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is the same process as a process described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> of the Embodiment 2. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows a flow chart of an additional process in Embodiment 5. The steps from S<highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2406</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> are the processes that correspond to the step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, if the IP address is obtained based on the telephone number inputted from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by mapping, then the UDP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight> scans each port of the destination telephone equipment adapter via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and checks whether or not an arbitrary UDP port is accessible in step S<highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight>. The UDP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight> specifies a fixed port number and transmits data for confirming whether or not that port number is communication possible. If a reply data is reached within a certain period of time from the telephone equipment adapter connected to the destination telephone set, then we will know that port number is usable. If the access is possible at an arbitrary UDP port, then a port number of the UDP port is checked by the UDP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight>, and is set to the transmission destination port number of the UDP header <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the communication process of the voice data at that arbitrary UDP port starts in step S<highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight>. If the port number is not usable, then in step S<highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight>, confirm the possibility of communication to the previously specified UDP port that is managed and controlled by the UDP_port_usage_managing_unit <highlight><bold>5200</bold></highlight>. In general, the firewalls do not allow the use of arbitrary UDP port, however, the firewall can be set so that the limited and specified UDP port is usable. For this purpose, the limited and specified UDP port is previously managed and stored in the UDP_port_usage_managing_unit <highlight><bold>5200</bold></highlight>. If this is possible, then in step S<highlight><bold>2403</bold></highlight>, the communication processes of the voice data by using the specified UDP port starts. If this is not possible, another communication port is searched in order to find another possibility. In the example of this flow chart, the accessibility of the HTTP port that is normally used is being checked (S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>). However, in order to confirm whether the HTTP port is accessible or not as in step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>, a HTTP_port_communication_confirming_unit is needed, which will be described later in the Embodiment 6. In this example, if determined &ldquo;NO&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight>, the accessibility to the HTTP port is confirmed as possible. In step S<highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight>, if determined &ldquo;NO&rdquo;, then the process may be branched to the error notification process of S<highlight><bold>2406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> As described above, UDP or RTP having an excellent real time property is used in the communication process, therefore, the voice quality in the communication is improved. In addition to that, the firewall which in general does not allow the use of arbitrary UDP port is set so that the limited and specified UDP port is usable, and the UDP port number of that specified UDP port is stored in the telephone equipment adapter. This way, the voice data communication process beyond the firewall is possible. In addition to that, an usable UDP port by the firewall which in general does not allow the use of arbitrary UDP port is scanned even if the usable UDP port is unknown, that UDP port is searched and the voice data communication process is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 5, the internet telephone network system comprises the UDP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight>. The UDP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight> can process UDP as a communication protocol used in transmitting and receiving the voice data on the IP network, in the case of making a telephone call by the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. The voice data is transmitted and received by the UDP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone equipment adapter of the Embodiment 5 comprises the UDP_port_usage_managing_unit <highlight><bold>5200</bold></highlight>. The UDP_port_usage_managing_unit <highlight><bold>5200</bold></highlight> transmits and receives a voice data via the specified UDP port by controlling and storing the specified UDP port, complying to the firewall which plays a role of the security preventing the illegal access to the outside IP network from the IP network managed and connected to the telephone equipment adapter, installed at the IP network boundary, in the case of making a telephone call by the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. The stored UDP port is used for the voice data communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone equipment adapter of the Embodiment 5 comprises the UDP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight>. The UDP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight> checks for the availability of UDP port for transmitting and receiving data, complying to the firewall which plays a role of the security preventing the illegal access to the outside IP network from the IP network managed and connected to the telephone equipment adapter, installed at the IP network boundary, in the case of making a telephone call by the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. The UDP port that can transmit and receive the voice data is specified, and that UDP port is used for the voice data communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone equipment adapter of the Embodiment 5 comprises the RTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight>. The RTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight> can process the RTP as a communication protocol used in transmitting and receiving voice data on the IP network, in the case of making a telephone call by the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. The voice data is transmitted and received by the RTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 6 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Each part of the telephone equipment adapter in the internet telephone network system is described using the configuration drawings of the Embodiments 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the Embodiment 6, the detailed inner configuration of the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> can be applied to the drawings of Embodiments 1, 2, 3, and 4 as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The configuration diagram of the internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 6 is regarded same as the network configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> of the Embodiment 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight> denotes a TCP_communication_processing_unit for processing the Transmission Control Protocol (hereinafter abbreviated to as TCP) as a communication protocol for transmitting and receiving voice data on the IP network. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight> denotes a HTTP_communication_processing_unit for processing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (hereinafter abbreviated to as HTTP) as a communication protocol for transmitting and receiving voice data on the IP network. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>5900</bold></highlight> denotes a HTTP_port_communication_confirming_unit for checking the availability of HTTP port where the data can be transmitted and received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The operation is described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Similar to the Embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 6 operates in regard to the transmitting and receiving processes of the voice data taking place during the communication. When a voice data is transmitted from the destination telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected to the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the TCP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight> receives the IP packet of the transmitted voice data. The TCP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight> takes out a packet that attaches the TCP header and removes the IP header from the IP packet. Next, the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight> takes out a packet that attaches the HTTP header from a packet which attaches the TCP header, and transmits the digital voice data that has removed the HTTP header to the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> transmits the digital voice data converted to analog voice data to the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The PSTN_line signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits the analog voice data to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this example, the analog voice data is transmitted to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the analog voice data can be transmitted from the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> bypassing the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> via the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Next, let&apos;s describe the case in which the analog voice data input by the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The analog voice data itself inputted from the telephone set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> goes through the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and is inputted to the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> transmits the analog voice data itself to the analog_voice_data/digital_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The analog_voice_data/digital_Voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> converts the analog voice data to digital voice data. The HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight> attaches an HTTP header and forms a packet. Continuing on, the TCP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight> creates a packet that attaches the TCP header. The IP header is attached. This is transmitted to the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the IP packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 5, the HTTP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5900</bold></highlight> checks whether or not the UDP port is usable as shown in step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. If the UDP port is not usable at all, then the HTTP_port_communication_confirming_unit <highlight><bold>5900</bold></highlight> takes a sequential step of checking whether the HTTP port is usable or not, and carries out the voice data communication by HTTP if the HTTP port is usable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As described above, in most of the cases, the UDP port is not usable due to the typical firewall. However, normally, the HTTP port is open, and the voice data communication is carried out by using the HTTP message, therefore, the communication is implemented via the IP network despite of the firewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> The internet telephone network system of Embodiment 6 comprises the TCP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Various units of the telephone equipment adapter of the internet telephone network system is described in the configuration drawings of Embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In the Embodiment 7, the detailed inner configuration of the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> can be applied to the drawings of Embodiments 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The configuration diagram of the network system of the Embodiment 7 is regarded same as the network configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> of Embodiment 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>5500</bold></highlight> denotes a voice_data_packet_encoding_unit for compressing the voice data itself, and for changing a header of packet having a standard format such as RTP and HTTP to a compressed header restricted down to minimum necessary information. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>5600</bold></highlight> denotes a voice_data_packet_decoding_unit for decoding the compressed voice data itself received, and analyzing the compressed header, and obtaining the header of packet having a standard format such as RTP and HTTP. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight> denotes a receiving buffer unit for converting a digital voice data to an analog signal, and for changing the buffer size so that the analog signal is transmitted at a constant delayed timing, and for temporarily storing the digital voice data packet received at a discontinuous timing due to change in the network traffic, from a destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the IP network. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>6200</bold></highlight> denotes a transmission buffer unit for creating a digital voice data packet for transmission in the case of transmitting the digital voice data packet to the destination telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and for performing an additional process of creating a packet using only a required voice data accumulated in the transmitting buffer where the buffer size can be modified before transmitting it. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight> denotes a redundant_packet_issuing_unit for transmitting a variable number of the same voice data packet copies. When the digital voice data packet is being transmitted to the telephone set <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the IP networks <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the multiple copies of the same voice data packet are transmitted. This is done in order to comply with a loss of the voice data packets that reflect on the network traffic condition. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>6400</bold></highlight> denotes a packet_generation_filtering_unit for deducing the number of voice data packet subjected to transmission for deducing the network traffic in the case of transmitting the digital voice data packet to the telephone set connected to the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.

The reference numeral <highlight><bold>6600</bold></highlight> denotes a network_traffic_statistical_data_managing_unit for accumulating the statistical data of the network traffic condition, and calculates a parameter showing the average traffic condition at a day or a weekly cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The operation is described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> In the similar manner as the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of Embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 7 operates during the communication situation of transmitting and receiving processes of the voice data. The basic operation of the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 7 is executed in the similar manner as the IP_network_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> of Embodiments 5 and 6. In the Embodiment 7, the voice data is transmitted to and extracted from the RTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight> and the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight>. The voice_data_packet_encoding_unit <highlight><bold>5500</bold></highlight> compresses the voice data, the HTTP header and the RTP header. The voice_data_packet_decoding_unit <highlight><bold>5600</bold></highlight> decodes the voice data, the HTTP header and the RTP header. Instead of the standardized header format, the RTP header and HTTP header compression remake a compact header by bringing together only the minimum necessary informations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, since there are various data traffics existing on the IP network, the voice data packets may not arrive continuously at a constant time interval. Such variation in the arrival time of each packet is referred to as a transmission time fluctuation. Accumulating the voice data packets in the receiving buffer upon receiving the packets absorbs the transmission time fluctuation. The packets are then output to the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> that is an analog side at a constant time interval from the receiving buffer. By doing so, provided that it is within the capacity of the receiving buffer, the output timing of the voice data to the output side is going to be constant even if a delay occurs in a packet such that the regenerated voice is not broken. This process is performed at the receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight>. The receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight> includes a receiving buffer <highlight><bold>6101</bold></highlight> that executes the above-mentioned process. There is going to be a delay in regenerating the voice while the voice data packets are accumulating in the receiving buffer <highlight><bold>6101</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the size capacity of the receiving buffer cannot always be increased since this also increases the delay. To give an extreme example, if there are fluctuation in the arrival times of the voice data packets transferred via the IP network, a conversation such as &ldquo;good-morning&rdquo; may be heard as &ldquo;goo . . . do . . . mo.or . . . nin . . . g&rdquo;. Whereas the &ldquo;. . . &rdquo; is the time gap being inserted between the conversation. The time gap is referred to as broken voice. The receiving buffer is prepared in order to compensate for the time gap. The regeneration time as a whole is delayed. The broken voice is removed this way. These are the receiving buffer processes. The larger the size of the receiving buffer, the smaller the broken voice. The voice quality improves but the delay as a whole increases, therefore, the communication timing is delayed such that it is difficult to hear. In other words, if the receiving buffer size is increased, the fluctuation is absorbed that the voice quality improves. On the other hand, the delay is increased to cause difficulty in hearing them. If the receiving buffer size is decreased, the voice quality deteriorates but the talk timing improves. The receiving buffer size is decided by the trade-off of both characteristics. An optimum value must be set by considering them. However, in reality, the optimal value changes depending on the network traffic condition. At the receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight>, the size capacity of the receiving buffer <highlight><bold>6101</bold></highlight> is changed according to the arbitrary condition. In addition to that, to comply with a frequent occurrence of buffer overflow, the size capacity of buffer is set larger, and only one part of the data is transmitted to the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that is the regenerating side. In such cases, not only the size capacity of the receiving buffer but also the data size for transmitting to the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which is the regenerating side must be controlled and change depending on the various conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, likewise, in order to comply with the various data traffic conditions on the IP network, the voice data packet size of the receiving side for transmitting to the IP network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is changed. For this purpose, the transmission buffer unit <highlight><bold>6200</bold></highlight> includes a transmission buffer <highlight><bold>6201</bold></highlight>. The transmission buffer unit <highlight><bold>6200</bold></highlight> accumulates a certain amount of voice data at the transmission buffer <highlight><bold>6201</bold></highlight> before they are transmitted. The smaller the voice data packet size for transmission the less frequent the delay. The communication quality improves. However, each packet always carries a header having a certain size. There is going to be a limit in making the packet size small. In addition to that, by making the packet size small, the number of packets increases. Therefore, the amount of network traffic is enlarged. Accordingly, the size of receiving buffer is controlled to change depending on the network traffic condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, likewise, in order to comply with various data traffic conditions on the IP network, in preparation to the frequent occurrence of transmission data packet loss in UDP communication process, there is a measure to transmit a multiple copies of the voice data packet having an identical content as a back-up. This process is executed by the redundant_packet_issuing_unit <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight>. The redundant packets are not always issued. There is a need to adjust the amount of redundant packets being issued in order to delete the unnecessary packets since all the packets are delayed when the network traffic increases. The redundant packet issuance is controlled in the case of frequent occurrence of packet loss and when the network traffic is not increased so that the packet loss is deduced and the communication quality increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, likewise, in order to comply with various data traffic conditions on the IP network, if the network traffic increases, those voice data packet that does not affect the communication quality is not transmitted in order to deduce the amount of transmission data. The packet_generation_filtering_unit <highlight><bold>6400</bold></highlight> executes such control process. As a filtering condition, there is a set up of eliminating a voice data below a certain volume level. As for the human perception, it is already being recognized that there is no influence on the communication even if a volume below certain level is not regenerated. Accordingly, when the network traffic is increased, the amount of voice data for elimination is controlling the elimination of the level of voice data volume upon transmission. This way, the communication continues without having to lose the communication quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, likewise, in order to comply with various data traffic conditions on the IP network, we have discussed the importance in carrying out various communication controls at various units in regard to the communication process. Herewith, in order to grasp the network traffic condition, the network_traffic_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>6500</bold></highlight> records the timing of receiving the voice data packet intermittently. Due to this, the network traffic amount is inferred, and the condition for the communication control above is appropriately changed. For example, for the case of receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight>, if the network_traffic_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>6500</bold></highlight> recognizes that the network traffic is increased, it notifies the receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight> to increase the size capacity of the receiving buffer <highlight><bold>6101</bold></highlight>. If the receiving buffer size capacity is increased, the packets are handed over to the digital_voice_data/analog_voice_data_converting_unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> after a certain amount of the packets are accumulated in the receiving buffer <highlight><bold>6101</bold></highlight>. The network traffic is resolved this way. On contrary, if the network traffic is less, since the packet arrives to the telephone equipment adapter at a stable timing therefore, the network_traffic_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>6500</bold></highlight> notifies to the receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight> to decrease the size capacity of the receiving buffer <highlight><bold>6101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, likewise, in order to comply with various data traffic conditions on the IP network, a statistical data are used to change various parameters. These parameters control the communication above. The monitored and accumulated data at the network_traffic_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>6500</bold></highlight> is received by the network_traffic_statistical_data_managing_unit <highlight><bold>6600</bold></highlight>. The network traffic_statistical_data_managing_unit <highlight><bold>6600</bold></highlight> supplies information to control communication that is needed by the receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight>, the transmission buffer unit <highlight><bold>6200</bold></highlight>, the redundant_packet_issuing_unit <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight>, and the packet_generation_filtering_unit <highlight><bold>6400</bold></highlight>. The network_traffic_statistical_data_managing_unit <highlight><bold>6600</bold></highlight> presents a trend of average network traffic at one-day cycle or a weekly cycle. The information is referred and used to carry out communication control by various units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In the configuration drawing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the communication processing unit includes the RTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight> and the UDP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight>. In the configuration drawing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the communication processing unit includes the TCP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight> and the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight>. The following units are shared in the configuration drawings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>: the receiving buffer unit <highlight><bold>6100</bold></highlight>; the transmission buffer unit <highlight><bold>6200</bold></highlight>; the packet_generation_filtering_unit <highlight><bold>6400</bold></highlight>; the network_traffic_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>6500</bold></highlight>; and the network_traffic_statistical_data_managing_unit <highlight><bold>6600</bold></highlight>. The redundant_packet_issuing_unit <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight> is only included in the configuration drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. This is because the redundant_packet_issuing_unit <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight> relates to the UDP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight>. Since it carries a characteristic of transmitting the data to the destination without establishing the UDP session, the UDP itself does not have a function to deal with packet loss even if the packet loss is frequent. This being the case, the redundant_packet_issuing_unit <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight> is provided for supporting the UDP. On the other hand, TCP carries a characteristic of re-try many times until the data is definitely communicated since it starts communication after the session is established. This being the case, TCP does no need to support re-try function. This is the reason why the telephone equipment adapter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> does not include the redundant_packet_issuing_unit <highlight><bold>6300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the headers of communication voice data packet is individually compressed. Such that the packet size can be made smaller than its standard size. The network traffic is deduced. What is meant by the individual compression is, for example, the packet size is made small by using the header information compression program. It indicates compressing only those data needed by the telephone equipment adapter that is the element of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, even if there are fluctuation in the transmission time of each voice data packet subject to communication, the voice data packets are accumulated until they attain a certain size upon reception, and transmitted to the analog regeneration side, therefore, even if the network traffic condition is unstable, a stable communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, upon transmitting each voice data packet subjected to communication, the packet size is made small if the amount of network traffic is less, and the packet size is made large if the network traffic is more. Even if the network traffic condition is unstable, a stable communication quality is maintained without influencing the network traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the redundant packet is issued upon a frequent occurrence of the packet loss upon transmitting each voice data packet subjected to communication, therefore, a stable communication quality is maintained even in the condition when the packet loss is frequent due to the network traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, if the amount of network traffic is increased upon transmitting each voice data packet subjected to communication, those voice data packet that do not affect the communication quality such as those below a certain volume level are not transmitted, therefore, a stable communication quality is maintained despite of increased amount of network traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, various parameters in the communication processes described above are adjusted according to the estimated network traffic condition and the measured receiving timing of each voice data packet subjected to communication, therefore, the optimal communication process is possible responding the updated condition of the network traffic. A stable communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the results of measured timing of receiving each voice data packet subjected to communication are accumulated, and it is referred to as a data for showing the network traffic condition at a day cycle or a weekly cycle, therefore, the optimal communication process is controlled responding to the average network traffic condition. A stable communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 7, the internet telephone network system comprises the voice_data_packet_encoding_unit <highlight><bold>5500</bold></highlight> and the voice_data_packet_decoding_unit <highlight><bold>5600</bold></highlight>.

The voice_data_packet_decoding_unit <highlight><bold>5600</bold></highlight> obtains a packet header having a standard format such as RTP or HTTP, and analyzes the compressed header by decoding the compressed voice data received. By deducing the amount of data, the communication data is efficiently transmitted and received. </paragraph>

The optimal transmission/reception processes are implemented responding to the network traffic condition. The excellent quality voice data is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 7 utilizes the network_traffic_statistical_data_managing unit <highlight><bold>6600</bold></highlight> to calculate parameters indicating the average traffic condition at a day or weekly cycle, by accumulating the statistical data of network traffic condition received from the network_traffic_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>6500</bold></highlight> which monitors the timing of receiving the voice data packets via the IP network.

The reference numeral <highlight><bold>7100</bold></highlight> denotes an HTTP polling unit for checking the communication situation of the destination telephone equipment adapter stored in the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> by using inquiry information by means of HTTP access polling. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>7200</bold></highlight> denotes a telephone_call_communication_unit for reporting that the destination telephone equipment adapter is receiving a telephone call when the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects that the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by firewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The drawings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference> show the first and the second examples of various units of the HTTP_relay_server_managing_server of the internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>9200</bold></highlight> denotes a HTTP_relay_server_assigning_unit for monitoring the load situation of the plurality of HTTP relay servers. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>9100</bold></highlight> denotes a HTTP_relay_server_load_monitoring unit for specifying the HTTP relay server used in the communication process based on the inquiry from the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> In the first example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29, a</cross-reference> plurality of the HTTP relay servers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> are prepared, and the HTTP relay server managing server for managing them is described. In the second example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the HTTP relay server <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extracts the processing units required in negotiating connection with the telephone equipment adapter. The processing units extracted is built into the HTTP_relay_server_managing_server <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The HTTP_relay_server_managing_server <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> carries out the connection negotiation. In this case, after negotiating connection, the voice data transmission and reception processes are performed only in the TCP/IP_packet_header_alteration_unit <highlight><bold>8400</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the HTTP relay server only builds in the TCP/IP_packet_header_alteration_unit <highlight><bold>8400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> The operation is described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> To begin with, the network configuration comprising the telephone equipment adapter and the HTTP relay server is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>(A) shows a method of executing the HTTP relay server by assuming it as a provider. There are two methods of checking if a telephone call is being made to the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter. The method one is checking information stored in the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> by a periodic polling. The telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> is a management area of the HTTP relay server <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the method two includes checking from outside by mailing, by instant message, and by PSTN call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In the drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>(B), the telephone equipment adapters <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are in the network environments protected by the firewalls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The network environment provided with external WWW server or proxy is protected by the same firewall. In such environment, the HTTP relay server program is executed in the external WWW server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> In the drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>(C), a telephone terminal that can communicate with a dedicated terminal (i.e., terminal executing the HTTP relay server program) is placed in the network environment protected by the firewall. The method of communication between the dedicated terminal and the telephone terminal is considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment indicates three configuration (A), (B), and (C). The configuration (A) is described based on the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</cross-reference>. The configuration (A) is the polling method of executing the HTTP relay server at the provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> The procedure of making a telephone call from one telephone equipment adapter to the other telephone equipment adapter starts as follows. First of all, the user picks up the receiver of the telephone set calling side and inputs a telephone number. The telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> translates the inputted telephone number to the IP address. Refer to Embodiment 1 for the method of translating to the IP address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> (The Polling Method) In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, the telephone number is translated to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>S IP address. If translated properly to IP address in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, then in step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the HTTP telephone call <highlight><bold>7300</bold></highlight> sets a flag information related to IP address trying to make a telephone call. The flag is set in the management area of each IP address of the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> inside the HTTP relay server <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The management area of each IP address of the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> is periodically referred by the HTTP polling unit <highlight><bold>7100</bold></highlight> of the communication destination telephone equipment adapter. Such that the telephone equipment adapter connected to the destination telephone set will know that the telephone call is being received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> (Mail and Instant Messages) The telephone number translated to IP address is confirmed in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. Next, the telephone_call_communication_unit <highlight><bold>7200</bold></highlight> transmits a mail or instant message to the communication destination telephone equipment adapter, and notifies to the destination telephone set that the telephone call is received. The process of the mail or the instant message is not particularly illustrated in the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> (Notified by telephone call via PSTN) The telephone number is translated to IP address properly in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. Next, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> makes a telephone call to the destination telephone set from the PSTN side. The telephone equipment adapter connected to the destination telephone set will know instantly that the telephone call is being received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Then, the destination telephone equipment adapter transmits a call tone to a telephone set connected for commencing the communication (Step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). If the receiver of the destination telephone set of the call receiving side is picked up in steps S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, then the communication mode is entered in step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and their respective telephone equipment adapters go and get the destination communication data. Depending on the requirement, the communication data spoken by them are transmitted to the HTTP relay server in steps S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. This continues on until disconnected. The unit where the communication data transmitted from the telephone equipment adapter is temporarily stored until the other telephone equipment adapter gets them is the voice data buffer. The voice_data_buffering_unit <highlight><bold>8100</bold></highlight> executes the transmission and reception process of the voice data of this communication. The steps S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> are the procedure of receiving a telephone call, entering the communication mode, communication taking place, and continuing communication. The steps S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are the procedure of making a telephone call to the destination telephone set, picking up the receiver of the destination telephone set is to enter the communication mode, and the communication goes on until disconnected. Two telephone sets communicating via the HTTP relay server is same for both cases of receiving a call and making a call. The communication data transmission and reception processes via the HTTP relay server by two telephone sets in the communication mode described above is equivalent to the process from step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. Next, a flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> describes the polling method by using the HTTP relay server The HTTP relay server <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> only accepts HTTP access among from the outside access via the IP network. In step S<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight> confirms that the data is received by using HTTP access. The HTTP access exists just in the polling method for confirming if a telephone call is being made to itself from each telephone equipment adapter. Other than that, the following accesses exist: the access for making a new telephone call to other telephone set; the access for obtaining the voice data for itself; and the HTTP access for liaison disconnection communication. In step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, when the HTTP access decides to make a new telephone call to other telephone set, then the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> accesses the communication destination management area, and checks if the telephone is in the communication in progress in step S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. If the telephone is in the communication in progress mode, then HTTP message indicating communication in progress is replied in step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, if not, the HTTP message indicating that the telephone started to ring is replied in step S<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. If the communication mode is entered, the voice data delivered from the telephone equipment adapter are temporarily accumulated in step S<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The voice_data_buffering_unit <highlight><bold>8100</bold></highlight> manages so that the other telephone equipment adapter collects them. If there are communication data in the destination voice data buffering area, then in step S<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the voice_data_buffering_unit <highlight><bold>8100</bold></highlight> and the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight> transmits that communication data as the HTTP reply message to the telephone equipment adapter connected to the communication destination telephone set. In addition to the process of step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, if HTTP access for confirming whether or not the telephone call is being made to its telephone equipment adapter, the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> checks the management information if the telephone set is ringing connected to the telephone equipment adapter of the confirmation requesting origin in step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As a result of checking, if the telephone call is being made in step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, then in step S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight> transmits the information to the telephone equipment adapter connected to the telephone set of the confirmation requesting origin. In addition to the process of step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, if decided as HTTP access for disconnecting the communication, then in step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> changes the information to indicate that both management information of communication origin and destination are in the waiting mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> As described above, a typical firewall can access to the outside Internet by using HTTP, and the telephone equipment adapter can carry out the communication process and telephone call via the HTTP relay server, therefore, the telephone call is made via the IP network without having to modify the set up of the typical firewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> The HTTP relay server carries out communication data transmission and reception after negotiating process of connecting to the first telephone equipment adaptel This process load is going to be a heavy one. Henceforth, the communication data transmission and reception are carried out directly between the telephone equipment adapters without bypassing the HTTP relay server. The load put on the HTTP relay server is reduced this way. Even if many users make telephone calls so that the process concentrates, the process continues and the communication quality is maintained. Due to this, the HTTP_connection_changing_unit <highlight><bold>8300</bold></highlight> negotiates the first connection and changes the connection from the HTTP and TCP connection to the connection between both adapters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> As described above, the communication data transmission and reception is carried out directly between the telephone equipment adapters without bypassing the HTTP relay server. This reduces the load put on the HTTP relay server. Even if the communication process concentrates due to many users making telephone calls, the process continues, and the communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> In addition to the HTTP relay server described above, it also carries out communication data transmission and reception after negotiation process of connecting to the first telephone equipment adapter. This process load is going to be a heavy one. In order to reduce the load put on the HTTP relay server, the process performed by the HTTP relay server is limited down as much as possible by executing the simple processes only. This is executed by the TCP/IP_packet_header_alteration_unit <highlight><bold>8400</bold></highlight> for directly converting the port number of TCP header and IP address of IP header inside the transmitted voice data packet from both telephone equipment adapters to the HTTP relay server to the port number and IP address of the final transmission destination telephone equipment adapter, at a point when the communication process preparation is ready by connecting both telephone equipment adapters communicating by the HTTP relay server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> As described above, as the process on the HTTP relay server, the communication data transmission and reception are carried out by converting the port number of TCP header and IP address of IP header inside the transmitted voice data packet from both telephone equipment adapters to the HTTP relay server to the port number and IP address of the final transmission destination telephone equipment adaptel This can reduce the load put on the HTTP relay server. Even if the communication process concentrates due to many users making telephone calls, the process continues, and the communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in order to carry out an efficient communication process at the HTTP relay server, if a number of telephone equipment adapters requesting the communication process increased accompanied by the increased number of the users, since there is a performance limit in one HTTP relay server, it will fail at some point. Therefore, a plurality of HTTP relay servers is prepared. A favorable communication is maintained to various by dispersing the communication process of various telephone equipment adapters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> A HTTP_relay_server_managing_server for integrating and managing the plurality of HTTP relay servers is required. The relationship between the HTTP_relay_server_managing_server and the HTTP relay server is illustrated in the drawings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference>. A first telephone equipment adapter inquires the HTTP_relay_server_managing_server <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The HTTP_relay_server_load_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>9100</bold></highlight> for monitoring the load situation on the plurality of HTTP relay servers finds the HTTP relay server having a small number of users. The HTTP_relay_server_assigning_unit <highlight><bold>9200</bold></highlight> specifies the candidate HTTP relay server to be used for the communication process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if the number of telephone sets connected to the telephone equipment adapter increases dramatically, the HTTP_relay_server_load_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>9100</bold></highlight> prepares the plurality of HTTP relay servers, and monitors an appropriate number of HTTP relay server&apos;s load situation, and allocates the usable HTTP relay server. The communication process is dispersed, and the process load of the HTTP relay server is confined within it capacity, Therefore, even if many users make telephone calls so that communication process concentrate, the process continues and the communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 8 comprises the HTTP relay server and the internet connection apparatus where the HTTP communication process is possible, which includes the followings: the TCP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5700</bold></highlight>, the HTTP_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5800</bold></highlight>, the voice_data packet_encoding_unit <highlight><bold>5500</bold></highlight>, the voice_data_packet decoding_unit <highlight><bold>5600</bold></highlight>, the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight>, the voice_data_buffering_unit <highlight><bold>8100</bold></highlight>. The internet connection apparatus is placed as an arbitrary terminal on the internet not protected by the firewall. The voice data received by HTTP access via the IP network from one of the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter through the firewall that allows passage of HTTP data communication. The voice data transmission and reception process between two telephone sets protected by firewall is possible via the HTTP relay server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 8 comprises the HTTP telephone call <highlight><bold>7300</bold></highlight>. If the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects that the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by the firewall, upon making a telephone call from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter via the Internet, in order to report that a telephone call is being made to the communication destination is telephone equipment adapter, the HTTP telephone call <highlight><bold>7300</bold></highlight> transmits the telephone cal information by the HTTP access, and HTTP is accessed from the destination telephone equipment adapter which notifies that the telephone call is being made from arbitrary unit to the destination telephone equipment adaptel This way, the voice data on the HTTP relay server is received, and its reverse process which is transmission and reception process of the voice data is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, according to the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 8, if the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects that the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by the firewall, upon making a telephone call from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter via the Internet, in order to report that a telephone call is being made to the communication destination telephone equipment adapter, the HTTP polling unit <highlight><bold>7100</bold></highlight> checks the communication situation of various telephone stored in the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight>. As a result of checking, the HTTP relay server is receiving a call at appropriate time interval. At this point, the telephone equipment adapter call receiving side can make a telephone call via the HTTP relay server made possible by the HTTP access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, according to the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 8, if the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects that the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by the firewall, upon making a telephone call from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter via the Internet, in order to report that a telephone call is being made to the communication destination telephone equipment adapter, the telephone_call_communication_unit <highlight><bold>7200</bold></highlight> transmits telephone cal using communication method such as mail message or instant message that passes through the firewall, so that the call receiving side telephone equipment adapter can make a telephone call via the HTTP relay server made possible by the HTTP access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, according to the internet telephone network system of Embodiment 8, if the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects that the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by the firewall, upon making a telephone call from a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter via the Internet, in order to report that a telephone call is being made to the communication destination telephone equipment adapter, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> only transmits the telephone call information via a temporary PSTN line, and the call receiving side telephone equipment adapter can make a telephone call via the HTTP relay server made possible by the HTTP access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 8 comprises the HTTP_connection_changing_unit <highlight><bold>8300</bold></highlight>. A telephone call is made from the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter via the Internet. The communication process is ready both telephone equipment adapters are connected by the HTTP relay server. At this point, the HTTP_connection_changing_unit <highlight><bold>8300</bold></highlight> changes the HTTP connection between the both telephone equipment adapters and the HTTP relay server, and creates a HTTP connection directly between both telephone equipment adapters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 8 comprises the TCP/IP_packet_header_alteration_unit <highlight><bold>8400</bold></highlight>. A telephone call is made from the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter via the Internet. The communication process is ready when the HTTP relay server connects both telephone equipment adapters. At this point, the TCP/IP_packet_header_alteration_unit <highlight><bold>8400</bold></highlight> alters the IP address of IP header unit and a port number of the TCP header contained in the voice data packets transferred from both telephone equipment adapters to the HTIP relay server. They are altered to the IP address and port number of the final transmission destination of the telephone equipment adapter. The processing speed via the HTTP relay server for carrying out the voice data communication between both telephone equipment adapter is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 8 comprises the HTTP_relay_server_load_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>9100</bold></highlight> and the HTTP_relay_server_assigning_unit <highlight><bold>9200</bold></highlight>. When the number of telephone sets connected to the telephone equipment adapter for performing HTTP access to the HTTP relay server increases extremely, then the HTTP_relay_server_load_monitoring_unit <highlight><bold>9100</bold></highlight> monitors the load situation by preparing a plurality of HTTP relay server. This way, the HTTP relay server process load is contained within the limit of its performance. The HTTP_relay_server_assigning_unit <highlight><bold>9200</bold></highlight> specifies the HTTP relay server used in the communication process by inquiry from the first telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 9 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 9, the telephone equipment adapters connected to the telephone sets mutually transmit their terminal names to one another upon disconnecting the communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows a configuration of the telephone equipment adapter of Embodiment 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> denotes a IP_address_information_message_transmitting/receiving_unit for exchanging messages between the telephone equipment adapters by using SMTP protocol, regarding the IP address information. The IP_address_information_message_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is also referred to as IP address information message processing unit. In addition to that, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> has a function to transmits the terminal name to the telephone equipment adapter connected to a telephone set. In addition to that, the address translation table is a table for storing the telephone number and terminal name by mapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> In the recent years, inside the company, in order to cut down on the IP address, there are many cases in which the IP address is dynamically allocated to DHCP (which stands for Dynamic Host Configulation Protocol) server or router. In addition to that, in the dial up configuration, there are cases in which the IP addresses are allocated dynamically. In this case, in order to specify the destination telephone equipment adapter upon calling, the terminal name is used to recognize the telephone equipment adapter instead of the IP address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> By mutually transmitting and receiving the IP addresses to the communication destination by using the mail protocol by specifying the terminal name upon calling, it becomes possible to specify the IP address for the later communication process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 2, the IP address of the communication destination telephone equipment adapter connected to a telephone set is obtained upon disconnecting the communication by using the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> which is included in the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Its own IP address is notified to the destination telephone equipment adapter from its telephone equipment adapter. In the Embodiment 9, the terminal names attached to the telephone equipment adapters are mutually exchanged by the IP_address_information_message_transmitting/receiving_units <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> instead of exchanging the IP addresses upon disconnection. The received terminal name is mapped to the telephone number and stored in the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. When making a telephone call to the destination telephone set after receiving the terminal name, since the IP address is being allocated and mapped to the terminal name, the telephone call can be made via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The internet telephone network system of Embodiment 9, a telephone call is made to a telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter from another telephone set connected to the same kind of telephone equipment adapter by inputting a telephone number of conventional general PSTN line. The telephone call is made via the PSTN line, the IP_address_learning_units <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> mutually transmit the terminal names upon disconnection. The address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> learns and stores the terminal name and telephone number of the typical conventional PSTN line. The IP_address_information_message_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> exchanges the IP address information message between the telephone equipment adapters by using protocol such as SMTP (which stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This way, the next telephone call is automatically made via the IP network. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>5002</bold></highlight> denotes a serial_port_communication_processing_unit for performing the communication process via the IP network on the dialup connection by protocol such as PPP via a typical PSTN line by connecting a typical terminal adapter to the serial port such as RS232C. The telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the serial port cable <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> of Embodiment 2 for the description of other reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> The internet telephone network system of the Embodiment 11 comprises the serial_port_communication_processing_unit <highlight><bold>5002</bold></highlight> for performing the communication process via the IP network by connecting a typical terminal adapter which can perform dialup connection using protocol such as PPP via the PSTN line to the serial port such as RS232C.

<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 12 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> According to the previously described Embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, the communication device such as telephone set outputs the communication information inputted to the telephone equipment adapter. However, the communication device is not limited to the telephone set only, but a personal computer or cellular phone may be adapted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 13 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> As already described in the Embodiment 2, in both cases of making a telephone call and receiving a telephone call, the telephone equipment adapter learns the communication destination&apos;s IP address. It is most likely that the calling side will make the telephone call again to the same destination. However, if receiving a telephone call, the likelihood of making a telephone call to the calling side is not necessary high. Such examples includes a salesman making a telephone call or making a telephone call inquiring for a specific information. In these cases, the call receiving side does not make a call back to the call making side. If so many of such calls are being made, the entries of the address translation table <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be over-written due to storing the IP addresses of the undesired destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Henceforth, the address translation table of the telephone equipment adapter receiving many such calls is set so that the such undesired destination IP address is not learned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the process method of not learning the IP address is adapted when receiving too many such telephone calls. However, it would be convenient for if the user if she can change the set up of this process method of not learning the IP address. The telephone equipment adapter is set so that the user can make selection of learning the destination IP address if received a telephone call. Using the previously described maintenance function does this. Alternatively, if the user is making a telephone call, the user can input an address learning prevention information by using the dial or push phone, which instructs not to learn the IP address. The address learning prevention information is input before or after inputting the telephone number. The address learning prevention information is previously set to the pre-determined dial or predetermined push button telephone set. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> detects the address learning prevention information and notifies to the IP_address_learning_unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> not to learn the IP address. Accordingly, the IP address of the communication destination is not learned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> The Embodiment 2 described one example of the internet telephone network systems comprising the PSTN_line_signal_processing_unit for learning address information from both call making side and call receiving side. The Embodiment 13 describes one example of the internet telephone network systems comprising the PSTN_line_signal_processing_unit for not learning address information of the call making side at the call receiving side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, it is also possible to construct the internet telephone network system where a mode set up in the PSTN_line_signal_processing_unit is possible by enabling the user to select two modes. Mode one is to carry out the learning process of the IP address learning unit for learning the address information of the call making side and call receiving side. Mode two is to not carry out the learning process of the IP address learning unit for learning address information of communication of the call making side at the call receiving side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 14 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> In the Embodiment 14, the system of mutually exchanging the IP address after finishing the communication as in the Embodiment 2 is further described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> outlines a configuration of two users communicating by using telephone sets and telephone equipment adapters of the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> denotes a telephone_line_interface_control_circuit, which tentatively combines the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the line_connection_switching_unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the designation identifying unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> After finishing the communication, a user puts the receiver back to the telephone set after an appropriate time elapses. This receiver&apos;s situation is in general called on-hook. In contrast to that, a situation of the receiver being picked up is called off-hook. If the on-hook situation is transmitted to the exchanger of the PSTN line as it is, the exchanger disconnects the communication line so that the IP address information cannot be exchanged. The PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> of the telephone equipment adapter detects the on-hook situation of the telephone set, and the telephone line_interface_control_circuit <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> switches the PSTN circuit for indicating that the of-hook situation of the telephone set is indicated. In other words, the telephone set itself at this point is separate from the PSTN line, and the telephone equipment adapter is directly connected to the PSTN line instead of the telephone set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, even after the user puts the receiver back to finish the communication, the connection is held on for transmitting and receiving the IP address information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Immediately after two users finish the communication and on-hook the receivers, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit maintains the connection on the PSTN line and transmits an address information corresponding to the identification information. The address information of the telephone set of the communication information transmitting side is transmitted to the destination of transmitting the communication information telephone set via the PSTN line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> shows one example of sequential procedure of transmitting and receiving the IP address information. In this example, a telephone set A makes a call to a telephone set B. The sequence is indicated from (1) to (9). The telephone set B which receives a call transmits a disconnect tone which is going to be an indicator for a start of the first process (1). At a point of transmitting the disconnect tone which is the first indicator, the users at both telephone sets must on-hook the receiver. After finishing communication, a sufficient amount of time needed to put the receiver back by the user, for example, wait for about 5 seconds and then the first disconnect tone is transmitted. By doing so, the transmitting and receiving of the IP address will be successful mostly. If the disconnect tone is transmitted while the telephone set A is still in on-hook situation, the process will fail, therefore, the IP address is transmitted and received from the next call onwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Immediately after one of the users finishes the communication and on-hook the receiver, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit maintains the connection on the PSTN line after waiting for a sufficient amount of time needed to on-hook the receiver by the other user, and transmits an address information corresponding to the identification information of the telephone set from the communication information transmitting side to the destination of transmitting the communication information via the PSTN line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, after finishing communication, a busy tone (which is a tone indicating communication in progress mode) is transmitted to the communication destination telephone set from the telephone equipment adapter connected to it when the telephone set is on-hooked. This is done so that the on-hook operation of the receiver will be in time for the start of the IP address transmission and reception process after finishing communication. The users in general are accustomed to putting back the receiver if s/he hears a busy tone rather than not hearing any sound at all. Alternatively, it may be effective to use a high note alarm tone instead of the busy tone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Immediately after two users on-hook the receiver to finish the communication, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit transmit a tone such as a busy tone from the telephone equipment adapter of the other user to the telephone set, so that the other user still hanging onto the receiver will know that the communication is finished and on-hooks the receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, while the IP address transmission and reception process are in progress, immediate use of the telephone set straight after finishing the communication is not possible. As the telephone equipment adapter process, if the IP address transmission and reception process starts, the connection is not switched to the PSTN line to the telephone set side until the process completely finishes. In order to notify the user of such situation, the user is notified by using a busy tone to alarm them that the communication cannot be used while the IP address transmission and reception processes are in progress. If the off-hook operation of the receiver of the telephone set is detected during the IP address transmission and reception process, the busy tone is transmitted to the telephone set side. As described before, a high note alarm tone may be transmitted instead of the busy tone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Immediately after one of the users finishes the communication and on-hook the receiver, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit maintains the connection on the PSTN line, and while an IP address corresponding to the identification information of the telephone set is transmitted from the communication information transmitting side to the destination for transmitting the communication information via the PSTN line, if either one of the users off-hooks the receiver again to use the telephone set, this user is alarmed that the transmission process is still in progress that the telephone cannot be used yet. Transmitting a busy tone from the telephone equipment adapter of the user to the telephone set alarms the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> In the above example, the telephone cannot be used while the IP address transmission and reception processes are in progress. However, the telephone equipment adapter is capable of accepting the telephone number input from the telephone set. Instead of sending the busy tone, the telephone number input is accepted in a normal manner, and the telephone identification information of the telephone number is stored, and after finishing the IP address transmission and reception process, the telephone call is made as usual. Since the IP address transmission and reception process does not take too much time, and it is very likely that the process would be complete while the user is inputting the telephone numbel By doing so, the user can make another telephone call immediately after finishing the communication, without having to wait for the completion of the IP address transmission and reception process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Immediately after one of the users finishes the communication and on-hook the receiver, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit maintains the connection on the PSTN line, and while an IP address corresponding to the identification information of the telephone set is transmitted from the communication information transmitting side to the destination for transmitting the communication information via the PSTN line, if either one of the users off-hooks the receiver again to use the telephone set, the identification information of the destination telephone set input by the user is accepted and stored, and after the completion of the IP address transmission and reception process, the communication process using the inputted identification information starts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> The registration process of registering the IP address to the IP address table is so far described. Next, we shall describe the method of erasing the registered destination IP address to suit the convenience of the users. We have already discussed the necessity of not registering the destination IP address in the Embodiment 13. Under these circumstances, set up is made so that the IP address is not registered autonomously. After a specific communication, if a user thinks that future communication with this destination is not likely, such as a claim call, a wrong numbered call, an inquiry call, or a questionnaire call etc, then immediately after the communication, the IP address registration is cancelled. In order to implement this function, after the IP address transmission and reception processes, the user picks up the receiver, and inputs a number indicating the registration erasing function along with a specific symbols such as sharp &ldquo;&num;&rdquo; and asterisk &ldquo;*&rdquo; (erase instruction information). Based on this operation, the PSTN_line_signal_transmitting/receiving_unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> inside the telephone equipment is adapter erases the IP address entry that is just stored via the telephone_number/IP_address_translation_unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The user can erase the unnecessary destination IP address registration accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. After finishing communication by the user, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit can erase the IP address information registration of the destination telephone set acquired from the IP address learning unit in such cases as an apparent wrong telephone number call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 15 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> In the previously described Embodiment 2, an input of telephone number is confirmed as shown in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the Embodiment 15, the content of that process shall be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> The telephone number is an identification information of the telephone set. There are various digits available in the telephone numbeL There are several different ways as to decide whether the input of telephone number by user is finished or not. Basically, an appropriate time interval between inputting one digit of the telephone number and the next digit one would be, for example, 0.3 seconds. It is very unlikely that this time interval to exceed 5 seconds. Therefore, if there is no more input operation taking place from the user after a certain set up time exceeded, then the input of the telephone number by the user is determined as finished. This time interval depends on the habit of the user&apos;s telephone number inputting operation; therefore, the user ideally sets up an appropriate time interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit detects the situation of no input of word by word successive information after a specific time elapse and decides that the input of identification number by the user from the destination telephone set is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> In the above example, the waiting time until the input is finished is set to 5 seconds. Some users may not like this waiting time. Henceforth, such users may adapt a method of inputting a pre-determined information after finishing the input of the last digit of the telephone number for notifying the input completion to the telephone equipment adapter. The pre-determined information is configured by words such as sharp &ldquo;&num;&rdquo; and asterisk &ldquo;*&rdquo;. This is input as finishing information. Of course, together with the method of inputting the finishing information, an automatic decision after set time is also possible. On the other hand, as for the internal telephone inside a company where the digit size of telephone number is fixed to 4 digits, the completion of telephone number input is automatically decided by inputting &ldquo;9&rdquo; before inputting the telephone number which notifies that it is internal telephone number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> This fact is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit detects the situation of no input of word by word successive information after a specific time elapse and decides that detecting the specific word input last finishes the input of identification number of the destination telephone set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> Further, in regard to the telephone numbering system, the communication enterprise information is determined for each communication enterprise (telephone service company). Such communication enterprise information (for example, 090 for cellular phones) input can be used to implement the method of confirming the following telephone number digits (that is, the size of the telephone number). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The user inputs the identification information of the destination telephone set. The PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit decides the input completion and confirms the input of the upper identification information (communication enterprise information) for specifying the telephone company. The digit number (size) of the identification information is determined based on the upper identification information of the numbering system of various telephone companies. By counting the number of words being inputted, the completion of input is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, the upper identification number for various telephone companies is described. The company name of the telephone company is abbreviated. upper identification information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> In using the communication enterprise other than NTT from the NTT subscribed telephone, the first 3 to 4 digits is dialed. After the spring of 2001, the &ldquo;telephone priority connection system&rdquo; is endorsed. This is a communication without having to dial the 3 to 4 digits identification number by previously registering the communication enterprise for the everyday use. Accompanied by the reorganization of the NTT, both NTT East Japan and NTT West Japan were granted with this identification number from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication in August 1999. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> shows the upper identification information for various telephone services companies (communication enterprises). However, the names of telephone service companies (communication enterprise) mentioned in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> are abbreviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, after step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> for the Embodiment 4, according to the inputted telephone number, the address translation table is being referred in step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. is This referring process may be executed after completing the input of all the telephone number information. Alternatively, the referring process can take the method of narrowing down the candidates of the IP address table entries digit by digit every time one digit of the telephone number is input from the top. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Every time 1 word of the identification information is input from the destination telephone set after having determined the completion of input from the telephone set, the designation identifying unit maintains the translating process by the address translation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> As described previously, when the IP address table entries are being searched for 1 digit input of the telephone number, even before commencing the entry searching by using all the digits, there are cases when only 1 address information candidate is remaining. Under such circumstances, when come to a point of no more address information candidate available, the IP address translation process finishes. This way, the process is implemented rapidly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Every time 1 word of the identification information is input from the destination telephone set after having determined the completion of input from the telephone set, the designation identifying unit restricts those address information candidates that have possibility of translating by the translation process of the address translation unit. When the selection is narrow down to 1, that address information candidate is adapted as a final translated result without waiting for input of the whole identification information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, in confirming the telephone number per 1 digit by 1 digit entry, if the configuration is structured in such a way that the IP address table entry candidate cannot narrow down, then the whole digits of telephone number is used for the search. The intermediate situation of both cases, for example, if 8 digits telephone number is input; the IP address table entry is searched. This is based on the assumption that a search process may be a successful if 8 digits search result match, in advance reading search. There is much suitable number of digits for advance reading other than 8 digits. If making many internal calls using 4 digits internal telephone number, the search process is executed once after 4-digit input. In total, a rapid determining process is implemented. In addition to that, the advance reading of the search process, if a plurality of candidates is remaining, search is executed to the telephone number added again; an accurate search process is implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. Every time 1 word of the identification information is input from the destination telephone set after having determined the completion of input from the telephone set, the designation identifying unit restricts those address information candidates that have possibility of translating by the translation process of the address translation unit. When the selection is narrow down to 1 after the identification information is input by a specific number of digits, that address information candidate is adapted as a final translated result without waiting for input of the whole identification information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 16 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the process when the telephone equipment adapter is connected to the communication device managing device such as PBX or button type telephone device is described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> shows a plurality of telephone line connections in use by using a typical PBX or button type telephone device. When making a telephone call from a communication device (i.e., telephone set) to an outside area beyond the PBX <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, the communication process is no different from the case of direct connection of the pre-existing telephone set. The telephone number information inputted to the telephone set upon making a call is transmitted to the exchanger of the telephone center, and the exchanger creates a connection to the communication destination. On the other hand, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, if a telephone call is made from a telephone set outside of the PBX <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, there is a need for selecting a specific telephone set inside the PBX. Therefore, an exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> must transmits a lower digit information of the telephone number for identifying a plurality of telephone sets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>that are supported by the PBX. The transmission and reception method of information between the PBX <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is pre-arranged by the telephone company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> shows a plurality of telephone line connection in use by using a telephone managing device connected to the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> In order for the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to support the connection configuration with the telephone managing device such as PBX and button type telephone, if a telephone set from outside of the PBX <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is making a call. Then the lower digit information of the telephone number received from the exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> must be transmitted to the telephone managing device. This is being performed by the actual telephone managing device. The transmission and reception method between the telephone equipment adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the telephone managing device of PBX <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is identical to the method adapted between the exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and the PBX <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. In regard to the transmission and reception method of the lower digit information of this telephone number, various telephone companies disclose the detailed procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. When the telephone managing device such as PBX or button type telephone is connected in between the telephone sets, and if the telephone equipment adapter makes a telephone call via the IP network or the PSTN line, the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit of the telephone equipment adapter transmits an identification information for identifying a specific telephone set among from the plurality of telephone sets connected to the telephone managing device. This way, the telephone set for communication is specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> In addition to the transmission and reception processes taking place between an exchanger of the telephone company and a typical telephone set, in order to provide a special service using the device such as PBX, the transmission and reception processes are also available for implementing that service. Other than the support service by the PBX, there is a service related to the number display. This function displays the communication destination&apos;s telephone number to the display unit of the its own telephone set. The telephone number information is transmitted and received between the exchanger and the telephone set. Basically, the exchanger transmits the telephone number information to a telephone set of the call receiving side. In order to implement this concept to the internet telephone network system of the present invention, the telephone equipment adapter temporarily connected to the telephone set call receiving side accumulates the telephone number information transmitted from the exchanger, and transmits that telephone number information to the telephone set in the similar manner as the transmission and reception method to the exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. When the telephone equipment adapter has an arrangement for the number display function in regard to the communication service on the PSTN line, then the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit transmits the identification information for identifying the communication destination telephone set if a call is being made from the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network or the PSTN line. By doing so, the identification number of the communication destination is displayed in the display unit of the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> The service described above is a service of the exchanger on the PSTN line. In order to support and implement the same function also on the IP network, the telephone equipment adapter of the calling side can transmit its telephone number information to the telephone equipment adapter of the call receiving side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. When the telephone equipment adapter has an arrangement for the number display function in regard to the communication service on the PSTN line, then the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit transmits the identification information for identifying the communication destination telephone set if a call is being made from the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. By doing so, the identification number of the communication destination is displayed in the display unit of the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, in regard to the number display function, by inputting a special number digits at the head of the telephone number (non-notification information such as 184), the transmission of the telephone number information to the communication destination can be refused. The telephone equipment adapter of the call making side via the PSTN line need only input the telephone number including the special number digit to the exchanger as it is such that a special communication process is unnecessary. The call receiving side of the telephone equipment adapter must mediate the refusal communication process requiring the telephone number information between the exchanger and the telephone set. In addition to that, when making a call via the IP network, when the special number digit input is confirmed, the telephone number information is not transmitted to the telephone equipment adapter of call receiving side. In addition to that, the telephone equipment adapter of call receiving side must refuse the transmission of the telephone number information to the telephone equipment adapter in the similar manner as the communication process of the exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. When the telephone equipment adapter has an arrangement for the number display function in regard to the communication service on the PSTN line, then the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit transmits the identification information for identifying the communication destination telephone set if a call is being made from the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. If it did not attach the number digit for refusing the notification of the telephone number, by not transmitting it to the communication destination telephone equipment adapter, able to control the display of identification number of own telephone set to the display unit of the destination telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> As regard to the services of the number display function, communication process method procedures between the exchanger of telephone company and the telephone are disclosed. In accordance to that procedure, the number display function is implemented to the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 17 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> According to the maintenance set up function described in the Embodiment 4, the user can set up a particular control information to the configuration data storing unit. If there is an error in that set up, the telephone equipment adapter cannot operate properly. For example, if a net mask or the IP address of the telephone equipment adapter is wrong, then all the processes of accessing to the IP network will fail. Therefore, if an apparent error in the set up value for executing the process of telephone equipment adapter is detected, the user is notified of the error in that set up value. Example of the notification includes: displaying of alarm display lamp or display screen to the telephone equipment adapter; and transmitting an alarm tone indicating error in the set up when the user picks up the receiver upon using the communication device connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> This fact is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. When a user sets up the telephone equipment adapter by using the IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit or the telephone_input_data_writing_unit, and if an error is detected in that set up upon executing the whole communication processes so that the communication process cannot be executed properly, then the IP_network_communication_processing_unit or the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit display alarm to the display unit of the telephone equipment adapter or transmit an alarm noise to the connected telephone set, and guides the user to correct the mistake in that set up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> In the internet telephone network system described above, a wrong set up of the IP address is given as an example. However, as regard to the IP network access, the user is alarmed in the similar manner if the IP network access is not executed due to other causes such as a failure in the connected router or cut-off in the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> In the internet telephone network system described above, when a user sets up the telephone equipment adapter by using the IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit or the telephone_input_data_writing_unit, and if an error is detected in that set up upon executing the whole communication process but still the communication procesess are executed, but if the IP network or the PSTN line connected to the telephone equipment adapter is cut-off or the IP network device is broken or not operating, then the IP_network_communication_processing_unit or the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit display alarm to the display unit of the telephone equipment adapter or transmit an alarm noise to the connected telephone set, and notifies the user of the abnormality in the peripheral devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> Henceforth, in regard to the alarm function described above, if the broken router is restored, or if the IP network which was being cut-off is restored, a normal IP network access is re-started, therefore, by stopping the conventional alarm process and starting the normal process, the user does not have to go through the trouble of releasing the alarm function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> In the internet telephone network system described above, when a user the set telephone equipment adapter by using the IP_network_data_reading/writing_unit or the telephone_input_data_writing_unit, and if an error is detected in that set up upon executing the whole communication processes but still the communication process is executed, but if the IP network or the PSTN line connected to the telephone equipment adapter is cut-off or the IP network device is broken or not operating. If able to get out of that situation by the restoration process of peripheral devices, the user is notified of the restoration of abnormality in the peripheral devices by not transmitting the alarm noise to the connected telephone set or by stopping the alarm display by the display unit of the telephone equipment adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 18 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> In the previously described Embodiment 8, the POST message is described as a message to transmit the voice data to the HTTP relay server. Other than the POST message, others message such as GET and PUT messages may be used. However, the GET message must be incorporated into the field known as URL, therefore, it basically has a limit in the data size. The POST and PUT messages can carry the main data body as well as the various fields called headers, therefore, they basically have no limit in the data size. Exception is the restriction in the implementation of HTTP proxy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, in obtaining the voice data using the GET message from the HTTP relay server, the sliced voice data can repeatedly be obtained by issuing the GET message. Alternatively, the GET message obtains the second size data which is sufficiently larger than the first size voice data of communication time. The GET message only has to be issued once to obtain the voice data. At this point, it is possible to obtain the first size sliced voice data repeatedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> According to the HTTP method, the transmission and reception processes of the message are executed after the client side and the server side is connected. Basically, generation of this connection takes time, therefore, once the connection is established, in order to improve the performance of the voice data transmission and reception processes in real time, it would be ideal to keep that connection as much as possible. However, in most of the cases, there are network node such as HTTP proxy existing in between the client side and the server side, therefore, depending on the relay situation, the connection may be disconnected without concerning the conveniences of the client side and the server side. Under such circumstances, establishing a new connection restarts the voice data transmission and reception processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> In addition to the HTTP method, the communication on the IP network using the TCP is being conducted at the telephone equipment adapter and the HTTP relay server. The TCP is a connection type communication protocol. The connection must be established before transmitting and receiving data. When using the communication process by this TCP, for some reason on the IP network, if a data is still held for a long period of time, or if the connection is disconnected, the program process is stopped. The following measures are taken to avoid the system hangout. A certain timeout value is set to all the data transmission and reception processes. If there is no response from the communication destination and if the timeout value is exceeded during the reply waiting process from the destination, then the connection is newly established. The IP network access process is re-started from the beginning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> This is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The telephone equipment adapter connects to the HTTP communication processing unit of the relay server for transmitting the voice data packet. After connection, the voice data is stored in the GET, POST, PUT messages in the encode format for transmission. The GET, POST, PUT messages are prescribed by the HTTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> This is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The telephone equipment adapter connects to the HTTP communication processing unit of the relay server for receiving the voice data packet. After connection, the voice data is stored in the GET method reply message in the encode format for reception. The GET method message is prescribed by the HTTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> This is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The telephone equipment adapter connects to the HTTP communication processing unit of the relay server for receiving the voice data packet. After connection, data size larger than the size of voice transmission reception data such as in telephone conversation is obtained by the GET method message prescribed by HTTP, and the voice data is stored in the reply message data itself in an encode format. Every time the voice data is generated, that voice data is continuously received as segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> This is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The telephone equipment adapter connects to the HTTP communication processing unit of the relay server for transmitting and receiving the voice data packet. After connection, various method messages or their reply messages are transmitted and received, and after having done that the connection is not immediately disconnected but the connection is maintained to transmit and receive various method messages or their reply messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> This is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The telephone equipment adapter connects to the HTTP communication processing unit of the relay server for transmitting and receiving the voice data packet. After connection, while the various method messages and their replay messages are being transmitted and received, or immediately after being transmitted and received, if the connection is disconnected for one reason or the other, the connection is re-established, and the new connection is maintained to transmit and receive various method messages or their reply messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> This is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The telephone equipment adapter connects to the HTTP communication processing unit of the relay server for transmitting and receiving the voice data packet. After connection, while the various method messages and their replay messages are being transmitted and received, or immediately after being transmitted and received, if no response of the HTTP or TCP transmission and reception processes after a certain period of set time is elapsed, the connection is disconnected, and then re-connected, and the new connection is maintained to transmit and receive various method messages and their reply messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 19 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> According to the previously described Embodiment 8, the telephone_set_calling_information_managing_unit <highlight><bold>8200</bold></highlight> accesses the management area of the communication destination, and checks whether it is in the communication mode or not in step S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>). In the Embodiment 19, an identifier which is the communication connection identification information is given to the communication itself, (hereinafter the identifier shall be referred to as session ID), upon making a telephone call by using HTTP method, at a point of inquiring whether or not the telephone call can be made to the HTTP relay server, when the telephone call can be made, the HTTP relay server attaches the session ID to the communication, and confirms that the telephone call can be made. Basically, the session ID is created by the counter incrementally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> Based on this session ID, the HTTP relay server manages information related to the communication. The telephone equipment adapter of the user side obtains this session ID as a communication approval. This way, the voice data transmitted and received to the HTTP relay server is distinguished from the other communication while referring to the session ID. In the HTTP relay server, the following log information are recorded and managed: the session ID, the information related to communication such as identification information of communication device of both sides, the IP address information, duration of communication, communication starting time, and communication finishing time. Accounting is taken care of based on these management informations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> This is described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The relay server manages a session information that is a collection of address information of the telephone equipment adapters of both users as a communication connection identification information. The communication connection identification information is stored inside the voice data packet and is transmitted via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> This is also described in one example of the internet telephone network systems. The relay server manages session information that is a collection of address information of the telephone equipment adapters of both users as a communication connection identification information. Every time the communication takes place between the users, the communication duration, and the amount of communication packets are memorized and extracted as log information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 20 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> The Embodiment 20 describes the telephone equipment adapter having a process method of notifying the communication in progress mode to a third individual while the communication is taking place using the three methods of the communication via the PSTN line, the communication using UDP via the IP network, and the communication using HTTP via the IP network. The third individual is making a call using other method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> We have already explained the communication process where the three methods of PSTN line, UDP and HTTP coexists in the Embodiment 6. In addition to that, the procedure of making a telephone call using the method of HTTP is described in the Embodiment 8. In the Embodiment 20, as the procedure of making this telephone call, the telephone calling method using SMTP mail (which stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> While communication is taking place using the three methods mentioned above, when there is an incoming call from a third individual, there are 9 different patterns as shown in the drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43, a</cross-reference> basic process of notifying the communication in progress mode is outputting a busy tone to the telephone set of the third individual. If the incoming call from the third individual is via the PSTN line, then other than transmitting a busy tone directly from the exchanger of the telephone company, the telephone equipment adapter in which the call is being made to creates the busy tone and transmit it via the PSTN line. However, in the latter case, such a simple notification of communication in progress mode involves the payment of telephone bill to the telephone company since it enters the communication mode. If the telephone call is made using UDP from the third individual, the telephone equipment adapter which the call is being made to reports the communication in progress mode such that the telephone equipment adapter itself of the third individual creates the busy tone which can be heard by the user. As for the telephone call is made using HTTP from the third individual, if detected the communication in progress mode by inquiring to the HTTP relay server, the telephone equipment adapter of the third individual itself creates the busy tone so that it can be heard by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> Based on these methods, even if three kinds of telephone communication methods coexist, it is still possible to report communication in progress mode to the telephone call made from the third individual. However, in order to simplify the internal design of the telephone equipment adapter, it is possible to skip reporting of the communication in progress mode. In this case, even if the third individual makes a telephone call, she may perceive that the destination does not answer the telephone for a very long time, such that this may be perceived strange as compared to the preexisting telephone being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> This fact explains one example of the internet telephone network systems that adapts the PSTN line communication, the RTP communication process, and the HTTP communication process. When a third user makes a telephone call using either one of the three communication methods mentioned above while the communication is taking place using either one of the three methods mentioned above. The IP_network_communication_processing_unit or the PSTN_line_communication_processing_unit transmits a busy tone to the telephone set of the third user and notifies the communication in progress mode. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the above embodiments which described one example of the internet telephone network system of the present invention have the following effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> A telephone call is made via the IP network when communication via the IP network is possible. The telephone call is made via the PSTN line when communication via the IP network is not possible. The communication via the IP network is not possible at the following circumstances. The telephone number cannot be converted to IP address. The destination telephone equipment is not connected to the IP network. A telephone equipment adapter connected to the destination telephone set is not interchangeable to the telephone equipment adapter of call making side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the conventional telephone number can be used as it is to make a telephone call via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, if the incoming communication information from the IP network is received as a digital voice data, it is transmitted to the telephone equipment as an analog voice data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, if the outgoing communication information from the telephone equipment is received as an analog voice data, it is converted to a digital voice data and transmitted to the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, if the destination telephone set can transmit or receive the outgoing or incoming communication information via the IP network, and then the telephone call is made via the IP network. Otherwise, if not possible via the IP network, the telephone call is made via the PSTN line. Connections are automatically switched. Responding to the needs, the user can transmit and receive the outgoing and incoming communication information via the IP network or via the PSTN line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, a telephone number of the telephone set and an IP address mapped to the telephone number are notified to the destination telephone number after finishing the communication via the PSTN line. The user doesn&apos;t have to look up for the IP address of the destination. The user doesn&apos;t need to set it up in the address translation table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone number of conventional general PSTN line and the IP address are mapped and memorized. This way, the telephone call is automatically made via the IP network from the next call onwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, more than two voices other than your own one received from the other telephone sets connected to the telephone equipment adapter of the present invention via the IP network are mixed, and the mixed voices are output. The tele-conference among more than three individuals via the IP network is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the tele-conference identification number is set to the tele-conference. The user requesting to join the tele-conference must indicate this tele-conference identification number. This way, the tele-conference is carried out among the specified telephone sets via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone identification number is set to the telephone equipment connected to the telephone equipment adapter. The user requesting to join the tele-conference must indicate this telephone identification number. This way, the tele-conference is carried out among the specified telephone equipment via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the password is previously allocated to each user who is going to participate in the tele-conference. The passwords are managed for each tele-conference. The user inputs the password upon participating to the tele-conference. This way, the inputted password is compared and referred to the previously registered passwords. The participation to the tele-conference is therefore verified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, a control information is input from the existing telephone set or a general-purpose personal computer connected to the telephone equipment adapter for carrying out the maintenance operations. The configuration data stored in the configuration_data_storing_unit is changed according to the inputted control information. An extra cost incurred in attaching the I/O data device to the telephone equipment adapter, especially used for the maintenance operation, is deduced. In addition to that, the user utilizes the conventional devices (such as existing telephone set or the general-purpose personal computer) to simply carry out the maintenance operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the permission information related to the tele-conference is input from the personal computer connected to the IP network or from the telephone set connected to the telephone equipment adapter, and is registered. Registration changes and deletions are easily carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, UDP and RTP are used having an excellent real-time property in the communication process. The communication voice quality is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the firewall that does not allow the use of arbitrary UDP port is set so that the firewall can use a limited and specific UDP port. That specific UDP port number is stored in the telephone equipment adapter. The voice data communication processing beyond the firewall is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, in complying with the firewall that does not allow the use of arbitrary UDP port, a usable UDP port is scanned. The unknown usable UDP port is searched. The voice data communication processing is possible after finding the usable UDP port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, most firewall cannot use the UDP port; however, the HTTP port is normally open. The voice data is transmitted as HTTP message. This way, the communication process is implemented via the IP network despite of the firewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the voice data is transmitted and received by using TCP when a telephone call is made from the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the voice data is transmitted and received by using HTTP when a telephone call is made from the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the firewall plays a role of the security preventing the illegal access to the outside IP network from the IP network managed and connected to the telephone equipment adapter. The firewall is installed at the IP network boundary. In the case of making a telephone call by the telephone equipment adapter via the IP network, to comply with the firewall, an availability of HTTP port that can transmit and receive data is searched. The HTTP port that can transmit and receive data is specified. This HTTP port is used to carry out communication of the voice data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0456" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0456&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the header of the voice data packet for communication is individually compressed. This way, the voice data packet can be made smaller than the standard packet size. This reduces the network traffic. In addition to that, the compressed voice data packet can be decoded. The compressed packet information is received. This also reduces the network traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0457" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0457&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, even if there is a fluctuation in the transmission times of voice data packets for communication, the voice data packets are accumulated until they reach a certain size, and then they are transmitted to the analog regeneration side. The stable communication quality is maintained even if the network traffic condition is unstable. In addition to that, in order to transmit the digital voice data packet to the destination telephone set via the IP network, an outgoing digital voice data packet is created. The outgoing digital voice data packets are accumulated in the transmission buffer unit. The transmission buffer unit can change its buffer size. Before transmitting the accumulated digital voice data packets, the transmission buffer unit executes a process of adding only the necessary data to the compiled packets. This process is carried out by the transmission buffer unit. Reflecting on the network traffic conditions, the optimal digital voice data packet is transmitted. Good quality voice data is effectively transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, when each of voice data packets for communication is transmitted, a packet size is changed small size if the network traffic is small, large size if the network traffic is large. This way, the stable communication quality is maintained, and the network traffic does not receive an influence, even if the network traffic condition is not stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the redundant packet is issued when the packet loss of the outgoing voice data occurred. A stable communication quality is maintained even in the network traffic condition where the packet loss is frequent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, when there&apos;s too much network traffic to transmit the voice data packet, the voice data packets below a certain the level that does not influence the communication quality is not transmitted. This way, the stable communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the network traffic condition is estimated. Timings of receiving the voice data packets are measured. The receiving buffer size is adjusted. The redundant_packet_issuing_unit adjusts the number of replicating packet information. The packet_generation_filtering_unit adjusts a condition for deleting the number of outgoing packet information. At least one of the three adjusting is done. The optimal communication processing is implemented by responding to the updated network traffic. The stable communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the timings of receiving voice data packets are measured, and the measured results are accumulated so that it can be referred to as a data indicating network traffic condition at a day cycle or a weekly cycle. The optimal communication processing is controlled based on the averaged network traffic condition. The stable communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone equipment adapter can make a telephone call and can execute the communication processing via the HTTP relay server. The firewall can make access to the outside network by using HTTP. For this reason, there is no need to modify the setup of typical firewall to make a telephone call via the IP network. In addition to that, the voice data is temporarily stored in the HTTP relay server, and the telephone equipment adapter connected to other telephone set go and get that voice data. The effective communication processing is implemented. In addition to that, the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by the firewall. The HTTP polling unit of the HTTP relay server reports to the communication destination telephone equipment adapter that the telephone call is being made. This is done so by the HTTP polling unit of the HTTP relay server that periodically checks the communication situation of the telephone_set_call_information_managing_unit of the destination telephone equipment adapter. The communication mode of the telephone set is being stored in the telephone_set_call_information_managing_unit. At a point of detecting that the telephone call is being made, the destination telephone equipment adapter accesses the HTTP relay server by using HTTP. In addition to that, if the destination telephone equipment adapter is protected by the firewall, in order to report to the destination telephone equipment adapter that the telephone call is being made, the PSTN_signal_processing_unit transmits only the telephone call information temporarily via the PSTN line. Then, the telephone equipment adapters communicate via the HTTP relay server by HTTP access, and exchange the communication information via the HTTP relay server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the HTTP relay server negotiates the first connection between the telephone equipment adapters. After the first negotiation process, the HTTP_connection_changing_unit in the HTTP relay server changes the HTTP and TCP connection so that the connection between the telephone equipment adapters is direct. The communication data-are transmitted and received after the first negotiation process between the telephone equipment adapters. However, the process load is going to be a heavy burden. The communication data are better of transmitted and received directly between the telephone equipment adapters without bypassing the HTTP relay server. The process burden put on the HTTP relay server is lightened. Owing to this fact, even if the communication processes concentrate because many users are making telephone calls at one time, the processes can continue without being stagnant. The communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the communication data is transmitted and received directly between the telephone equipment adapters without bypassing the HTTP relay server For this reason, the process burden put on the HTTP relay server is lightened. Despite of the concentrated communication processes by many users making telephone calls, without being stagnant the process continues. The communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, as a process of the HTTP relay server, an IP address contained in the IP header of the voice data packet is directly converted to the IP address of the final transmission destination telephone equipment adapter. The TCP header port number contained in the IP header of the voice data packet is likewise directly converted to the port number of the destination telephone equipment adapter. Owing to this, the process burden put on the HTTP relay server is lightened. Despite of the concentrated communication processes by many users making telephone calls, without being stagnant the process continues. The communication quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, even though the HTTP relay server tries to carry out the communication process efficiently, if a number of telephone equipment adapters requesting for the communication process has increased accompanied by the increased number of users, since there is a performance limit that a single HTTP relay server possesses, it will fail at some point. Therefore, a plurality of HTTP relay servers is prepared. The HTTP_relay_server_managing_server for integrating and managing the plurality of HTTP relay servers is prepared. The HTTP_relay_server_managing_server finds the HTTP relay server having a small number of users and specifies the candidate HTTP relay server to be used for the communication process. A favorable communication is maintained for the various users by dispersing the communication processes of various telephone equipment adapters to the plurality of HTTP relay servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the name of telephone equipment adapter is used as an identifier of the telephone equipment adapter. The identifiers are seized between the telephone equipment adapters prior to transmitting and receiving the communication data. Because of this, the telephone equipment adapter can be adapted in a network configuration where the IP address is not fixed and is dynamically provided. The case in which the IP address is dynamically allocated is a learning of the IP address from the DHCP server. Another such case is when the IP address is allocated upon dial up connection from the telephone equipment adapter to the internet service provider (ISP). As in those cases when the fixed IP address is not allocated, the negotiation process for connecting from a telephone equipment adapter to its communication destination is effectively implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, instead of the network environment using the dedicated line connection to the IP network, the internet telephone can also be used by dial up connection. The dial up connection connects the IP network by dialing to the internet service provider (ISP). In other words, the user no longer needs to make contract for the dedicated line connection configuration to use the internet telephone at home. Using the dial up connection easily uses the internet telephone at home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, instead of the network environment using the dedicated line connection to the IP network, the internet telephone can also be used by dial up connection. The dial up connection connects to the IP network by dialing to the internet service provider (ISP). The terminal adapter used by the personal computer is used as a device to carry out this dial up connection. The modem, etc. is built in the terminal adapter. The modem is for communicating to the PSTN and ISDN. Serial port RS232C is attached to the telephone equipment adapter. This process device is easily implemented. A comparably costly device is entrusted to the terminal adapter side. The actual cost incurred in the telephone equipment adapter is deduced this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the telephone equipment adapter keeps the PSTN line connection even after both users put the receivers back upon finishing communication to allow for the exchange of the IP address information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, when the communication is finished and the communication information transmitting side puts the receiver back, a tone signal notifies the disconnection to the destination of transmitting the communication information. The tone signal is generated after a pre-determined time. This way, after finishing the communication and both receivers are put back, the telephone equipment adapter holds on the PSTN connection, and the IP addresses are definitely exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, a sound such as busy tone is generated for notifying the communication completion to the destination of transmitting the communication information. This way, the destination user will definitely know that the communication is finished. Then, the user puts the receiver back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, when a user tries to use the telephone set again while the IP addresses are still in the process of being exchanged, the user hears a busy tone at the receiver. The telephone set cannot be used while the IP addresses are being exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, when a user tries to use the telephone set again while the IP addresses are still in the process of being exchanged, the identification information of the destination input by the user is accepted. After the IP address information exchange process is finished, the accepted destination identification information is connected. The IP address exchange process does not take so much minutes times such that the user trying to make a telephone call does not have to wait to re-use the telephone set. This is convenient for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the identification information input is determined as complete after a certain time period of no input. This way, the user can omit inputting of information that indicates input completion of the identification information. This is convenient for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the identification information input is determined as complete by inputting a specific information. This way, the input completion is definitely determined. The identification information is accurately input. </paragraph>

This way, the identification information is converted to IP address at a speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0482" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0482&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, if the number of word information comprising the identification information inputted exceeds a pre-determined number, the address translation unit converts that word information to IP address information. This way, without having to wait for the whole input of the identification information, the information is translated to IP address such that process can be carried out at a speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0483" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0483&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the learning process by the IP_address_learning_unit is executed at both telephone sets of the call making side and receiving side. This way, the identification information and IP address are automatically learned. The internet telephone network system highly convenient is supplied to the users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0484" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0484&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the learning process by the IP_address_learning_unit may not executed when receiving a telephone call. This way, when a salesman makes a telephone call to the customers, the identification information and ID address of the call making side is not registered. This prevents from unnecessary use of memory area of the address translation table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0485" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0485&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, when the telephone call is being made by the telephone making side, the telephone making side can cease the learning process in the IP_address_learning_unit in the destination telephone equipment adapter. Since the telephone making side can conveniently cease the learning process of the destination, such that the internet telephone network system convenient for the user is supplied. </paragraph>
