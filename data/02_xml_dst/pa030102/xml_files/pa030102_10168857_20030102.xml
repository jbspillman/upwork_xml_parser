<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for placing spacer sticks (also known as dunnage) on a board stack and comprising a feeder device For the individual feeding of spacer sticks, the feeder device being placed in association with one short end of the stack, and a conveyor device located over the stack for conveying spacer sticks from the feeder device to positions over the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a method for placing spacer sticks on a board stack, comprising the steps that the spacer sticks are discharged individually from a feeder device to a conveyor device, that the spacer sticks arc carried by at least one carrier device located beneath the spacer sticks along a path over the stack and that the spacer sticks, when they are brought to positions substantially straight above their intended positions on the stack, are transferred to them. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the stacking of boards, a whole layer of boards is laid on the top of a board stack which is under construction by means of an off-loader which moves transversely of the longitudinal direction of the boards to a position in over the board stack. There, the layer of boards is off-loaded on subjacent spacer sticks whose longitudinal directions are transversely directed in relation to the longitudinal direction of the boards. Thus, the off-loader is placed along one longitudinal side of the board stack which is being constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The board stack which is being built up is placed on a vertically adjustable substrate which is gradually lowered as the height of the board stack increases so that the level of the uppermost layer in the board stack is thereby throughout substantially unchanged </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For placing spacer sticks on the upper side of a recently off-loaded layer of boards, use is normally made of two chains which run in over the stack and in its longitudinal direction, and in parallel with one another, and at such a height over the stack that the off-loader can pass under them for off-loading a layer of boards. The chains have hooks which, on the lower parts of the chains, are rearwardly open in the direction of travel. The chains are employed for conveying spacer sticks from a feeder device to positions over the stack. By the employment of vertically movable abutments, the spacer sticks are caused to release from the hooks and fall down on the upper side of the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A spacer stick layer device of this type comprises a considerable quantity of complex mechanical machinery. The distances between adjacent spacer sticks cannot readily be changed, and nor can spacer sticks of varying dimensions be handled. Finally, the work rate is too low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For laying out spacer sticks, an apparatus is flirter known in the art by means of which the spacer sticks are placed out on a substrate on the opposite side of the board stack in relation to the off-loader and from thence are lifted and displaced by means of suitable gripping members in over the board stack where the spacer sticks are lowered and deposited on the board stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An apparatus of this type operates slowly because of the long transport distances which are required on laying out the spacer sticks. Further, it is difficult to get at the finished stack, since it is surrounded by machinery. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PROBLEM STRUCTURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention has for its object to design the apparatus and the method intimated by way of introduction such that at least the one longitudinal side of a board stack can be kept wholly fee of machinery so that the board stack is thereby readily accessible. Further, the present invention has for its object to design the apparatus such that this may work at a very high work rate and with good operational reliability, and also permit convenient modification of the number, mutual spacing and dimensions of the spacer sticks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SOLUTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The objects forming the basis of the present invention will be attained regarding the apparatus if this is characterized in that at least parts of the conveyor device located beneath the spacer sticks are disposed to be movable in the lateral direction from advancement positions over the stack to release positions outside the stack, whereby the spacer sticks may readily be transferred from their positions located over the stack to positions where they rest on the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the objects forming the basis of the present invention will be attained regarding the method if this is characterised in that the spacer sticks are moved along and in the longitudinal direction of the carrier device and, when they have reached their positions above the intended positions on the stack, are stopped and the carrier device is released from the spacer sticks which are transferred to their intended positions.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The accompanying Drawings show only those components which directly carry out the laying-out of the spacer sticks on the upper side of the board stack Thus, the Drawings have omitted the beam frame which supports the above-mentioned components, as well as the guides and drive means required for their movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relates to a board stack which is in the process of being built up from boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are arranged in layers and a number of spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are located between the layers. The board stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rests on a substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is movable in the vertical direction and which is gradually lowered as the board stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is built up so that the uppermost layer of boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is kept at a substantially constant level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are displaced by layers in over the board stack by means of an off-loader (not shown) and are off-loaded on spacer sticks placed there. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this takes place from the right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In connection with the one short end of the board stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there is disposed a feeder device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> whose feeding direction is intimated by the arrow <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the spacer sticks being fed out individually and with their longitudinal direction horizontal and transversely directed in elation to the feeding direction <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In its most generic form, the present invention entails that there are disposed, in over the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and substantially parallel with its longitudinal direction, elongate carrier devices which are included in a conveyor device and which, with their one end, extend to the feeder device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and which, with their opposite end, extend at least so far along the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> where spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are to be placed. The carrier devices have no fixed positions for the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but these can be transported cared by and along the carrier devices in basically any optional number and with any optional spacing. The transport speed along the carrier devices for the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the same for all of the spacer sticks which are to lie in the same layer on the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but may otherwise be varied within broad limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Alternatives are also conceivable where only one carrier device is employed along either of the longitudinal sides of the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In order to prevent The end portions of the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> not carried by the carrier device from falling down on the stack, there is provided, over the stack, an elongate hold-down device, for example a belt or chain conveyor or slide rail so that the spacer sticks are fixedly clamped between the carrier device and the hold-down device when they are moved along the carrier device with their longitudinal direction transversely directed, preferably approximately at right angles, to the longitudinal direction of the carrier device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When the number of spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are to be located on the uppermost board layer of the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been transported along the carrier device/devices to positions straight above the positions they are to assume on the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the movement of all of the spacer sticks is arrested simultaneously, whereafter the spacer sticks are transferred downwards, preferably by force of gravity, to their final positions on the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one alternative, the vertical transfer of the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to their final positions on the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made possible in that the two carrier devices arc displaced horizontally sideways from the feeding/transport positions in over the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to release positions outside the stack, whereby the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can pass down between the carder devices. On the lateral movement of the carrier devices, the spacer sticks are held so that they cannot be displaced in their longitudinal direction (accompany either or both of the carrier devices). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the substantially horizontal lateral displacement of the carrier devices away from one another, it is also possible to turn the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> a certain angle in a substantially horizontal plane so that the opposite ends of the spacer sticks are free from the mutually facing edges of the carrier devices, whereafter the spacer sticks are lowered to a level below the carrier devices, they then being turned back through approximately the same angle before they are released down on the stack </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the alternative with only one earner device, the carrier device and the hold-down device are separated from one another in the vertical direction so that the ungripped ends of the spacer sticks rock down on the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this position, the spacer sticks are fixed in their longitudinal direction, whereafter the carrier device is laterally displaced to the release position so that the spacer sticks can fall completely down on the stack </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Concrete embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying Drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Above the board stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there is disposed a conveyor device with two conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which extend approximately parallel with the longitudinal sides of the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in over the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The conveyors serve the function of carrier devices and are suitably designed as belt conveyors where the conveyor belts have layers facing towards the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which, on the one hand, afford high friction against the spacer sticks and which, on the other hand, are somewhat resiliently yieldable so that the spacer sticks can be pressed slightly therein if the spacer sticks are pressed against the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a belt <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> running over two rollers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The conveyor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a corresponding construction. The two conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> tun with synchronous speed and can, therefore, receive spacer sticks discharged from the feeder device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the spacer sticks being transported with retained orientation in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> along the two conveyor The and surfaces of spacer sticks placed on the conveyors are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The distance between the spacer sticks resting on the conveyors may readily be modified by a modification of the relationship between the linear speed of advancement of the conveyors and the discharge rate of the individual spacer sticks out of the feeder device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The two conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are movably secured in a frame (not shown on the Drawings) for the apparatus according to the invention and are at least movable laterally in a substantially horizontal direction between the advancement positions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> and the release positions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In the advancement positions, the conveyors arc, as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, disposed in over the upper side of the stack and approximately along and slightly inside opposing edges of the stack. In the release positions, the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are located completely outside the stack seen in the lateral direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The transfer of the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between the advancement positions and the release positions and back may be realised by employing linear guides and piston and cylinder units, but may also be realised in that the conveyors are pendulum-suspended and are laterally moved in a pendulum motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown on the Drawings, the hold-down devices are designed as a third conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is placed parallel with and a slight distance above one of the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> when these are located in the advancement position. The third conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is movable in the vertical direction and, as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, displaceable into abutment against the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> resting on the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When the different conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are in the positions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the conveyor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is laterally displaced to the position according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the spacer sticks being fixedly clamped between the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that they freely hang out from these two conveyors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the third conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lifted back to the sting position, the spacer stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will rock and pivot so that its right-hand end in the Figures falls down on the uppermost layer of boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the board stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and rests on it In the last step of the deposition of the spacer sticks, the conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is laterally displaced to the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> so that the opposite ends of the spacer stacks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> also fall down on the upper side of the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> do not accompany the lateral displacement when the conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is moved, it is possible to provide, in the region at reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a longitudinal rail which has a smooth upper side and which extends along the entire length of the upper part of the conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is placed, in the vertical direction, in such a manner that, with the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> horizontal, it has a shore distance to the undersides of the spacer sticks while it abuts against and slightly lifts the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when the opposite ends of the spacer sticks have fallen or been pivoted down on the upper side of the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and both the conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are laterally displaced to the release position. In that the rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has slight friction against the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (which, on the other hand, is not the case for the belt of the conveyor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), the risk is reduced that the spacer sticks might possibly be entrained in the lateral movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In another alternative, the conveyor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also movable in the vertical direction so that, in the position according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it may be shifted in to its starting position and there be lowered so that it is applied against the lower ends of the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that these are clamped between the conveyor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the upper side of the board stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> On the infeed of the spacer sticks on the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it has been shown in the FIGS. that the third conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be located in its raised position. However, this is not necessary, but the conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be driven synchronously with the two other conveyors so that the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are thereby fixedly clamped between the conveyor belts in the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Hereby, the work rate will be substantially increased and, further, the risk will be avoided that the spacer sticks lose their positioning when the conveyors are stopped when the spacer sticks carried on the conveyors are located straight above their intended positions an the upper side of the stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is also possible to employ a fourth conveyor which corresponds to the third conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and which is placed over the conveyor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This fourth conveyor also improves the positioning of the spacer sticks by clamping the spacer sticks between itself and the subjacent conveyor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in connection with acceleration or retardation movements of the conveyors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> If a fourth conveyor is employed, its movement space in the vertical direction may be so great that it can be applied against the lower end of inclined spacer sticks according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> when the conveyor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is laterally displaced to its release position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The hold-down device need not be designed as the third conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or possibly the fourth conveyor, but may, in an alternative version, be in the form of an elongate rail which is movable in the vertical direction and placed analogous with the conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that it may be applied against the upper sides of the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> carried on the conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> when these arc located in positions according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Correspondingly, a vertically displaceable rail can replace the clamping function which may be allocated to the conveyor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the position according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a further alternative, the hold-down device nay be designed as elongate stop bars which are placed in connection with the end surfaces of the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in such vertical positions that the carrier devices can pass under them on the displacement from the advancement position to the release position, but be sufficiently low for them to be struck by the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> if these were to be displaced in the longitudinal direction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to form the hold-down device so that it can impart a limited longitudinal movement to the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As a result, in such embodiments where the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> rest on two carrier devices, e.g. the two conveyors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, one of these may be made fixed in the lateral direction since the spacer sticks instead are longitudinally displaced so far that their ends are free of this field carrier device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing, it has been described how the carrier devices are designed as conveyors on which the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> rest. An alternative carrier device is an elongate slide rail which, on its side facing towards the spacer sticks, has a coating consisting of a material of low friction in relation to the spacer sucks. For driving the spacer sticks along the slide rails, use is made of one or two conveyors (e.g. the conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> above) placed over the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and clamping the spacer sticks between itself and the subjacent slide rail. Both the slide rail and the co-operating conveyor may be movable in the vertical direction for releasing the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A construction in which the conveyors are placed undermost and thus function as carrier devices and in which the suede rails are placed uppermost is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing, it has been described how the spacer sticks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are cared by carrier devices in the form of slide rails or conveners <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at opposite end portions. However, it is also possible to employ a single career device which may be placed at one end of the spacer sucks or in the central region of the spacer sticks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the carrier device (conveyor or slide rail) is placed at end portions of the spacer sticks, it must be combined with a hold-down device (slide rail or conveyor, respectively) so that the operational conditions will be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the laying-out of the spacer sticks as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Fig. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When the carrier device is placed under the central region of the spacer sticks, the carrier device may be made so wide that a bold-down device may possibly be dispensed with. </paragraph>
