<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to scouring composition suitable for use in cleaning hard surfaces, especially rust stains from hard surfaces. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Scouring compositions such as those particulate compositions or liquid, gel, paste-type compositions containing abrasive components are well known in the art. Such compositions are used for cleaning hard surfaces, especially those surfaces that tend to become soiled with mineral deposits for example kitchen and/or bathroom surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Scouring compositions may also find use in removing metal stains from surfaces. More particularly, some scouring compositions are marketed as being capable of removing rust stains from surfaces. It has been noted by the Applicant, especially in less developed countries were poor water piping is still in existence, that metal oxidation products, for example, rust collects or deposits in the pipe and then flows with the water out of the water outlet pipe onto the surface in the home. The metal deposit collects on the surface leaving a sometimes coloured stain. Such metal-based stains are difficult to remove with general household hard surface cleaner and require specialist treatment with, for example a rust removing composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The Applicants have further found that although compositions containing abrasives go some way in removing the metal-based stain, such compositions can scratch or otherwise harm the surface to which it is applied. Thus it has been our objective to find a composition that is not only capable of removing metal stains, especially rust stains, but also does not scratch or otherwise harm the surface to which it is applied to the same extent as those commonly available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage of the present invention is that the composition also provides good cleaning performance. Moreover the compositions of the present invention also provide limescale and other mineral deposit removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Yet a further advantage of the compositions of the present invention is that they may be used on any hard surface. By &ldquo;hard-surfaces&rdquo;, it is meant herein any kind of surfaces typically found in houses like kitchens, bathrooms, or in car interiors or exteriors, e.g., floors, walls, tiles, windows, sinks, showers, shower plastified curtains, wash basins, WCs, dishes, fixtures and fittings and the like made of different materials like ceramic, vinyl, no-wax vinyl, linoleum, melamine, glass, any plastics, plastified wood, metal or any painted or varnished or sealed surface and the like. Hard-surfaces also include household appliances including, but not limited to, refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, automatic dryers, ovens, microwave ovens, dishwashers and so on. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a scouring composition comprising a C1-6 carboxylic acid and an abrasive particulate component having hardness from 2 to 4 as measured according to the MOHS hardness scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for manufacturing a composition as described in the preceding sentence. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a scouring composition comprising a C1-6 carboxylic acid and an abrasive particulate component having hardness from 2 to 4 as measured according to the MOHS hardness scale. By &ldquo;scouring composition&rdquo; it is meant a composition being in particulate, liquid or gel-type composition comprising an abrasive component. More preferably the composition is particulate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For reasons of storage stability and flow it is preferred that the level of water in the composition is limited to a level of less than 10%, more preferably less than 5%, most preferably less than 2% water in the composition. The pH of the composition on mixing with water is typically in the acidic range of pH less than 7, more preferably the pH is less than 4, even more preferably less than 2. According to the present invention pH is measured of a 25% dispersion of the composition in distilled water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention comprises a C1-6 carboxylic acid, meaning a carboxylic acid comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms as an essential feature thereof. Suitable acids may preferably be mono, but are preferably dicarboxylic acids. Suitable acids are selected form the group consisting of formic acid, sulphamic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, thioglycolic acid, thiomalic acid, oxalic acid and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The most preferred acid is oxalic acid since it is capable of providing rust removal by not only reducing the pH of the composition in water to a level where solubilisation of rust stains is improved, but also acts as a chelating agent for Fe<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> ions. Oxalic acid suitable for use herein can be in anhydrous form, dihydrate from, mixtures of the preceding forms and intermediate forms of the drying process from dihydrate to anhydrous (as described in Kirk-Othmer, 3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>Edition Vol 16, page 618.) and are also preferably in particulate form. The anhydrous form of oxalic acid is the most preferred in terms of performance and stability, even more preferred is the Alfa crystalline structure over the Beta structure. However the anhydrous form of oxalic acid is expensive and thus from a practical point of view the dihydrate form is preferred for use in the compositions of the present invention. Suitable oxalic acid dihydrate comprises less than 30% water, more preferably less than 15% water and even more preferably less than 10%water. The most preferred oxalic acid dihydrate for use herein comprises from 5-9% water. Although not wishing to be bound by theory it is thought preferable to limit the amount of water in the composition so as to prevent premature reaction of the oxalic acid and carbonate during storage. Oxalic acid dihydrate is available in particulate form from Allied Corporation, Rhone-Poulenc etc </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The oxalic acid is preferably present in the composition at a level of from 5% to 50%, more preferably from 5% to 30% and most preferably from 8% to 16%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Abrasive components typically used in the past include silica, silicate, shale ash, perlite and quartz sand. However the Applicants have found that such abrasives as known and typically used in the art, when used to clean hard surfaces, leave visible scratch marks on the surface. Scratches on the surface, are visually and sensuously unpleasant, reduce shine and can weaken the surface, potentially leading to further damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The composition of the present invention employs an abrasive component having hardness of 2 to 4 as measured according to MOHS hardness scale. The MOHS hardness scale is an internationally recognised scale for measuring the hardness of a compound versus a compound of known hardness, see Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk-Othmer, 4<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>Edition Vol 1, page 18 or Lide, D. R (ed) CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 73<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>edition, Boca Raton, Fla.: The Rubber Company, 1992-1993. The abrasive component is substantially insoluble or partially soluble in water. Most preferably the abrasive component is calcium carbonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The abrasive component preferably has average particle size of less than 300 microns, more preferably less than 100 microns and most preferably from 5 to 100 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The abrasive component is preferably present in the composition in sufficient amount to provide an abrasive action. More Preferably the abrasive component in present at a level of from 50% to 99%, more preferably from 60% to 95% and most preferably from 75% to 90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore it has also been found that the preferred weight ratio of oxalic acid to carbonate is in the range of from 1:1 to 1:18, more preferably from 1:6 to 1:9 and most preferably from 1:7 to 1:8. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Process of Preparing the Composition </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also claimed herein is a process of preparing the composition of the present invention. The process requires the steps of premixing the abrasive and any wet or water-containing ingredients; drying the premix formed in the preceding step to achieve a composition having a moisture content of less than 10%, preferably less than 5% water; and subsequently mixing the substantially dry premix with the carboxylic acid, preferably oxalic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment where pigment and/or perfume are present these ingredients are preferably added in additional step preceding the step of mixing the abrasive with the wet or water-containing ingredients. In this preceding step, a proportion of the abrasive is mixed with the perfume and pigment in order to achieve a homogenous distribution of perfume and/or pigment. Where the pigment is available in particulate form, a preferably 5% solution of pigment in water is mixed with the abrasive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second step requires the drying of the premix. Drying can be achieved passively by allowing moisture to evaporate or actively using any suitable equipment and method. The premix is dried to a point whereby it contains less than 10% water, more preferably less than 5% water at this point the premix is said to be &ldquo;substantially dry&rdquo;. The substantially dry premix is then mixed with the oxalic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Additional optional ingredients, dry or substantially dry ingredients, can be added before or after the drying step, but must not have the effect of increasing the water content of the composition to higher than 10% water. In a preferred embodiment all additional ingredients namely wet, water-containing, dry or substantially dry ingredients are added to the composition prior to the drying step. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Optional Ingredients </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention may include one or more optional ingredients. Such optional ingredients may be selected from the group consisting of surfactants, inorganic acids, chelating agents, reducing agents, perfume and colouring agent </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Surfactants </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention optionally although preferably comprise a surfactant. Surfactants provide additional cleaning performance benefits by removing a number of different types of soils for example greasy, oily soils. It has also been seen by the Applicants that due to the reaction of especially carbonate and oxalic acid, the evolution of gas, CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, in combination with a surfactant results in the formation of foam. The presence of foam is aesthetically pleasing to consumers, which is then related to cleaning performance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The compositions above are typically prepared by mixing the calcium carbonate and all other ingredients with the exception of any acids to form a premix, allowing the premix to dry or actively drying the premix if necessary, to achieve a composition which contains less than 5% moisture. The substantially dry premix is then mixed with the oxalic acid to form a homogeneous composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Where pigment forms a component of the composition, a 5% solution of pigment in water is prepared and then mixed with a small proportion (approximately 10%) of the calcium carbonate. Equally when perfume is present in the composition it is also added to a small proportion of carbonate prior to mixing with the remaining ingredients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In a preferred additional step after the addition of perfume and pigment where present in the composition, &plusmn;10% of the CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) is mixed with the HLAS until the surfactant and the carbonate are homogeneously mixed. </paragraph>
