<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a clamping device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a hybrid type clamping device in which a hydraulic drive system used for a large clamping device and an electric drive system used for a small clamping device are combined with each other. Further, the present invention relates to a method of increasing and decreasing hydraulic pressure used in this clamping device. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method of releasing a mold. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, main stream clamping devices used for injection molding machines or die casting machines are hydraulic drive systems such as direct pressure type clamping devices or toggle type clamping devices. Recently, in order to meet the demand of saving energy and making the working environment clean, an electric drive type clamping device, in which a mold can be opened and closed when a rotary motion of a servo motor is converted into a linear motion of the mold by a ball screw nut, has been widely used, especially in the field of small molding machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, although this small clamping device in which the electric drive system is used can meet the demand of saving energy and making the working environment clean, when the size of this small clamping device is proportionally increased so that the electric drive system can be applied to a large clamping device, the size of the clamping device cannot be increased very much because an increase in the size of a servo motor, and of a ball screw, are restricted. In order to solve the above problems, a hybrid type clamping device, in which an electric drive system is used for a mold opening and closing means and a hydraulic system is used for a clamping force generating means, has been devised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-246806 discloses an example of the hybrid type clamping device in which a metallic mold is opened and closed when a movable platen is moved by a screwing motion of a male screw conducted by an AC servo motor, and a clamping motion conducted after the mold has been closed is conducted by a hydraulic means. This hydraulic clamping device is composed as follows. At the back of the movable platen, a hydraulic operating board is arranged which includes a closed chamber having a tightly closed bladder into which hydraulic fluid is charged. After the hydraulic operating board has been locked together with a movable platen, the male screw member is further moved by an electric motor. Due to the foregoing, the tightly closed bladder is pressurized, so that a clamping force is given to a metallic mold by a piston and via the movable platen. In the case of opening the metallic mold, the male screw member is reversed so that the movable platen can be drawn in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the conventional hybrid type clamping device described above, while the tightly closed bladder is being pressurized by the male screw in the closed chamber, the pressurizing action is maintained when the male screw member is screwed by an AC servo motor by a ball screw mechanism. Further, both the mold releasing and the mold opening are conducted when the male screw member is screwed in the same manner. Therefore, in the working time when the mold is opened and closed and when the clamping force is given to the mold and when the mold is released, a load must be always given to the electric motor which is a drive source. Therefore, it is impossible to sufficiently accomplish energy saving. Further, since both the electric drive system and the hydraulic drive system are jointly used, the structure of the clamping device becomes complicated, and the frequency of mechanical breakdown is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The above conventional hybrid type clamping device is composed in such a manner that the tightly closed bladder is pressurized by the male screw in the closed chamber. Therefore, unless air is completely removed from the tightly closed bladder when the tightly closed bladder is charged with hydraulic fluid, the clamping force cannot be appropriately given to the mold. It is very difficult to form the tightly closed bladder into which hydraulic fluid is charged in accordance with a volume of the stationary closed chamber. Further, as the tightly closed bladder is deformed into a recessed shape, there is a possibility that the bladder is damaged and the hydraulic fluid leaks out from the bladder. Therefore, it is impossible to increase the clamping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, the clamping device used for a conventional injection molding machine or die casting machine is composed in such a manner that a stationary platen and a movable platen, to which metallic molds are respectively attached, which are connected with each other by tie rods, are fixed to each other at a mold closing position by a platen lock means. Usually, the platen lock means is composed of a pair of split nuts capable of being opened and closed. When the pair of split nuts are engaged with ring grooves or screw grooves, the movable platen can be fixed and held at the mold clamping position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this connection, when a metallic mold is changed, the thickness (die-height) of the metallic mold is changed. Therefore, the mold closing position is naturally changed, and the lock position of the movable platen is also changed. When the die-height is changed as described above, the pitch of engagement of a split nut with a tie rod is shifted in some cases. Accordingly, there is usually provided a die-height adjusting mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a conventionally well known die-height adjusting mechanism, as disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 44-16008, there is provided a mechanism in which tie rods are arranged so that they can be moved in the axial direction with respect to a stationary platen so that a phase shift caused between a split nut and the tie rod can be adjusted. Further, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-235741, there is provided a mechanism in which a clamping cylinder is fixed onto a mount moving when a mold is opened and closed, and a movable platen capable of moving on this mount is connected to the clamping cylinder, and when a phase shift is caused between a split nut and a tie rod at a mold closing position, a distance between the clamping cylinder and the movable platen is adjusted so that the die-height can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, the former mechanism is disadvantageous in that the tie rod must be made movable with respect to the stationary platen, so that the size of the device is increased and the clamping accuracy is deteriorated. The latter mechanism is disadvantageous in that a large-scale device is required for adjusting the die-height. Further, it is necessary to compose the device in such a manner that while the clamping cylinder is being moved together with the movable platen, the distance between them must be made variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the case of a booster-ram type clamping device, the mold opening is conducted in a front hydraulic chamber of the clamping cylinder. Therefore, the accuracy of the entire inner face of the clamping cylinder must be high, and further the diameter is extended. Accordingly, it is hard to conduct precision machining, which results in increasing the manufacturing cost. In the case where the clamping cylinder, the diameter of which is large, is used for opening the mold as described above, the total length of a die casting machine or an injection molding machine is extended, and it becomes difficult to install the die casting machine or the injection molding machine in a small space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above problems, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-94864 discloses the following arrangement. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</cross-reference>, the metallic mold attaching plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is put and held on the stationary platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, at a plurality of corners of which the tie rods <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are provided, and the cylinder holes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> open to the metallic mold attaching plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> side are formed on the stationary platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, there are provided rams <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are slidably engaged with the cylinder holes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>), to which hydraulic pressure is applied, is provided in each cylinder hole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When hydraulic pressure in the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is increased, a pushing force is given via the ram <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so that the metallic mold attaching plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be pushed to the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, when the aforementioned tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is used, the following problems may be encountered. In the case where hydraulic oil is supplied into the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to expand the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and push the ram <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or in the case where hydraulic oil is discharged from the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to retract the ram <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and contract the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, when the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is repeatedly expanded and contracted, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</cross-reference>, a portion of the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pushed into clearance H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the stationary platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the ram <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When the device is used in this state over a long period of time, the tightly closed bladder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is finally damaged. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In view of the above conventional problems, the present invention has been accomplished. It is an object of the present invention to provide a compact clamping device and a method of releasing a mold characterized in that: while energy saving is sufficiently accomplished, a high clamping force is generated; and while a hydraulic source is used in common between the clamping pressure mechanism and the mold releasing mechanism, a mold releasing motion can be conducted separately from the clamping mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, another object of the present invention is described as follows. A mold releasing force is given by an electrically driven ball screw mechanism for opening and closing a mold and, while the energy consumption of the electrically driven ball screw mechanism is reduced, the electric driving and the hydraulic driving are preferably combined with other so as to save energy in the processes of clamping and releasing the mold. It is another object of the present invention to accomplish saving in the entire energy consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a pressurizing mechanism in which hydraulic oil is charged and pressure is generated by the expansion and contraction of hydraulic oil, and this pressurizing mechanism has a structure by which air can be completely removed from the mechanism. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a clamping device in which the above pressurizing mechanism is utilized. In addition to that, it is still another object of the present invention to provide a compact clamping device in which the pressurizing mechanism is utilized while energy can be sufficiently saved and a high intensity clamping force can be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a pressurizing mechanism of a clamping device characterized in that: the total length of a die casting machine or an injection molding machine can be reduced to as small as possible; the installing space is reduced; the clamping motion can be quickly conducted; and the durability of the mechanism is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a clamping device characterized in that: the structure is very simple; and the die-height can be appropriately adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of increasing and decreasing hydraulic pressure for clamping capable of realizing energy saving and generating a high intensity clamping force. It is still another object of the present invention to realize saving energy in the clamping process by reducing energy consumption of a drive source after hydraulic pressure has been increased to a value necessary for a clamping force and also by maintaining a pump motor in a state of no load so that energy saving can be accomplished in entire energy consumption. It is still another object of the present invention to prevent the occurrence of vibration and abnormal sound caused when pressure is suddenly reduced in the case of decreasing a clamping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a clamping device characterized in that: hydraulic energy can be transmitted to the clamping device from a hydraulic pressure generating mechanism arranged outside via a hydraulic circuit while hydraulic pressure generating mechanism is not being incorporated into the clamping device; the structure is simple; and the property of saving energy is high and the accuracy of control is excellent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In order to accomplish the above objects, in an embodiment of a clamping device of the present invention, a pressurizing mechanism comprises: a movable platen having a movable metallic mold, arranged to be capable of going forward and back; a stationary platen having a stationary metallic mold, arranged opposite to the movable platen; a pressure plate arranged between the stationary platen and the stationary metallic mold, the stationary metallic mold being attached to the pressure plate; a piston slidably engaged in a cylinder arranged in the stationary platen, the piston being capable of protruding toward the pressure plate; a bladder arranged between the piston and the cylinder of the stationary platen, the bladder being expanded and contracted when pressure is supplied and discharged, so that clamping can be conducted between the movable and the stationary metallic die via the piston; and a soft protective member interposed between the piston and the bladder, capable of filling a gap formed between them when the bladder is expanded. When the piston is protruded by the expansion of the bladder, a pressure force for clamping is given between the movable metallic mold and the stationary metallic mold via the pressure plate. Further, intrusion of the bladder into the gap is prevented by the sealing action of the soft protective member so that the bladder can be prevented from being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a clamping device of the present invention is composed as follows. A stationary platen and movable platen, which are connected to each other by tie rods, to which metallic molds are attached, can be opened and closed by an electrically driven ball screw mechanism. One of the above platens is composed of a platen body and a pressure plate attached to the platen body, the pressure plate being capable of coming into contact with and separating from the platen body, at least in a range of a clamping stroke. The clamping device includes a pressurizing mechanism for clamping between the platen body and the pressure plate. The pressurizing mechanism is composed in such a manner that when a bladder, into which hydraulic oil can be introduced, and arranged in a cylinder, is expanded and contracted, a piston can be pushed out. An insert die, the shape of which is identical with that of the internal shape of the bladder, is housed in the bladder. A hydraulic path is formed in the insert die. A ball screw member of the electrically driven ball screw mechanism is supported while being capable of moving in the axial direction. A brake means for braking rotation is provided in the ball screw member. A mold releasing cylinder mechanism for generating a mold releasing force in the axial direction is connected to it. A hydraulic pressure supply source is commonly used between this mold releasing cylinder mechanism and the aforementioned bladder. When a hydraulic oil path is changed over, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism can be operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In this structure, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism is composed in such a manner that hydraulic oil in the clamping hydraulic circuit can be supplied to the mold releasing cylinder mechanism. It is preferable to adopt the following structure. In the hydraulic path to the mold releasing cylinder mechanism, there is provided a hydraulic pressure containing means for containing hydraulic pressure at a position of the origin of the ball screw member so that a movement in the axial direction can be restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the above structure, the pressurizing means includes a cylinder section and a piston which is housed in the cylinder section and capable of reciprocating in the cylinder section. The cylinder section accommodates a bladder which is expanded and contracted when hydraulic oil is supplied to and discharged from it so that the piston can be pushed out. This bladder houses an insert die, the shape of which is identical with that of the internal structure of the bladder. An opening edge section of the bladder is contacted with pressure and fixed to between the insert die and the cylinder section. Hydraulic oil can be supplied to the bladder from the hydraulic path formed in the insert die. In this case, when a protrusion is formed in the bladder and an engaging groove to be engaged with the protrusion is formed in the insert die, the bladder can be fixed to the insert die so that the insert die cannot be drawn out. A notch step section is formed in the peripheral edge of the piston at which the piston is opposed to the bladder, and a soft protective member is arranged in this notch step section so that it can be opposed to the pushing peripheral edge of the bladder. It is preferable that an oil leakage detecting means is arranged on a sliding face of the piston in the cylinder section so as to detect the occurrence of damage of the bladder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of a clamping device of the present invention, in a clamping device in which a stationary platen and a movable platen, which are connected with each other by tie rods, to which metallic molds are attached, can be fixed at a mold closing position by a platen lock means, a wall thickness changing plate means is provided between the platen lock means and the platen. A clamping device in which a stationary platen and movable platen, which are connected with each other by tie rods, to which metallic molds are attached, can be fixed to each other at a mold closing position by a platen lock means, comprises a wedge mechanism for adjusting a position of the platen lock means in the axial direction of the tie rod by the wedge action. The wedge mechanism is composed of a stationary wedge and movable wedge which are interposed between the platen lock means and the platen and come into contact with each other on an oblique face. In this arrangement, the wedge thickness may be changed by providing an insertion depth adjusting mechanism for adjusting an insertion depth of the movable wedge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a method of controlling an increase and decrease in clamping hydraulic pressure which will be described as follows. After a mold has been closed by a stationary platen and movable platen, which are connected with each other by tie rods, to which metallic molds are attached, hydraulic pressure is introduced into a pressurizing mechanism capable of pushing out a pressure plate attached to a platen body, the pressure plate being capable of coming into contact with and separating from the platen body, so that a clamping force is generated. In the case of increasing hydraulic pressure, a rotating speed of a piston pump is controlled so as to supply hydraulic oil to the pressurizing mechanism. After hydraulic pressure has increased to a clamping pressure, the hydraulic pressure is contained on the pressurizing mechanism side. After that, when a reverse speed of the piston pump is controlled, hydraulic pressure in a hydraulic oil path on the upstream side of the pressure containing position is gradually decreased. After the hydraulic pressure has been sufficiently decreased, the piston pump is stopped. In the case of decreasing hydraulic pressure, when a rotating speed of the piston pump is controlled, hydraulic oil is supplied to the pressurizing mechanism. Due to the foregoing, after the hydraulic pressure has increased to clamping pressure, hydraulic pressure in a hydraulic oil path on the upstream side of the containing position is increased from a state in which hydraulic pressure is contained on the pressurizing mechanism side until the pressures before and after the containing position become equal by operating the piston pump. After the containing state has been released, the reversing speed of the piston pump is controlled, so that hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic oil path on the upstream side of the containing position is gradually decreased and opened onto the tank side. In this way, a clamping force is controlled by increasing and decreasing pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A method of releasing a mold of the present invention will be described as follows. A stationary platen and movable platen, which are connected with each other by tie rods, to which metallic molds are attached, open and close the metallic molds by an electrically driven ball screw mechanism. With respect to at least one of the platens, when hydraulic pressure is introduced into a bladder capable of being expanded and contracted or hydraulic pressure is introduced into a cylinder mechanism which moves forward and back by hydraulic pressure, a piston is pushed and clamping is conducted. While a screw member of the electrically driven ball screw mechanism is being supported by the platen being capable of moving in the axial direction, the screw member is restricted so that it cannot be rotated, and the ball screw member is moved in the axial direction by hydraulic force so as to generate a mold releasing force. In this case, when mold releasing is started, a brake means for restricting a rotation of the screw member is operated, and hydraulic oil is supplied from a clamping hydraulic source to a mold releasing cylinder mechanism for moving the ball screw member in the axial direction, so that a mold releasing operation is conducted. Next, the brake means is released, and the mold is opened by an electrical operation. After the mold opening motion has been completed, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism is returned to a position of the origin, and then hydraulic oil is enclosed in the mold releasing cylinder mechanism so that it cannot be moved. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment of a clamping device and a method of releasing a mold of the present invention will be explained, in detail, as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing a model of a clamping device of an embodiment of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a rear view of a stationary platen, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a partial sectional view of a mold opening and closing means, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an appearance view of a mold opening and closing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> First of all, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes: a stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> vertically arranged on one end portion of the machine base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while a base section of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fixed to the machine base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a key; and a movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> arranged opposed to this stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being capable of sliding on the machine base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a guide shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are respectively attached to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is moved in such a manner that it comes into contact with and separates from the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the mold can be opened and closed. At the center of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there is provided a space <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into which a portion of an injection molding machine proceeds, so that melted resin can be supplied into a cavity formed by the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At the center on the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> side, there is provided a product pushing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, by which a molded product can be ejected from the molds which are open and away from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At the four corners of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there are provided rod holes. One end of each tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is fixed in each rod hole. In the same manner, at the four corners of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, there are provided rod holes. Each tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> penetrates each rod hole. Due to the above structure, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is capable of sliding on the machine base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while the tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are being used as guides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the molding work conducted by the clamping device composed of the above essential components, when the movable platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is moved, the molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are closed and locked by the tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> cannot be moved. Next, the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are clamped by a high intensity of force so that the molds cannot be opened in the process of injection molding. After the completion of injection molding, the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are separated from each other by a force, the intensity of which is approximately one fifteenth of the clamping force, and then the molds are opened so as to take out the molded product out of the molds. In order to accomplish the above series of work, the above clamping device includes: a mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for moving the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the mold opening position and the mold closing position; a platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for fixing the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by utilizing a split nut; a pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for generating a clamping force at the mold closing positions of the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; a hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for supplying hydraulic oil to pressurize the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; and a control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> for controlling these components. The clamping device of this embodiment adopts a hybrid structure in which a mold opening and closing motion is conducted by the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is an opening and closing operation mechanism to be electrically driven, and clamping of the molds is conducted by a hydraulic means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The following explanations will be made according to the procedure of molding work. That is, first, the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be explained. Then, the platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and pressurizing means <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will be successively explained. Finally, the hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> First, the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is realized by an electrically driven type ball screw mechanism, which is composed as follows. The ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is pivotally supported by the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and extended toward the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> side in parallel with the tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. On the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> opposed to a forward end portion of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, there is provided a through-hole <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> into which the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can proceed. To a step portion formed in the opening section of the through-hole <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which is screwed with the screw section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, is attached by bolts. Due to the above structure, when the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is rotated at a constant position on the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> moves forward and separates from the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together with the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in the rear view of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this ball screw mechanism is arranged at two positions on the diagonal line of the platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. One is a right upper corner in the drawing, and the other is a left lower corner. The above two ball screw mechanisms are rotated synchronously with each other. Therefore, the pulley <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is attached to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the belt <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> connected with the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is attached to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and used for opening and closing the molds, is drawn to the pulley <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that belt <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be wound round the pulley <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In this way, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Due to the above structure, when the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is operated and the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is rotated, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> proceeds to and retracts from the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together with the guide shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the screwing action of the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In this way, the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attached to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be opened and closed with respect to the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In this connection, in this clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, clamping is conducted by the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> described later, and then injection molding is executed. After this molding work has been completed, the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adhere to each other. Therefore, this mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with a structure for releasing the molds. For the mold releasing work, it is necessary to give a mold releasing force, the intensity of which is approximately one fifteenth of the intensity of the clamping force. In order to generate this mold releasing force, there is provided a mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for moving the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the axial direction, and its piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is extended by a hydraulic force, so that the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved in the axial direction and the mold releasing force can be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As the appearance is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is arranged at a side position of the rotary mechanism transmitting section of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and fixed at the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is arranged in such a manner that the extending and contracting direction is parallel to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected with the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> via the slider block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The slider block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is capable of sliding on an outer face of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, while the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is being rotatably supported by the double row tapered roller bearing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> penetrates the slider block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is fixed in the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Further, there is provided an electromagnetic brake means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for braking a rotation of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This electromagnetic brake means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a stationary unit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and a clutch unit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> loosely penetrates the stationary unit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and the stationary unit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is attached and supported in such a manner that it is moved integrally with the slider block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The clutch unit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is attached to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via the key <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> so that it cannot be rotated round the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the clutch unit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is joined to the stationary unit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> by an electromagnetic input, the brake is applied to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. When the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is simply moved in the axial direction, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is rotated by the action of the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is prevented from rotating by the electromagnetic brake means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and an axial force of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be smoothly transmitted to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a mold releasing force via the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, spline grooves <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are formed at a shaft end portion of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In order to transmit a rotation of the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> described before to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, these spline grooves <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are engaged with the boss hole of the pulley <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Due to the above structure, even when the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved in the axial direction by the action of the mold releasing cylinder <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> described before, the rotary drive system is not affected by the movement of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Due to the above structure, in this embodiment, it is possible to execute a mold releasing action by forcibly pushing out the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> side by hydraulic force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of a platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for fixing and holding the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the metallic molds can be maintained at the mold closed position after the metallic molds have been closed. This device is arranged in a penetrating portion of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the back of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, on the outer circumferential face of the middle section of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a plurality of ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are made at regular intervals. On the other hand, at the rear section of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is attached to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being restricted so that the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be moved in the radial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is provided with teeth capable of engaging with the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. When a pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are moved while the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is being interposed between the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are engaged with the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is positioned and fixed to the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be moved being opened and closed in the radial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by the drive of the nut cylinder. When the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the movable metallic die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are moved being opened and closed, the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are opened in such a manner that they are separated from each other, so that the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are disengaged from the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and held in this disengaged state. When a clamping force is given, the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are closed and moved, so that the teeth of the split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are engaged with the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Due to the foregoing, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be engaged with each other at an engaging position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this connection, in the above platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the pitch of the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is the same as the pitch of the engaging teeth of the split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. However, in the state that the movable metallic die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in contact with the stationary metallic die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, unless the phase of the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> agrees with the phase of the engaging teeth of the split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> so that the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be appropriately engaged with the engaging teeth of the split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, it is impossible to hold the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in an appropriate engaging state. Therefore, in the case of replacing the metallic mold, before molding is conducted, it is necessary to adjust an engaging position so that both phases can agree with each other according to the metallic mold thickness (die-height). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, between the platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, there is provided a wall thickness changing plate means operated by a wedge action of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> so as to conduct the die-height adjustment. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) having a pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is attached to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that it can be moved in the axial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> composed of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is interposed in a gap formed between the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. That is, the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which are joined to each other on an oblique face, are interposed between the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and a position of the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> with respect to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be set by the total thickness of both the wedges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is attached to the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> side. On the other hand, the movable wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is made to be movable in the radial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. While both the wedges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are being connected with the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> by means of dove-tail groove connection, the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is attached so that it can be moved in a gap formed between the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In this way, it is possible to change a joining thickness of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, so that the split nut <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can be moved and adjusted in the axial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, only when the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is moved in the radial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a distance between the split nut <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be changed. Due to the foregoing, it is possible to adjust an engaging position by a simple operation of moving the wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> so that the die-height can be simply changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are views showing the structure in detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a sectional plan view showing a specific structure of the platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having the above die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> arranged in each tie rod portion. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> is a partial perspective view. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view taken on line A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> are views showing a drive system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> First, the structure of the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> will be explained below. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 7</cross-reference>, this split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> includes a support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> slidably attached to the two support rods <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> attached to the rear face of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The support rods <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> are attached in an upper portion of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in parallel with the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can be moved in the axial direction of the tie rod. Two nut guide rods <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, which are arranged perpendicular to the support rods <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, horizontally penetrate the support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. A pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are attached onto both sides of the nut guide rods <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> while the support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is interposed between the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Due to the above structure, the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can pinch the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from both sides. The nut guide rod <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> penetrates a lower portion of the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be opened and closed in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Ends of the upper and the lower nut guide rods <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are fixed to the left split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and the upper and the lower nut guide rods <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> penetrate the right split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The upper and the lower nut guide rods <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which penetrate the right split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, are connected with and fixed to the cylinder attaching plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to which the air cylinder <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is attached. The rod <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the air cylinder <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is connected with the right split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. When this air cylinder <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> acts, the right and the left split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be opened and closed. In order to synchronously open and close the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the pinion rack mechanism <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is arranged in a portion where the support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are opposed to each other. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> pair of racks <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are respectively fixed to the right and the left split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and arranged in parallel with each other while the tooth faces of the racks <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are being opposed to each other. The pinion gear <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> engaging with both racks <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is attached to the support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> side (Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 7</cross-reference>.). When the rod <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the air cylinder <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is extended and contracted, the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be equally synchronously opened and closed with respect to the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is interposed between the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> composed as described above. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there are provided the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the oblique faces of which are joined to each other, in the rear face portion of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is formed into a wedge shape, one face of which is oblique in such a manner that one end portion of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is thin and the wall thickness is gradually increased as it comes to the other end portion. On the other hand, the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed into a reverse wedge shape. When the oblique face of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and that of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are joined to each other, while the joined wall thickness is made uniform as a whole, the thickness can be changed. When both wedges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are relatively displaced along the oblique faces, the joined wall thickness can be changed. Accordingly, when this wedge mechanism is interposed between the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the rear face of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it is possible to change the lock position determined by the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with respect to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In order to prevent both wedges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from interfering with the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, on the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> side, there is provided a circular through-hole <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, the diameter of which is a little larger than that of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and on the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> side, there is provided an oval-shaped through-hole <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the traverse guide grooves <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are formed on an upper and a lower end face of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. On the rear face of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, there are provided guide pawls <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> engaging with the above traverse guide grooves <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, so that the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be moved in the traverse direction along the rear face of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. On the oblique face of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, there is provided a dove-tail groove <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, the width of which is constant. On the other hand, in the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the oblique face of which is joined to that of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, there is provided a dove-tail <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Both are slidably joined to each other along the oblique face under the condition that the dove-tail <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> cannot be drawn out from the dove-tail groove <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is attached to the split nut <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, on the right and the left end face of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the restricting grooves <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are formed. On the other hand, in each of the right and the left split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the restricting protrusion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to be engaged in the above restricting groove <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is provided. The engaging length of the restricting protrusion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is set so that the restricting protrusion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> can stay in the restricting groove <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> even when the pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> have been separated from each other in the case of releasing the lock. When the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is opened, the restricting width of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is extended. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from swaying in the traverse direction. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, the sway preventing mechanism is composed as follows. In the support block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, there is provided a sway preventing key <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> which is protruding toward an upper end face of the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. On the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> side, there is provided a sway preventing block <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> in which the engaging groove <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of the key <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is formed. Therefore, even when the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is open, the stationary wedge <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be held at a predetermined position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The above die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is capable of adjusting an engaging position of the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> by changing the wedge thickness when the above movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is traversed. This operation is conducted by the ball screw mechanism <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> provided in the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the ball nut <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is fixed at an end face portion of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> on the maximum thickness side and screwed to the ball screw <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. This ball screw <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is pivotally supported by the bearing <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> provided in the bracket <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> fixed onto an external end face of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is protruded from an end face of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The pulley <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is attached to a forward end portion of the ball screw <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and driven by the motor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provided with the die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is arranged at each tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the example shown in the drawing, the platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are arranged at four positions. In order to operate these four platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by one drive source, in the embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the right and the left movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which are arranged in the movable direction of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, are connected with each other by the connecting rod <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, so that the right and the left movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be moved while being linked with each other. In order for the upper and the lower movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to be linked with each other, the pulley <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and the motor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are connected with each other by the winding belt <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), so that the die-height adjustment can be synchronously conducted at all positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> composed as described above, when the motor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is driven so as to rotate the ball screw <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, the ball nut <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> arranged in the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is screwed and moved forward. Due to the foregoing, a plurality of movable wedges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are linked with each other, so that the joining thickness of the wedges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be changed. Therefore, an engaging position of the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> with the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is changed in the axial direction. Accordingly, the phase of engagement can be changed according to the change in the die-height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the case where the die-height is changed when the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are replaced, a stopping position of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be detected by a position sensor when the metallic molds are closed by the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, since the position and the pitch of the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which are formed on the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the position and the pitch of the engaging teeth of the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are already been known, the control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is capable of finding a quantity of difference of the phase between the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by calculation. A relation between the quantity of insertion of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the die-height adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the joining thickness of the wedge is already known. Therefore, a quantity of movement of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> necessary for correcting a difference in the engaging phase can be found by calculation. The control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> calculates a necessary quantity of movement of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and outputs the result of calculation as a quantity of rotation of the wedge drive motor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the wedge drive motor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the pulley <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the ball screw <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, which is arranged in a pair of die-height adjusting mechanisms <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, through the winding belt <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. Due to the foregoing, the ball screw <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is rotated, and the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at which the ball nut <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is fixed is moved in the traverse direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</cross-reference>. The movable wedges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the die-height adjusting mechanisms <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which are arranged in the traverse direction, are synchronously driven by the connecting rod <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the movable wedges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the four die-height adjusting mechanisms <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are moved by the same distance of movement. Due to the foregoing, the stationary nut <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the oblique face of which is joined to that of the movable wedge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, is moved in the axial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so that the split nut unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is displaced along the support rod <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is moved and adjusted by a quantity of difference of the phase in the axial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is interposed by the spit nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, it is possible to conduct locking while the phase of the engaging teeth on the nut side is made to agree with the phase of the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In this connection, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C, backlash B exists between the ring groove <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a small difference between the engaging positions can be allowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, after the mold closing motion has been completed by operating the above platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the mold clamping work is started. Explanations will be made into the structure of the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to generate a clamping force in the mold clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes: a platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> directly fixed to the machine base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; and a pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to which the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached. The stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is set in such a manner that the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be separated from the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in a range of the mold clamping stroke. The tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> penetrate the tie rod holes formed at four corners on the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached at the center of the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> opposed to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Further, as shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> having a step portion, which are formed from the metallic mold attaching face side of the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, are provided in the circumferential direction. The connecting bolts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are inserted into these through-holes <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, so that the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be connected with the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> by means of screws. The coned disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is accommodated between the step portion of each through-hole <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> having a step portion and the head portion of the connecting bolt <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. By the action of the coned disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be usually held in a condition in which the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is joined to the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In the case where a mold clamping force is generated, the coned disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is deflected, so that the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be moved in the mold clamping direction by a mold clamping stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In order to make the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> conduct a mold clamping action, the annular groove-shaped cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is formed in the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and opened to the opposing section of the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Actually, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, the annular cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is integrally formed in the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the annular cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> surrounds the space <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into which an injection molding machine proceeds (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is formed in this cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is slidably attached into an opening section of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. By the pushing action of this piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the pressurizing plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can conduct a mold clamping action. This piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be pushed out by hydraulic pressure. Therefore, in a space, which becomes a hydraulic chamber, surrounded by the bottom portion of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, there is provided a bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> which is expanded and contracted when hydraulic oil is supplied to and discharged from it. By the action of this bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be pushed out. This bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is made of oil-proof rubber and, for example, this bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is made of flexible material such as nitrile rubber used as a material for O-rings. This bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the space without leaving any gap. When this bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded and contracted by supplying hydraulic oil, which is pressurized and controlled by the hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> described later, into this bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> or by discharging hydraulic oil from this bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be moved in the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In this connection, in the case where the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is used for clamping the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the horizontal direction and a pressurizing force is generated by this bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> when hydraulic oil is supplied to and discharged from the space tightly closed by the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to completely discharge air from the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> when hydraulic oil is charged into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Unless air is completely discharged from the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the clamping force is not appropriately given to the metallic mold. It is very difficult to form the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, into which hydraulic oil is charged, according to a volume of the closed stationary space. As the bladder is deformed, there is a possibility that hydraulic oil leaks out from the bladder because the bladder is damaged. Therefore, it is impossible to increase a mold clamping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above problems, in this embodiment, the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the shape of which is identical with the internal shape of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, is housed in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and an opening edge portion of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is pinched and fixed between the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and hydraulic oil is supplied into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> through the hydraulic path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> formed in the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> are views showing, in detail, the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> into which the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is incorporated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an unpressurized state in which hydraulic oil is not supplied, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a pressurized state in which hydraulic oil is supplied. The piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is inserted onto the opening side of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> formed in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. In a rear space of this piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is accommodated which is fixed to the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> by the fastening bolt <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is formed into a shape by which almost all the above space is occupied. Therefore, a cross section of the space formed along the inner wall face is a C-shape, that is, a thin C-shaped gap is formed. The bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, which is made of a thick rubber sheet filling this C-shaped cross section gap, is attached onto the outer circumferential face of the above insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and fixed between the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The appearances of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the entire bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is formed into an annular profile so that it can surround the space <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) into which an injection molding device proceeds. The bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> includes: a piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> directly coming into contact with the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>; an inner circumferential face portion <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> which is folded at the inner circumferential edge perpendicularly to the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and capable of coming into contact with a wall face of the cylinder section; and an outer circumferential face portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which is folded at the outer circumferential edge perpendicularly to the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> so that the outer circumferential face portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> can be contacted with a wall face of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Further, there are provided a pair of ear pieces <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> which are folded at the end edges of the inner circumferential face <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and the outer circumferential face <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in parallel with the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. A space formed between the opposed ear pieces <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is open, and the insert die can be attached from this opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes an insert die body <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> having a space surrounded by the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, inner circumferential face <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, outer circumferential face <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and ear pieces <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> further includes a protruding portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> which protrudes from the opening of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and forms an attaching face to be attached to the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the entire insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is formed into a ring shape, the cross section of which is formed into a convex-shape. This insert die <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is inserted into and tightly contacted with the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In this insert die <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, there are provided a plurality of hydraulic paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> which are formed from the protruding portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> toward the inner face of the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> plurality of hydraulic paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are provided at appropriate regular intervals along the circumferential line of the annular insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in the drawing, four hydraulic paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are provided. When hydraulic oil is supplied to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> through these hydraulic paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in which the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is housed is fixed to a bottom portion of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, there is provided a receiving recess portion <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> at the bottom portion <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The protruding portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is engaged in the receiving recess portion <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is fixed by the fastening bolts <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The ear pieces <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are engaged with the step portions provided on both sides of the protruding portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. In this way, the inside of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is formed into a tightly closed space. On front and back faces of the bladder ear pieces <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> arranged between the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the bottom portion of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as a portion is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, there are provided protrusions <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> which are perpendicular to the ear pieces <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> being formed into a cross. On the other hand, on the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> side, there are provided engaging grooves <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> for receiving the protrusions <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In the same manner, there are provided engaging grooves <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> at the bottom portion of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Due to the above structure, it is possible to prevent the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, into which hydraulic oil is supplied, is drawn out from the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. A fastening interference of the fastening bolt <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is made to be smaller than the wall thickness of the bladder ear piece <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> so as to provide a sealing function of sealing hydraulic pressure at the fastening portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in which the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is housed is attached in the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. When hydraulic oil is supplied to an inner face portion of the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded in the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> proceeds forward so that the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be pushed out as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Hydraulic oil is supplied through the hydraulic paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> described before. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the annular hydraulic path <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is formed in the receiving recess portion <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, the annular hydraulic path <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is formed on a surface of the insert die body <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> which is opposed to the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In this way, a plurality of hydraulic paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are communicated with each other. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, hydraulic oil is introduced through the supply oil path <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> formed in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The supply oil path <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> is connected with the hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> described later. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, at least on the upper side of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, there is provided an air bleed path <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> communicating with the neighborhood hydraulic path <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>, so that air bleeding can be conducted when hydraulic pressure is introduced at the initial stage. After hydraulic oil has been introduced at the initial stage, the air bleeding path <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is plugged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> inserted into the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, there are provided cut-out portions <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> which are respectively formed at the circumferential edges opposed to the inner and the outer edge corner of the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In these cut-out portions <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> made of soft material such as woven fiber are attached, so that a pushing force given from the inner and the outer circumferential edge of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be received. In the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> made of rubber which is repeatedly expanded and contracted, the corners are intensely deteriorated. Therefore, when hydraulic pressure is directly received by the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> slides on the cylinder wall face, there is a possibility that the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is damaged. Therefore, when the corners of the bladder are received by the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> made of soft material in which fibers are woven, deterioration and damage of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there is provided an oil leakage inspection hydraulic path <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> on the sliding face of the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> in the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Since hydraulic oil, which has leaked out from the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> when it is damaged, is detected through this inspection hydraulic path <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, it is possible to find a leakage of hydraulic oil early. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In this connection, in the above embodiment, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is formed into an annular shape because of the existence of the space <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into which an injection molding machine proceeds. However, it is possible to adopt an arrangement in which the bladder is formed into a small disk-shaped bladder, and a plurality of small disk-shaped bladders are arranged around the space <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into which an injection molding machine proceeds. Of course, in the case where no obstacles exist, such as in a space into which an injection molding machine proceeds, it is possible to form the bladder into the large disk-shaped bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> and arrange it on the front face of the middle section of the stationary platen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, explanations will be made into a hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for supplying hydraulic oil to the above pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As shown in the drawing, in this hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, hydraulic oil is supplied to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> by means of a variable delivery piston pump by which constant torque control can be accomplished when the pump is driven by the reversible motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is used as this variable delivery piston pump. However, it is also possible to use an angled piston pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic oil supply path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> connected with a discharge port of the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is connected with the supply oil path <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and the supply path of hydraulic oil can be opened and closed by the opening and closing action of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> arranged in the middle of the hydraulic oil path. When the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is closed, the hydraulic path connected to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is locked, and hydraulic pressure on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side can be enclosed. Accordingly, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> functions as an opening and closing control valve for containing hydraulic pressure. The discharge port side of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is connected with the return hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to which the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is attached. When the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is opened and closed, the hydraulic path between the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can be shut off and opened. This second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> functions as an opening and closing control valve for releasing clamping pressure. Accordingly, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> has a structure in which the valve is closed at all times, and the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> has a structure in which the valve is opened at all times. There is provided a relief valve <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> in parallel with the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. In the case where the inner pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is abnormally raised by the action of the injection pressure, the inner pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be released to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this connection, the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> houses a swash plate angle adjusting valve <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> capable of adjusting torque by automatically changing the swash plate angle for controlling torque at a constant value when the pump discharge pressure is raised. In the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is a relief valve arranged in parallel with the swash plate angle adjusting valve <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is a balance adjusting valve for adjusting an operation balance of the swash plate angle adjusting valve <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> by mechanically detecting the swash plate angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The discharge port side of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is connected with the return oil path <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to the tank <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> as described before. On the entrance port side of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, there is provided a by-pass oil path <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> connected with the return hydraulic path <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> being capable of directly communicating with the hydraulic oil supply path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In the by-pass oil path <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, there is provided a by-pass control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> capable of by-passing the pump pressure to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. This by-pass control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is a sequence valve, which is composed in such a manner that the control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> shuts off the by-pass oil path <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> until the pressure on the primary side (pump side) reaches the setting pressure and the control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is fully opened when the pressure on the primary side (pump side) has reached the setting pressure. However, in this embodiment, the setting pressure is variable. Usually, the pump discharge port pressure is introduced as the setting pressure. When it is detected that the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has been excessively moved, the setting pressure is switched to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> side pressure (atmospheric pressure), so that the pump pressure can be by-passed to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In order to by-pass the pump pressure, there is provided a pull roller type direction changeover valve <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> for mechanically detecting an excessive movement of the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> at an advance limit position of the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the case where the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has moved exceeding the advance limit position, the port can be changed over. Two entrance ports of this changeover valve <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> are respectively connected with the pump pressure introducing oil path <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> communicated with the hydraulic oil supply oil path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> on the pump discharge side and also connected with the tank path <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> communicated with the return oil path <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> capable of directly connecting with the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. One portion of the discharge port is connected with the setting pressure introducing oil path <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> which is communicated with the open pressure setting section of the by-pass control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. Usually, the setting is conducted in such a manner that the pump discharge pressure is introduced into the open pressure setting section of the by-pass control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. In the case where the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is further pushed out from the mold clamping completion position, the pressure is changed over to the tank pressure. Further, there is provided a limit switch <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> for electrically detecting an excessive movement of the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. According to the detection conducted by this limit switch <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> composed as described above generates a mold clamping force by supplying hydraulic oil to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> by operating the control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A control flow for raising the hydraulic pressure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. As shown in the flow chart, when the mold clamping start conditions are ready, first, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (SOLD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (SOLD <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are turned on (step <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>). Due to the foregoing, the hydraulic oil supply path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is communicated with the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is normally rotated so as to put the hydraulic pump into a discharging state (step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>), hydraulic oil is filled in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is pushed, so that the mold clamping is started. The pressure sensor <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> (PP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is arranged at the discharge port of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and monitors pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>). The sensor <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> detects that the bladder pressure has reached a setting mold clamping pressure (step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>). Then, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is turned off so as to shut off the hydraulic oil path, that is, the pressure path on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side is shut off, and at the same time the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped so that the supply of hydraulic oil by the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>). Due to the above operation, the mold clamping is completed, and then injection molding operation is executed. After the pressure path on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side has been shut off, when the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is reversed, hydraulic oil is sucked from the hydraulic oil path in the upstream (pump side) of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>). The pump discharge pressure is monitored by the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> for detecting the pump discharge pressure arranged on the entrance side of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight>). After it is detected that this pressure has become zero (step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>), the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> After the completion of molding work, the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is reduced. A control flow for reducing the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Immediately after the completion of molding work, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is closed and the pressure path on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side is shut off. In this state, the bladder pressure reducing work is started. Since the pressure before the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is different from the pressure after the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, if the hydraulic oil path is suddenly opened and hydraulic oil is returned to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, cavitation is caused which generates vibration and increases the hydraulic oil temperature. In order to prevent the occurrence of the above problems, first, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is normally rotated and the hydraulic pressure is increased to the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>). The pressure before the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and the pressure after the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are respectively monitored by the pressure sensors <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> (PP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> (PP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). After it is confirmed that the pressure before the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and the pressure after the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> have become equal to each other (step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>), the first and the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are turned on (step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>). Due to the foregoing, the hydraulic pressure oil supply path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> can be communicated with the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side. After that, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is reversed, so that the pump can be set in a sucking state (step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>). Due to the foregoing, hydraulic oil supplied to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is returned to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> via the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the occurrence of cavitation caused by a sudden pressure change can be suppressed, and an increase in the hydraulic oil temperature can be absorbed by the regenerative resistance of the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. It is checked that the pressure on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side has decreased to a value at which hydraulic oil can be released to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> without causing any problem, for example, it is checked whether or not the pressure on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side has decreased to a value lower than the setting pressure 1 MPa (step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>), and the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>). At the same time, the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is turned off (step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>). Then, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is turned off (step <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>), so that the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is communicated with the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and the residual hydraulic oil is returned to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Further, in the process of mold clamping work, the problem of a burr of resin is caused when hydraulic oil leaks out from the hydraulic circuit. In order to prevent the above problem, the hydraulic pressure is increased again. This control flow is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. It is judged whether or not the detection pressure (PP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) detected by the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> monitoring the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is decreased to lower than an allowed value of the mold clamping setting value, for example, 95% (step <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>). In the case where it is judged that the detection pressure (PP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has been decreased lower than the allowed value, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is normally rotated again so as to increase the hydraulic pressure (step <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>). At this time, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is in a closed state, and the pressure before the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is different from the pressure after the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the pressure on the upstream side of the attaching position of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is monitored by the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>). It is confirmed that this pressure is equivalent to the pressure by which the setting mold clamping force is generated (step <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>), and the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is opened (step <highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight>). While the motor is being normally rotated, a pressure increasing state of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is monitored by the bladder pressure monitoring pressure sensor <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> (PP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). When it is detected by the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> concerned that the bladder pressure has reached the setting mold clamping pressure (step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>), the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is turned off so as to shut off the hydraulic oil path, and the pressure path to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side is shut off, and at the same time the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped so that the supply of hydraulic oil by the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight>). Due to the foregoing, the hydraulic pressure is raised again. After that, the hydraulic pressure increasing work is conducted in the same manner as that of the conventional hydraulic pressure increasing work as follows. After the pressure path on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side has been shut off, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is reversed. Due to the foregoing, hydraulic oil is sucked from the hydraulic path on the upstream side (pump side) of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1314</bold></highlight>). The pump discharge port pressure is monitored at the entrance of the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. After it is detected that this pressure has become zero, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In this connection, in this embodiment, after the molding work has been completed but while the molds are being clamped as described above, the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is reduced. Then, the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are released from each other by utilizing the above swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The mold releasing work is conducted by the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In order to conduct the mold releasing work, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for moving the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the axial direction by a hydraulic force is provided. As schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is mounted on the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is connected with the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and this ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is forcibly pushed out to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> side by a hydraulic force. When the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is simply moved in the axial direction, the ball screw itself is rotated by the action of the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Therefore, while the transmission of rotation is being ensured by the spline mechanism so that the ball screw <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be moved only in the axial direction, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is attached to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> side and the rotation is prevented as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In order to operate the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> described above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, there is provided a first branch oil path <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> for introducing the pump pressure, the first branch oil path <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> branching from the hydraulic oil supply path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> at the discharge port of the pump in the hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, and there is provided a second branch oil path <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> branching from the returning oil path <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> communicating with the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> side. These oil paths are connected with the hydraulic path <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> for proceeding, which communicates with the head side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and the hydraulic path <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> for retreating which communicates with the rod side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> composed of a 4-port 3-position type changeover valve. Accordingly, when the above direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> is changed over, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is made to conduct a mold releasing motion by utilizing discharge pressure from the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and successively the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is separated from the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the mold opening operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a control flow chart of the mold releasing work in which the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, composed of this ball screw mechanism, and the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> are utilized. The control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> operates as follows. After the injection molding work has been completed, pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is reduced (step <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>). Then, the platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is operated to open the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, so that the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are unlocked from each other (step <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>). Then, the electromagnetic brake means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> attached to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is turned on (step <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>). Due to the above operation, rotation of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is restricted, and the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be moved only in the axial direction. Therefore, the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> (SOLR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) arranged in the hydraulic oil path to the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is operated (Solenoid &ldquo;b&rdquo; is turned on.), and hydraulic oil discharged from the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is introduced into the hydraulic path <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> for proceeding via the first branch hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, and the hydraulic circuit is opened so that hydraulic oil can be introduced into the head side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight>). After that, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is normally driven so that hydraulic oil can be discharged and supplied (step <highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight>). Due to the foregoing, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> pushes out the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and pushes the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the mold releasing direction while the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is being used as an engaging member. In this way, the mold releasing work can be executed. At positions to limit an advance and retreat of the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of each of a pair of mold releasing cylinder mechanisms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the position detection sensors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are respectively arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. When the position sensor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (LSD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F, LSD <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>F) to limit an advance of the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, which has been pushed out by a mold releasing motion, is turned on (step <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>), the control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> maintains the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> so that the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> can discharge a constant hydraulic pressure (step <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight>), and the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is prevented from being returned via the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this case, pressure can be kept constant when a quantity of leaked hydraulic oil is supplied. Therefore, the pump motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is rotated a little. After that, the mold opening motion is successively started. Therefore, the electromagnetic brake means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is released so as to release the restriction of rotation (step <highlight><bold>1414</bold></highlight>). Then, the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (MOTD) for opening and closing the molds is rotated in the direction of mold opening (in the reverse direction) (step <highlight><bold>1416</bold></highlight>). Whether the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has reached a mold opening position or not is detected by the position sensor arranged in the movable region of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1418</bold></highlight>). Finally, the servo motor (MOTD) for opening and closing the mold and the pump motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (MOTP) are stopped, and the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> (SOLR <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) arranged in the hydraulic oil path to the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is turned off. In this way, the work is completed (step <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> By the mold releasing control motion described above, the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is located at a position to limit an advance, however, the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> must be retreated for the next mold closing motion. The control flow for returning to the origin is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. This returning motion to the origin is conducted in such a manner that the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> located at the position to limit an advance is retreated by utilizing the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the mold as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (MOTD) for opening and closing the mold is lightly rotated in the mold opening direction at a low speed and low torque so that the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> cannot be moved (step <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>). Since the head side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is connected with the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, it is possible to retreat the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> by a low intensity force. When the sensor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (LSD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, LSD <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B) to detect the position to limit a retreat detects that the piston rod <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> has reached the position to limit a retreat (step <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>), the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (MOTD) for opening and closing the mold is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>). Then, the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> (SOLR <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is operated (Solenoid &ldquo;a&rdquo; is turned on.) to change over the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> so that the pump pressure can be introduced into the rod side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight>). Then, the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is normally driven to supply hydraulic oil to the rod side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight>) to increase the pressure. In the hydraulic path <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> for a retreat, there is provided a pressure switch <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> (PS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for detecting the pressure in the rod side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and conducting an ON operation when the pressure has reached a setting value. After the pressure in the rod side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has increased to the setting value (step <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>), the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> (SOLR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is turned off (step <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>), and the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is stopped (step <highlight><bold>1514</bold></highlight>). In the hydraulic path <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> for a retreat, there is provided a pilot check valve <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> at a position on the lower stream side of the direction control valve <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. Therefore, pressure is contained in the rod side hydraulic chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the case of opening and closing the mold, a movement of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the axial direction is strongly restricted, and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be smoothly moved for clamping the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The mold clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> composed as described above is operated as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> First, the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is in a mold opening state, is operated. When the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is rotated by driving the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for driving, the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> attached to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> side is moved while being screwed, and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is moved to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> side. At the point of time when the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is stopped. In this way, the molds can be put into a closed state. Successively, the platen lock means <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is operated as follows. A pair of split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, which are open in the case of opening and closing the mold, are closed when they are moved in the radial direction of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by the drive of the nut cylinder <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and the engaging teeth formed on the inner circumferences of the split nuts <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are engaged with the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> formed on an outer circumferential face of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this way, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be engaged with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> After the completion of accomplishing the mold closing state, the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is operated by utilizing the hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. First, the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the first and the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are turned on so as to accomplish a communicating state, that is, the hydraulic oil path is communicated so that hydraulic oil can be supplied to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Then, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is normally rotated so that the pump is put into a discharging state, and hydraulic oil is supplied to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. When hydraulic oil is charged into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, which is tightly contacted with the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> arranged inside, via the hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, since a portion of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> except for the piston contact portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is regulated by the wall face surrounding the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded onto the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> side, so that the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is pushed out and the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is pushed and the mold clamping is started. When the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> detects that the bladder pressure has reached a setting mold clamping pressure, the pressure path on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side is shut off, and the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped so that the supply of hydraulic oil by the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is stopped. Due to the foregoing, the mold clamping operation is completed, and then injection molding is conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case of opening the mold, first, the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is decreased. Therefore, the pressure of hydraulic oil contained in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is gradually decreased, so that the clamping force can be reduced. In a state in which the pressure path on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side is shut off so as to contain the pressure, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is normally rotated until the pressure is increased to an enclosing pressure, so that the pressure in the hydraulic oil path from the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is increased. After that, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is opened. Then, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is reversed so as to return hydraulic oil charged in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Due to the foregoing, the pressure of the enclosed hydraulic oil is gradually reduced and the occurrence of cavitation caused by a sudden pressure change is suppressed, and a rise of hydraulic oil temperature is absorbed by a regenerative resistance of the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. When the pressure on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side has decreased to a value at which no problems are caused even if the hydraulic oil path is open to the tank <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is stopped. Then, the first and the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are changed over, so that the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is communicated with the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and the residual hydraulic oil is returned to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Then, the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is drawn back to the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> side by a restoration force of the coned disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and a positional relation between the pressure pate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is automatically returned to a positional relation before the mold clamping force is activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which have been released from the mold clamping state, are connected with each other. In order to releasing the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the mold opening and closing means <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used. After the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have been disconnected from each other by releasing the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, hydraulic oil discharged from the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is introduced into the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which is attached so that the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be moved in the axial direction. While rotation of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is being prevented, it is forcibly pushed out to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> side by hydraulic pressure. Due to the foregoing, mold releasing is conducted. When the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is reversed, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is moved to a position at which the mold opening motion is limited, and then the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is returned to the original position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the mold clamping device of the above embodiment, the screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the electrically driven ball screw mechanism is movably supported so that it can be moved in the axial direction, and the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is provided which generates a mold releasing force by giving a force in the axial direction to the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the brake means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is arranged in the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, so that the rotation is restricted in the case of mold releasing operation to release the mold. Therefore, when both the electrically driving operation and the hydraulic operation are effectively used, energy can be saved by this mold clamping device. As hydraulic oil of the mold clamping hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is supplied to the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and especially torque is controlled by using the variable delivery piston pump, it is possible to use the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for both mold clamping and mold releasing while the device is miniaturized. The pilot check valve <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> is provided as a hydraulic pressure enclosing means in the hydraulic oil path to the mold releasing cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be held at the origin returning position, and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not vibrated in the case of a mold opening and closing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When only the pressure of hydraulic oil enclosed in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is controlled, the mold clamping force can be controlled. Therefore, it is possible to control a mold clamping force with high accuracy by utilizing the hydraulic control technique. Further, the pressurizing mechanism is so simple that the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is formed on the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> side of the mold clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is accommodated in it. Therefore, the molding work can be carried out without a failure, and the durability of the device is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In addition to that, the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is composed of the platen body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Between them, the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is arranged which is pushed out by the expanding and contracting action of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> when hydraulic pressure is introduced into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> composed of a tightly closed bag. When the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is pushed out, the mold clamping is carried out. Further, the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the shape of which is identical with the internal shape of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, is housed inside the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. When pressure is not given, the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> come into tight contact with each other, and the opening of the hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> formed in the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is closed by the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to greatly reduce a quantity of hydraulic oil. It is unnecessary to provide a quantity of hydraulic oil required for filling a volume of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, that is, it is sufficient to provide a quantity of hydraulic oil corresponding to an expanded volume for clamping the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In this pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, it possible to effectively prevent air from remaining inside the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> when hydraulic oil is supplied in the case of clamping the mold. That is, when hydraulic oil is supplied from the hydraulic circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> before clamping the mold, it is introduced from the supply hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> located under the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Then, while the hydraulic oil is flowing in the annular hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, it is charged into a plurality of hydraulic oil paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> which are communicated with the annular hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to completely bleed air, which exists in the hydraulic oil paths, through the air bleeding path <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> formed in an upper portion of the clamping mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Since the opening on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side of the hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> formed in the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is closed by the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, even if an expansion space of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be formed in an upper portion of the opening of the hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, no air remains in this portion when hydraulic oil is supplied at the initial stage. When the air bleeding path <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is closed in the above state, no bubbles stay in the mold clamping hydraulic path. Therefore, the mold clamping action can be accurately conducted with a quick response. Accordingly, when the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is used as a tightly closed bag, while the leakage of hydraulic oil to the peripheries of the metallic molds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is being prevented, it is possible to completely prevent the occurrence of a problem that the mold clamping force is not appropriately given to the metallic mold because air remains in the hydraulic oil paths. In this connection, a diameter of the supply hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> concentrically formed on the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> side directly communicated with the hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> formed in the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in this embodiment may be larger than the diameter of the hydraulic oil path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> on the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> side so that air can be smoothly bled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the protrusions <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> are integrally formed in the ear piece portions <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and engaged with the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> formed in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> so as to be fastened and fixed. Due to the above structure, even when a high hydraulic pressure is given to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> so that the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded, it is possible to prevent the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> from being disconnected from the insert die <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the leakage of hydraulic oil can be prevented. The ear piece portions <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the bladder are fastened by the fastening bolts <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> so that the thickness can be smaller than the wall thickness of the ear piece portions <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the bladder and the ear piece portions <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can be contacted with pressure. Therefore, the sealing function in the fastening portion can be accomplished by the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> itself, and it is unnecessary to provide an independent hydraulic seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> pushed against the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the cutout step portions <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are formed in the opposing portion of the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> which is opposed to the corner portion of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> made of soft material such as fiber material are attached to these cutout step portions <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. When the bladder corner portion is received by the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> made of flexible fiber woven material, it becomes possible to greatly reduce deterioration and damage of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and the durability of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Further, on the piston sliding face in the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic oil leakage inspecting oil path <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is arranged so that the leakage of hydraulic oil can be detected. Therefore, it becomes possible to detect damage to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is possible to take countermeasures before hydraulic oil leaks from the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Due to the foregoing, the mold clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made very safe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, hydraulic oil is supplied to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, which can be expanded and contracted, by the reversible motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> which is driven by the reversible motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the torque of which is controlled to be constant. Therefore, while an output of the motor is being reduced, a high intensity mold clamping force can be generated. After the mold clamping force has been generated, the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is reversed and then stopped. Therefore, unnecessary hydraulic oil can be returned to the tank, and the heat of the hydraulic oil, the temperature of which has been raised by the pressurizing action, can be absorbed by a regenerative resistance of the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> According to a signal to start a decrease in pressure after the completion of injection molding, the control means <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> operates as follows. While the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is previously closed, the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is normally rotated so as to supply hydraulic oil. After pressure has been adjusted so that the pressure before the contained position and that after the contained position are equivalent to each other, the first solenoid valve <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is opened and the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is reversed, and hydraulic oil is returned to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> side via the swash plate type pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in the case of decreasing pressure, pressure of hydraulic oil is gradually decreased, so that the occurrence of cavitation caused by a sudden pressure change can be suppressed and an increase in the temperature of hydraulic oil can be suppressed when generated heat is absorbed by the regenerative resistance of the motor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Since the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is used in the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to safely protect the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> from damage. When the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is reversely compressed by the injection pressure, the internal pressure of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is abnormally raised. In this case, the relief valve <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel with the second solenoid valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, which is always open and arranged in the return oil path <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, is operated, and an open flow path to the tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is formed so that pressure can be released. When pressure is abnormally raised on the pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> side or when the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is excessively moved, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is damaged. In this case, the by-pass control valve <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> arranged in the by-pass oil path <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> provided on the delivery side of the pump is quickly opened. Therefore, it possible to prevent the scatter of hydraulic oil caused when the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to the drawings, another embodiment of the pressurizing mechanism of the clamping device of the present invention will be explained in detail as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is vertically arranged on one end of the machine base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while the base portion of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fixed by means of a key. On the other hand, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is capable of proceeding and retreating with respect to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is vertically arranged being opposed to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is arranged at a step portion in the through-hole <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> formed at a corner of the vertical plane of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An axial end of the ball screw member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having the screw portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> screwed with the ball nut <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is concentrically connected with an output shaft of the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is arranged on an upper face of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for opening and closing the mold. When the servo motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is controlled so that it can be rotated normally or reversely, the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> proceeds to or retreats from the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> being integrated with the guide shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attached to the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be opened and closed with respect to the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> One end of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which penetrates the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> used as a metallic mold attaching plate to which the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached, is connected with the end plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a predetermined interval and fixed by the lock piece <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> cannot be rotated. The screw portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at the other end of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is screwed with the tie rod nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The tie rod nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes the tie rod nut rotary member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rotated by the servo motor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via a belt. Further, the tie rod nut presser metallic piece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which is arranged in a step portion of the tie rod nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is fixed to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by bolts. In this way, a space can be ensured in which the tie rod nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> surrounded by the tie rod nut presser metallic piece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> On an outer circumferential face in the middle of the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, there are provided a plurality of ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, on an inner circumferential face of the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> arranged on an end face of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is opposite to the side on which the metallic mold is attached, there is provided an internal circumferential protrusion capable of engaging with an appropriate portion of the ring grooves <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As described above, while the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are being moved so that they can be opened and closed, the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is held in a state in which it is split to halves. However, when the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are closed and then the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is closed by operating the air cylinder <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, the inner circumferential protrusion of the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is engaged in the ring groove <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, so that the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be engaged with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As described above, in order to maintain the engaging state of the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, when the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are closed to each other, a position of each ring groove <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> must agree with an appropriate position at which the ring groove <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> engages with the inner circumferential protrusion of the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in the case where the metallic molds are replaced, it is necessary to conduct a die-height adjustment in which the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is moved in the axial direction according to the metallic mold thickness (die-height) before the molding operation is started so that the ring groove <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be engaged with the inner circumferential protrusion of the split nut <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the mold clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, when four tie rod rotary members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are rotated being linked with each other in the case of adjusting the die-height, the four tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are moved in the axial direction with respect to the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the length of each screw portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> protruding outside the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is changed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28, a</cross-reference> bold arrow represents a motion of the tie rod in the case of adjusting the die-height. As shown by the bold arrow, when the tie rod nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is rotated, the tie rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> itself is not rotated but is moved in the axial direction by the distance corresponding to an adjustment of the die-height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Next, explanations will be made into a mechanism by which a mold clamping force is given to the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which have been closed to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> At the center of the vertical face of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the side opposite to the tie rod nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> side, there is provided a cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, the shape of which is a recess having a bottom portion. On the bottom side of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, there is provided a bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> made of flexible material, having a hollow hydraulic chamber inside. Further, on the opening side of the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, there is slidably provided a piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the forward end of which is a pushing face. The bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is enclosed in a space formed by the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> without leaving any gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the above piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, an end face of the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> on the side opposite to the side facing the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is connected with the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> penetrate the tie rod holes formed at four corners of the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached at the center of the vertical face of the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> on the side opposite to the side on which the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is arranged. Further, in the large diameter portion of each of a plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> having a step portion which is formed on the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from the side on which the metallic mold is attached, there is provided a coned disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The bolt <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> connecting with the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> via the coned disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> penetrates the small diameter portion of the through-hole <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and screws with the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, hydraulic oil can be filled into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> from the oil tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by the pump <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. A force to push the back face of the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> generated by the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> expanded by the internal pressure is transmitted to the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> as a mold clamping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when hydraulic oil enclosed in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is returned to the oil tank <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> side via an appropriate changeover valve (not shown) so as to reduce the pressure in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, positions of the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be automatically returned by a restoration force of the cone disc spring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to the initial positions before the mold clamping force was given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> When pressure of hydraulic oil enclosed in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> accommodated in the cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> formed on the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the mold clamping device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as an injection molding machine or die-casting machine is controlled as described above, a mold clamping force given between the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is interposed between the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the movable metallic mold <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be controlled in the mold clamping mechanism. In cooperation with the aforementioned ball screw drive type mold opening and closing mechanism, it is possible to provide a clean mold clamping device characterized in that: the energy saving property is high; the control accuracy is excellent; the structure is simple; and the durability is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, the pressurizing mechanism of the mold clamping device of the present invention will be explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 28</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the square pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the rod holes at the four corners of which are slidably engaged with the tie rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, is put on the vertical plane of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, being capable of coming into contact with and separating from the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The cylinder portion <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is provided on a face of the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opposed to the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. This cylinder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is open to the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In this cylinder portion <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, there are provided a bottom plate <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. In this cylinder portion <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, there is provided a hydraulic pressure introducing port <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> penetrating the bottom plate <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. In this way, the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the mold clamping device is composed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the pressurizing mechanism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of this mold clamping device includes: a circular cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> attached to the cylinder portion <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> by being fixed by bolts; and a piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> slidably engaged in an internal hole of the cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. A lower portion of this piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is capable of sufficiently coming into contact with the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> arranged in a lower portion when the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded. Hydraulic oil is introduced into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> via the hydraulic pressure introducing port <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> formed on the bottom plate <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. Pushing force F generated by hydraulic oil in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is smoothly transmitted to the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and a mold clamping force can be given to between the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the movable platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> used for this embodiment is made of a flexible oil proof rubber such as nitrile rubber, acrylic rubber, silicon rubber and fluororubber. Although the thickness of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> depends upon the diameter of the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, it is preferable that the thickness is determined to be 2 to 5 mm. In this embodiment, the compact bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is arranged coming into contact with the stationary platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and hydraulic oil is enclosed in the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to give a mold clamping force to the stationary metallic mold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the pressure plate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Especially when hydraulic oil is supplied to and discharged from the inside of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</cross-reference>, in the case of the tightly closed bag <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the prior art, a portion of the corner of the tightly closed bag <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> intrudes into a gap between the platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the ram <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> due to the expanding and contracting motion of the tightly closed bag <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the above phenomenon, this portion of the tightly closed bag <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which has intruded into the gap between the platen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the ram <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, gradually becomes fragile when the bag is expanded and contracted. Accordingly, there is a possibility that the tightly closed bag <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is damaged in the process of operation of an injection molding or die-casting machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above problems, according to the present invention, the following countermeasures are taken as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</cross-reference>. In order to prevent the corner of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> from intruding into the gap between the cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the cutout step portions <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the cross sections of which are formed into an L-shape, are formed in the outer circumferential portion of the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> on the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> side, and the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and the backup ring <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight>, which are protective material members, are inserted and arranged being put on each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, concerning the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, for example, a ring-shaped member, into which tetrafluoroethylene fibers are woven, is arranged adjacent to the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. When the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> composed as described above are used, before hydraulic pressure is introduced into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>A, since the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is not expanded, clearances L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are maintained between the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> or between the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>B, when hydraulic pressure is introduced into the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded and pushes the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. Therefore, clearance L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> between the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> becomes zero, and clearances L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which are the upper and lower side clearances and the right and left clearances, also becomes zero. When the ring-shaped member, into which Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) fibers are woven as described above, is used, the above clearances are filled with the ring-shaped member when the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is expanded. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the occurrence of such a phenomenon that a portion of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is inserted into the clearance by the expansion of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is finally damaged. Since the piston rings <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> are soft, the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> made of rubber is seldom damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, when the piston ring <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> having the reinforcing portions <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at four corners or one corner is used as a protective material member, collapse of the profile of the piston ring <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> can be prevented. Therefore, the closeness of clearances L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be enhanced. At the same time, it becomes possible to prevent the corner of the piston ring <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> from intruding into gap S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it possible to protect the piston ring <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> from damage and, further, it possible for the piston <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to be smoothly reciprocated. Furthermore, it is possible to omit to arrange the backup ring <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight>, which results in the reduction of the manufacturing cost. In this connection, in this embodiment, the shape of the bladder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is not restricted to the specific embodiment. It is possible to adopt the ring shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. Further, it is possible to attach a plurality of circular bladders shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the present invention, the pressurizing mechanism is composed in such a manner that when a bladder, into which hydraulic oil can be introduced, arranged in a cylinder, is expanded and contracted, a piston can be pushed out. An insert die, the shape of which is identical with that of the internal shape of the bladder, is housed in the bladder. A hydraulic path is formed in the insert die. A ball screw member of the electrically driven ball screw mechanism is supported being capable of moving in the axial direction. A break means for restricting rotation is provided in the ball screw member. A mold releasing cylinder mechanism for generating a mold releasing force in the axial direction is connected with it. A hydraulic pressure supply source is used in common between this mold releasing cylinder mechanism and the aforementioned bladder, and when a hydraulic oil path is changed over, the mold releasing cylinder mechanism can be operated. Therefore, it is composed in such a manner that hydraulic oil is supplied to the bladder in which the insert die is housed. Accordingly, a quantity of oil to be supplied for clamping the mold can be minimized. When the molds are once clamped, the drive of the hydraulic source can be stopped. Therefore, while energy saving is being sufficiently realized, it is possible to exhibit a high intensity of clamping force by a compact device. In the case of releasing the molds, it is unnecessary to activate hydraulic pressure given to the mold clamping pressurizing mechanism. A mold releasing operation is conducted by the mold releasing cylinder arranged in the electrically driven ball screw mechanism used for opening and closing the molds. In this case, the hydraulic pressure supply source used for clamping the molds is used in common. Therefore, the apparatus can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a recessed space is provided in the neighborhood of the outer circumference of the piston, and the seal member composed of the soft piston ring and the hard backup ring is inserted into this space. Accordingly, when the bladder is expanded and contracted in the cases of supplying and discharging hydraulic oil, there is no possibility that the bladder is inserted into the gap. Therefore, the durability of the bladder is greatly enhanced, and the reliability of the device can be greatly improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In this connection, a specific embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail here. However, variations may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
