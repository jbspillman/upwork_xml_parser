<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Raney alloy catalysts applied to a support are described, said catalysts having an extremely thin layer of Raney alloy with a thickness of 0.01 to 100 &mgr;m.

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of heterogeneous catalysis. More precisely, the present invention relates to heterogeneous catalysts based on Raney alloys applied to knitted or woven fabric tapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Raney alloys as they are known, especially Raney nickel, have been known for a long time as heterogeneous catalyst systems. They are used for hydrogenations or dehydrogenations. These alloys are intermetallic phases, for example, in the case of Raney nickel, phases with the composition Ni<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or NiAl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Conventionally these alloys are used in the form of fine powders suspended in the solution in which the reaction is carried out. The aluminum is dissolved out by treatment with lyes to give a very active Ni catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Raney nickel, in particular, is a very active catalyst for hydrogenations or dehydrogenations, although there are a number of disadvantages arising from the powder form of the catalyst. Thus, one is often confronted with problems of catalyst distribution in the reactor; also, the residence times of the reactants in the reactor are frequently critical. In addition, when the reaction is complete, the powder has to be separated off, generally by filtration, which demands an elaborate and expensive work-up technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For this reason, attempts have been made to prepare fixed bed catalysts which contain typical Raney nickel alloys, but not in powder form. In the simplest case, shaped articles are produced from the fine suspension powders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This is described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,799, where an alloy powder is mixed with polyethylene and a binder and compressed to shaped articles in screw extruders. In the subsequent calcination step, the required intermetallic phases are formed and the polyethylene is burnt off at the same time to give solid strands which are suitable as a hydrogenation catalyst, especially for the hydrogenation of toluene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another possibility is to prepare catalysts in which a Raney alloy surface is applied to a woven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This is described for example in EP-A-91 028, which discloses catalysts with fabric components having an integrated Raney nickel surface. These catalysts are prepared by providing nickel-containing fabrics with an aluminum layer, the latter preferably being applied by immersing said fabrics in aluminum melts at 600 to 700&deg; C. The aluminum layer has a thickness of at least 100 &mgr;m, preferably 150 &mgr;m. The catalysts are used in the hydrogenation of aromatic amines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In &ldquo;Commercial Application of Cathode Coatings in Electrolytic Chlorine Cells&rdquo;, T. A. Liederbach et al. describe the production of nickel electrodes in the form of wire gauzes or sheets by electroplating. In this process, nickel and zinc are deposited electrolytically from a solution containing ions of these metals. Electrodes of similar performance characteristics are obtained from metal powders by the plasma spray process. Typical thicknesses of the catalytically active layer are 250 to 300 &mgr;m. Electrodes of this type are employed in chlor-alkali electrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> DE-A-37 02 138 discloses electrodes produced from Raney nickel powders. These powders are intimately mixed with another alloy, used to store H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and with poly-tetrafluoroethylene powder. The resulting mixture is processed to a coherent network by compression and rolling. An alternative possibility is to compress the mixture onto an expanded metal to give electrodes with a layer thickness of 1 mm. These electrodes are used for the storage and electrochemical scission of hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 481,440 describes a Raney nickel electrode applied to a graphitized paper support. This support is coated by plasma coating with alloy powder to give layers with a thickness of 1 to 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The Raney nickel catalysts described in the prior art generally exhibit a high hydrogenating activity, but their abrasion resistance is inadequate for some uses. This is the case, for instance, when colorless, optically clear liquids of high viscosity are subjected to hydrogenation or dehydrogenation reactions using Raney nickel catalysts. This often reveals abrasion originating from the Raney alloy catalyst. Depending on the type of this catalyst, the abraded material can be coarsely to finely particulate, as is the case for powder catalysts and catalysts obtained by the electrochemical deposition of metals. Even in the case of 1 mm thin layers on woven fabric, the abrasion of very fine particles is still observed, which may not be tolerable for all product requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide Raney alloy catalysts which have a high hydrogenating activity and an extremely high abrasion resistance, even on contact with viscous liquids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> We have found that this object is achieved by Raney alloy catalysts applied to a support, wherein the Raney alloy layer has a thickness of 0.2 to 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The catalyst generally takes the form of tape, film, woven fabric or knitted fabric. These catalyst tapes are preferably coated by electron beam vaporization under reduced pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Different metals can be used according to the desired Raney alloy. Aluminum is used in every case. The other metal needed to prepare a Raney alloy is selected from the group consisting of nickel, cobalt and copper, nickel being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> If desired, the metals can additionally contain one or more promoter metals, for example iron, chromium, molybdenum or boron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To coat the support materials, the active component, i.e. aluminum, and the other metal used to prepare the desired Raney alloy, especially nickel, as well as the promoter metal if desired, are vaporized under reduced pressure and condensed uniformly onto the support. The vaporization is effected by the conventional methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by means of heat, by electron beam vaporization, by sputtering or by combinations of these methods. The coating is preferably carried out by electron beam vaporization. The condensation is preferably effected by the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,202 or EP564 830. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The resulting layers of vapor-deposited metal are extremely thin, being in the range 0.1 &mgr;m to 50 &mgr;m, preferably 1 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m, in the case of aluminum. The layer thicknesses of the other metals used to prepare the Raney alloy depend on the stoichiometry of the active Raney phase to be prepared. In the case of nickel, the metal layer has a thickness of 0.1 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m, preferably 0.5 &mgr;m to 5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The support can be coated in such a way that several layers of the metals used are applied alternately. Total layer thicknesses of approx. 100 &mgr;m are achieved in this way. These layer thicknesses are well below those achievable by the processes described in the prior art, which have values of about 100 to 15,000 &mgr;m. The catalysts according to the invention therefore have metal layers with an extremely low total weight ranging from approx. 1 to 20 g aluminum/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>fabric or 1 to 3 g nickel/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>fabric. These values also apply to cobalt and copper. The specific total weight of the resulting metal layers from which the Raney alloy is formed ranges from 0.1 to 10 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The support materials used are preferably metals, one reason for this being their advantageous mechanical properties. Another advantage, however, is the fact that they can be roughened prior to coating. This is effected by surface tempering, for which the metal supports are heated in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, for example air, over a period of 30 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 1 to 10 hours, the temperatures used being from 700 to 1100&deg; C., preferably 800 to 1000&deg; C. It has been found that the activity of the catalyst can be controlled by this kind of pretreatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Metals which are preferably used as support materials are stainless steels of material no. 1.4767, 1.4401, 2.4610, 1.4765, 1.4847 and 1.4301 (designation according to &ldquo;Stahleisenliste&rdquo;, 8th edition, pages 87, 89 and 101, published by Verein deutscher Eisenh&uuml;ttenleute, Verlag Stahleisen mbH, D&uuml;sseldorf 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Other preferred metals for production of the support materials are iron, nickel or copper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However, the list of materials suitable for the support is not restricted to metals. Inorganic materials or dielectrics can also be used instead of metals to produce the supports, examples being ceramic, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, preferably woven fabric made of asbestos substitutes, or combinations of these materials. Carbon fibers are also suitable. Organic plastics can also be used, examples of such materials being polyamides, polyesters, polyvinyl compounds, polyethylene, polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene. All these non-metallic materials are used in a similar way to the metals in the form of knitted fabrics, woven fabrics or films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The catalyst tapes obtained by the process according to the invention have a metal layer consisting of the appropriate Raney alloy, which is completely homogeneous and forms neither pores nor particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Said materials are used as supports in the form of films, knitted fabrics or woven fabrics. In one preferred embodiment, the supports are corrugated or crimped, for example by gear rolling. The corrugations obtained preferably have a pitch of 0.5 to 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The catalyst tapes obtained after coating still have to undergo a heat treatment in order to be able to form the active Raney alloy phases. In the case of Raney nickel, these phases can be expressed approximately by the formula Ni<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or NiAl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The heat treatment is carried out at temperatures of 500 to 600&deg; C. for 10 to 60 minutes under an inert gas atmosphere, examples of possible inert gases being nitrogen, argon or hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one variant of the invention, finished Raney alloys, preferably Raney nickel, can be vapor-deposited directly onto the support, thereby dispensing with the tempering step. The Raney nickel layer is preferably prepared by sputtering with a roll coater, the layer thicknesses of the resulting Raney alloys ranging from 1 &mgr;m to 50 &mgr;m and the preferred thickness being 1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The catalysts obtained according to the invention, applied to films or woven or knitted tapes, can be formulated by the conventional techniques into packings or monoliths which can advantageously be used in hydrogenations or dehydrogenations. A large number of different packing structures are known from distillation and mixing technologies, an example being canal structures for gas-liquid exchange. Such structures are described for example in EP-A-482 145 and WO 97/02890. Monolithic packings of this type can be produced to particular advantage with the catalyst fabrics according to the invention, whose particularly abrasion-resistant, ultrathin layers allow them to be mechanically transformed into any desired shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The supported catalysts according to the invention can easily be activated. At low temperatures, preferably of 20&deg; C. to 40&deg; C., the aluminum can be dissolved out with 1 to 20% lye, generally NaOH, to expose the active alloy phase. The treatment with lye is only carried out over a short period, preferably of 1 to 20 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By virtue of their abrasion resistance, the supported catalysts according to the invention are particularly suitable for the hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of viscous liquids on which there are high demands in respect of purity and optical clarity. It has been found that the catalysts according to the present invention are particularly suitable for improving the color index of polyhydric alcohols by hydrogenation. It is particularly preferred to employ the catalysts according to the invention in the process disclosed in the German patent application entitled &ldquo;Improving the color index of polyhydric alcohols by hydrogenation&rdquo;, reference no. 199 63 442.4 (Applicant: BASF AG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The patent application will now be illustrated in greater detail in the Examples below:</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A woven wire fabric made of material no. 1.4767, with a mesh size of 0.18 mm and a wire diameter of 0.112 mm, was annealed in air at 900&deg; C. for 3 hours. After cooling, the support fabric roughened in this way was then vapor-plated on both sides in an electron beam vaporization unit, initially at 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>Torr, first with a 0.2 um thick layer of aluminum and then, under the same conditions, with a 0.044 &mgr;m thick layer of nickel. This process was repeated continuously until the total layer thickness reached 1.2 &mgr;m. After the tempering step for 3 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere, two monoliths with a height of 200 mm and a diameter of 21.5 mm were formed from the catalyst fabric. This was done by taking one smooth strip of fabric and one strip of fabric which had been corrugated beforehand by means of a gear roller, combining them, rolling them up and fixing them together by spot welding along the outside edge. The monolithic Raney nickel film catalyst obtained was placed in a 60 cm long reactor tube, where it was treated for 15 minutes with 10% sodium hydroxide solution, which was then removed by washing with water. </paragraph>
