<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H05-257613, there is disclosed a hard-disc drive apparatus (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;conventional apparatus&rdquo;) which comprises a plurality of read/write heads arranged such that the hard disc is divided equally in order to shorten the read/write time of the hard disc and also to shorten the time required for reading/writing a plurality of tasks and/or the random access time to each track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More specifically, this conventional apparatus comprises a control mechanism, a main buffer for reading/writing, two read/write heads A and B and sub-buffers each provided for a respective one of the heads. In the following, description will be made of an exemplary sequence for changing the operations of both heads in the conventional apparatus for the case where the operating condition in which the head A is writing into the disc with the head B reading from the disc is to be change, in response to a changeover request from the outside, to another condition in which the head A is in the read mode with the head B being in the write mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. The control mechanism transmits to the head A a command for stopping writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Upon receiving the write stop command, the head A returns an acknowledgement of receipt of the stop command to the control mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3. The control mechanism waits for the acknowledgement of receipt from the head A. If the acknowledgement of receipt of the write stop command is not received, the control mechanism retransmits the write stop command to the head A. If the acknowledgement of receipt of the write stop command is not received from the head A in spite of retransmitting the write stop command a predetermined number of times, the control mechanism carries out an error processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 4. The control mechanism calculates the number of data transmitted to the write sub-buffer of the head A so far and, when the number has reached the end of one record, stops the transmission of data from the main buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 5. The head A continues the writing operation until the data it has written reaches the end of one record. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 6. Since it is prohibited to change the write mode to the read mode during the writing operation, if a head mode change command is transmitted from the control mechanism, that command will be rejected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 7. When the data have been written up to the end, the head A stops the writing operation and transmits to the control mechanism those numbers of the track and the sector, where the head A wrote the data last, together with the start location of the data remained unprocessed in the write main buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> 8. The control mechanism echoes the received data back to the head A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 9. The head A receives the acknowledgment of receipt of data from the control mechanism, cancels the condition of rejecting the change of mode if the (echoed) data is correct, and informs the control mechanism of the cancellation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 10. If the echoed data contains an error, the head A again transmits to the control mechanism a command for retransmitting echo data. If the data thus retransmitted has not been corrected, this writing operation is treated as an error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 11. When a signal indicating that the condition of rejecting the change of mode has been cancelled is received from the head A, the control mechanism transmits, to the head A, a mode change command from the write mode to the read mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 12. The head A returns to the control mechanism an acknowledgment of receipt of the mode change command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 13. The control mechanism checks the retuned command and, if it contains an error, retransmits the mode change command to the head A. If the command again returned still contains an error, the mode change command is processed as an error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> 14. The control mechanism transmits to the head B a command for stopping reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> 15. Upon receiving the read stop command, the head B returns an acknowledgement of receipt of the stop command to the control mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 16. The control mechanism waits for the acknowledgement of receipt of the read stop command from the head B. If the acknowledgement of receipt of the read stop command is not received, the control mechanism retransmits the read stop command to the head B. If the acknowledgement of receipt of the read stop command is not received from the head B in spite of retransmitting the read stop command a predetermined number of times, the control mechanism carries out an error processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 17. The head B performs the read operation until the data it has read reaches to the end of one record while calculating the number of data read so far and checking the amount of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 18. After the read operation ends, transmission of new data from the read sub-buffer associated with the head B to the read main buffer is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> 19. Since it is prohibited to change the read mode to the write mode during the read operation, if a head mode change command is transmitted from the control mechanism, that command will be rejected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> 20. When the data have been read up to the end of one record, the head B terminates the read operation and transmits to the control mechanism those numbers of the track and the sector, where the head B read the data last. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 21. The control mechanism echoes the received data back to the head B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 22. The head B receives the acknowledgment of receipt of data from the control mechanism, cancels the condition of rejecting the change of mode if the (echoed) data is correct, and informs the control mechanism of the cancellation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 23. If the echoed data contains an error, the head B again transmits to the control mechanism a command for retransmitting echo data. If the data thus retransmitted has not been corrected, this read operation is processed as an error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 24. When a signal indicating that the condition of rejecting the change of mode has been cancelled is received from the head B, the control mechanism transmits to the head B a mode change command from the read mode to the write mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 25. The head B returns to the control mechanism an acknowledgment of receipt of the mode change command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 26. The control mechanism checks the retuned command and, if it contains an error, retransmits the mode change command to the head B. If the command again returned still contains an error, the mode change command is processed as an error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 27. The control mechanism confirms the fact that the operation modes of the head A and B have been changed over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 28. The control mechanism informs the head A of those numbers of the track and sector where reading should be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 29. The head A copies the data thus read to the read main buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 30. The reading operation is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 31. The control mechanism informs the head B of those numbers of the track and sector where writing should be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 32. The head B copies the specified data from the write main buffer to the write sub-buffer associated with the head B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> 33. The writing operation is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the conventional hard-disc drive apparatus in order to carry out reading and writing with the two (i.e., the read and write) heads, in addition to the above-mentioned sequential processing of the lower level, a further sequential processing of the higher level must always be carried out, in which further sequential processing the track and sector at which writing is currently performed and the track and sector at which reading is currently performed are recognized, the track and sector at which reading must be performed next and the track and sector at which writing must be performed next are searched from a FAT (File Allocation Table), and these four values are then compared to determine what type of operation each of the head A and B must perform. One example of the higher level sequential processing is the shortest-time processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The shortest-time processing will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. It is here assumed that the rotary magnetic disc is rotating clockwise. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the situation in which the head A is writing into the sixth record (first track, seventh sector) as indicated by hatching whereas the head B has finished reading of the third record (first track, fourth sector). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For the processing to be performed next, there will be the following possibilities a and b: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> a. The head A is moved to the third track to read the fourth record at the fifth sector, and the head B is moved to the fourth track to perform writing into the seventh record at the eighth sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> b. The head A is moved to the fourth track to perform writing into the seventh record at the eighth sector, and the head B is moved to the third track to read the fourth record at the fifth sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the shortest-time processing, a calculation must be carried out in advance to determine which of the above operations a and b will be finished within a shorter time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the user requests a special feature (e.g., a fast slip replay) to be performed, further processing which cannot be dealt with by such a simple comparison-based operation as that for the above-mentioned shortest-time processing will be needed. In such processing, it will be necessary to constantly examine whether or not the fast replay has overtook the recording, and, if it has, a more complicate control must be performed to deal with the plurality of heads which have the functions of switching between reading and writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In sum, the conventional hard-disc drive apparatus has to perform the read and write operations in correspondence with each of a huge number of combinations which are different in accordance with the locations of records to be accessed for reading/writing, the positions of the head A and B, the modes of operation of the heads A and B, and the special features. To implement this, the convention hard-disc drive apparatus must be provided with such a complicated and expensive read/write change control mechanism for which a control program composed of a huge number of program steps as well as a dedicated IC of a high processing speed must be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in an information processing system provided with an information recording apparatus which reads files on an external storage medium such as a CD-ROM and MO, when a file of the external storage medium in which a virus program lies concealed is activated with the information recording apparatus of the information processing system being in operation, the virus program is executed, with the result that the information processing system may be destroyed. Conventionally, in order to avoid such destruction, viruses are removed in advance by means of vaccine software designed to remove virus programs. However, since new viruses constantly appear there exists no perfect vaccine software which can remove every virus program. In addition, any vaccine software currently available needs to be updated to its newest version always. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there have been and are arising serious problems that home pages of governmental offices and companies are illegally altered by hackers. Conventionally, intrusions of hackers into a home page have been prevented by the provision of a firewall. However, hackers somehow create new techniques which are not rejected by such firewall, intrude into the server system for the home page and alter the contents of the home page which are stored in its hard-disc drive apparatus. Therefore, even when a firewall is provided and it is reinforced, there is a certain limit in preventing illegal intrusions into the home page by such firewall. In other words, in the conventional system, once the firewall is breached the system administrator has no means to counteract the hacker any longer. This is because the storage device in the conventional server system has only one read/write head used, so that the hacker can alter the home page if she/he has managed to reach the head. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an information recording apparatus which can obviate the need for such a control program composed of a huge number of program steps and a dedicated IC of a high processing speed which have been needed in the conventional hard-disc drive apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an information processing system which is prevented from destruction by a virus program read from storage medium, such as a CD-ROM, which contains such virus program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide an information processing system in which it is made impossible for a malicious third person to intrude thereinto from the outside through an external network to alter information stored in the storage device of the server system, or to surreptitiously read mails in the mailbox or alter the log files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An information recording apparatus according to the present invention is characterized by comprising a writable disc, a hard-disc drive section for driving the disc, a first head for reading data from and writing data into the disc, a first head drive section for driving the first head, a first head control circuit for controlling the first head, a first input/output channel connected to the first head control circuit, a second head for reading data from the disc, a second head drive section for driving the second head, a second head control circuit for controlling the second head and a second input/output channel connected to the second head control circuit, wherein the first head and the second head are driven independently of each other. In the recording apparatus according to the invention, the second head is arranged to be for the exclusive use for reading, the complicate and expensive mechanism for controlling read/write switching of the conventional hard-disc drive apparatus can be dispensed with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In an information processing system which comprises the above-described information recording apparatus, a first computer connected to the first input/output channel and provided with an external storage device, and a second computer connected to the second input/output channel, and in which the first head is arranged so as to be able to perform both reading and writing but the second head is arranged so as to be able to perform reading only, when the second computer executes a file which may have been infected with a virus, an effect will appear on the operation thereof if the file has indeed been infected but the virus cannot damage the files on the writable disc. When the effect of the infection with the virus appears, virus checking should be done. When a virus is found in this checking, the first computer removes the relevant files which have been written in the disc and the external storage device. Consequently, an information processing system which can be prevented from destruction by a virus program read from storage medium such as a CD-ROM is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> An information processing system according to one aspect of the present invention comprises a writable disc, a disc drive section for driving the disc, a first head for reading data from and writing data into the disc, a first head drive section for driving the first head, a first head control circuit for controlling the first head, a first input/output channel connected to the first head control circuit, a second head for reading data from and writing data into the disc, a second head drive section for driving the second head, a second head control circuit for controlling the second head, a second input/output channel connected to the second head control circuit, a first computer connected to the first input/output channel and a second computer connected to the second input/output channel, wherein the first head and the second head are driven independently of each other and wherein the first computer is connected to an external network. In this information processing system, the first head and the second head are driven independently of each other, that is to say, a malicious third person cannot reach the second head even when she/he can penetrate this system from the external network, so that the information (the home page, mails and so on) maintained and managed by the second computer will never be destroyed or altered by the malicious third person by means of the second head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With the information processing system wherein the first head is exclusively for reading, any malicious third person penetrating from the external network cannot perform writing, so that the security of this information processing system is more robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> With the information processing system wherein the first head is a head provided exclusively for writing into an empty area of the disc, users entering this system from the external network can only perform writing, so that this system is suitable for use as an e-mail system or the like.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An information processing system according to another aspect of the invention comprises a writable storage device, a first input/output channel coupled to the storage device for exclusively performing reading from the storage device, a second input/output channel coupled to the storage device for performing reading/writing with respect to the storage device, a first computer connected to the first input/output channel and a second computer connected to the second input/output channel, wherein the first input/output channel and the second input/output channel are driven independently of each other and wherein the first computer is connected to an external network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this information processing system, the external network is not coupled to the second input/output channel while the first input/output channel and the second input/output channel are driven independently of each other, so that a malicious third person cannot reach the second input/output channel even when she/he penetrates this system from the external network. Thus, it is impossible for malicious third persons to destroy and/or alter the information (the home page or the like) as maintained and managed by the second computer by means of the second channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Since the first input/output channel is a read-only channel with respect to the storage device, malicious intruders cannot perform writing into the storage device even by means of the first computer.

Thus, it is impossible for malicious third persons to destroy and/or alter e-mails and/or access logs which are maintained and managed by the second computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Since the first input/output channel is a write-only channel for exclusively writing into empty areas of the storage device, malicious intruders cannot perform reading from the storage device nor overwriting the records existing in the storage device. As a result, the security of this information processing system becomes quite robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In an information processing system which is reliable and relatively cheap, the writable storage device comprises a writable disc, a head for reading data from and writing data into the disc, a head drive section for driving the head, a head control circuit for controlling the head, and a processing circuit connected to the first input/output channel and the second input/output channel for processing read/write requests from the first input/output channel and the second input/output channel, the processing circuit supplying results of the processing to and receiving information from the head control circuit. In this information processing system, for example, a hard disc, a DVD-RAM or a magneto-optical disc can be used as the writable disc. These discs are currently the most popular and widely used storage media, so that the information processing system utilizing such writable disc is relatively cheap and reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An information processing system in which the writable storage device is constituted by an electronic circuit is excellent in the life time and reliability by virtue of the absence of movable parts such as a disc drive device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An information processing system in which the security has been further enhanced as compared to the above-described information processing systems comprises, in addition to the structure of the above-described information processing system, a writable second storage device, a write-only third input/output channel coupled to the second storage device for carrying out only writing into an empty area of the second storage device, and a fourth input/output channel coupled to the second storage device for performing reading/writing with respect to the second storage device which are all connected between the first computer and the second computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The information for the home page of the system administrator is written by the second computer through the second input/output channel into the first storage device, and maintained and managed therein. When an external user attempts to read the home page thus stored in the first storage device, the first computer reads the home page information from the first storage device using the first input/output channel and supplies it to the user through the external network. When an external user wishes to write a mail through the external network into this system, the first computer writes the mail of the user through the third input/output channel into the second storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Only connected to the first computer which is connected to the external network are the first input/output channel which can only read the contents of the first storage device and the third input/output channel which can only write into the second storage device at an empty area where no mail nor access log has been written. In other words, the first computer connected to the external network is not connected to the second computer which maintains and manages the home page and mails. Therefore, even if a malicious third person intrudes through the external network into this system and succeeds in fully controlling the first computer, she/he will not be able to reach the second computer, so that this malicious third person cannot stealthily read or alter the arrived mails, alter the access logs or alter the home page by means of the second computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Since the first input/output channel is a read-only channel for the first storage device, a malicious intruder cannot perform writing into the first storage device even by means of the first computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the third input/output channel is a write-only channel for writing only into an empty area of the second storage device, a malicious intruder cannot read from the second storage device nor overwrite the existing records in this device.

Therefore, even when this second computer executes a file containing a virus, the contents of the first record area will not be altered and thus this information processing system will not be destroyed. On the other hand, the second computer cannot read the second record area, so that it will never happen that this second computer reads any virus program written into the second record area. Thus, even when a program containing a virus is executed, the second computer will not alter any file in the first and second record areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> An information processing system according to a still further aspect of the invention which is suitable for use as a server for a home page and mails comprises a disc having a plurality of record areas, at least one head for performing reading/writing with respect to the disc, two or more input/output channels connected to the head, a first computer connected to one of the input/output channels (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;first input/output channel&rdquo;), and an second computer connected to another one of the input/output channels (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;second input/output channel&rdquo;) and connected to a network, </paragraph>

In addition, the second computer cannot write into the first record area, so that it is impossible for the hacker to alter and/or delete the programs/data of the home page stored in the disc. Rewriting of the programs/data of the home page is performed by the head connected to the first computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Mails which are written by users on the network into the second record area are copied by the first computer to the first record area.

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> An information recording apparatus according to the present invention comprises, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such as a hard disc and a DVD-RAM, a disc drive section for driving the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for reading data from and writing data into the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for reading data from the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven by a first head drive section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, while the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is driven by a second head drive section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by a first head control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is connected to a first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is controlled by a second head control circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is connected to a second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (having no write function). Thus, the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is for performing reading and writing, but the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is exclusively for reading. Furthermore, each one of the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> independently carries out the control, drive and input/output of data with respect to the outside irrespective of the position and operation mode of the other head. The information recording apparatus according to the invention applies to each head the numbers of the sector and track where reading/writing should be done and comprises for each head a buffer for the data to be read/written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The operation of the information recording apparatus according to the invention will now be described. It is assumed here that, for the recording of a film program of TV broadcast, the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been recording the program on the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from one hour ago. When the user wishes to view the film program under recording from the beginning, the user gives the information recording apparatus a corresponding command. In response to this command, the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> locates the track and sector numbers corresponding to the beginning of this film program from its buffer, moves to the position on the disc corresponding to these numbers and starts, from that position, reading the file to be read (i.e., the film program which the first head has written). This reading operation is different from the conventional way of reading files in that the file which has been written by the first head is incomplete. This problem can be dealt with during the processing of the reproduced data by examining the data as read by the second head itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> When the second head carried out the read operation at the same speed as the write operation of the first head, the reading position by the second head will not catch up with the writing position by the first head, so that the recording and the replay can be performed simultaneously but independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When the reading position by the second head has overtaken the trailing end position of the file which the first head is writing as a result of the fast replay, it will be possible to detect this condition from the data read by the second head itself. What can be detected from such data may, for example, be the fact that the pointer to the next record has no value or that an End of file has been reached, in response to which the second head can stop reading or change itself to the read operation at the same speed. In the above situation, even if the second head continues the read operation, only meaningless reading will follow. The user can then manually stop the operation to remove such situation. The second head is a head which is exclusively for reading and operable completely independent of the first head, so that even when the reading portion by the second head passes the writing portion by the first head, this fact will have no effect on the write operation of the first head. That is to say, since the first and second heads can thus operate independently of each other, the information recording apparatus according to the present invention does not need a device for changing the operations of the first and second heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An information processing system according to an embodiment of the invention to which the above information recording apparatus has been applied will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The information processing system according to this embodiment is constituted by the information recording apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (the portion encircled by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), a first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and an external storage device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which is connected to the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and enables reading/writing, for example, of a floppy disc, a CD-R or a CD-ROM. The second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> connected to the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not allowed to perform writing. Thus, although the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can both read and write, the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can only read. Furthermore, each one of the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> independently carries out reading and writing irrespective of the position and operation mode of the other head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Description will now be made of the fact that, even when necessary files are read from the external storage device such as a CD-ROM in which a virus program lies concealed, this computer system constructed as described above will not be destroyed by the virus program. First, it is assumed that the necessary files are read from the CD-ROM containing the concealed virus program by means of the external storage device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and then copied to the hard disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. An infection of a computer system with a virus means the fact that a file existing therein is altered (that is to say, the file is rewritten). In this embodiment, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can only read the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for execution (i.e., cannot write thereinto). Therefore, even when the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> executes the file containing the above virus, the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will not be rewritten, and thus the computer system will not be destroyed. When the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> executes a file which may have been infected with a virus, an effect will appear on the operation thereof if the file has indeed been infected. In such a case, virus checking should be done. When a virus is found in this checking, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> removes the relevant files which have been written in the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the external storage device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. If no virus has been found, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> executes the relevant files. In that case, since the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can perform reading/writing with respect to the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a full execution of the program is possible. Thus, this information processing system is prevented from the destruction by the virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the structure of another information processing system provided in accordance with the present invention. This information processing system comprises a writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such as a hard disc, a hard-disc drive section for driving the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for reading data from and writing data into the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and having a security function, a first head drive section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for mechanically moving the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a first head control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for carrying out a control such that the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> performs reading/writing, a first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected to the first head control circuit, a second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for reading data from and writing data into the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a second head drive section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for mechanically moving the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a second head control circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for carrying out a control such that the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> performs reading/writing, a second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> connected to the second head control circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this case, the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are driven independently of each other, while the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to a network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as a public line and an in-house LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The operation of this information processing system will now be described. In the first place, description will be made of the case where the system is used for the maintenance and/or management of a home page. In this case, the system administrator of the home page carries out reading/writing of information for the home page with respect to the disc through the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> using the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a third person who wished to read this home page reads information relating to the home page in the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Let us consider a case where a malicious third person tries to alter the home page stored in the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this case, the computer connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the head connected to this computer is the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the malicious third person succeeds in fully controlling the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> she/he cannot reach the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> connected to the second computer, so that the malicious third person cannot destroy nor alter the home page and/or the mails in a way in which the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> When the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is for exclusive use for reading, a user entering this information system from the external network cannot write into the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the security of this information system is more robust than the information system just described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Description will now be made of the operation of the information processing system in which the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a write-only head exclusively for performing writing into empty areas of the disc. This information system is suitable for the maintenance and management of e-mails. First, a case where an external user writes an e-mail through the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be described. The e-mail of this user is written into the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the system administrator reads that e-mail thus written in the disc by means of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> using the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, checks it for virus or the like and then stores it in an e-mail mailbox provided on a local disc or the like which is separate from the above disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the system administrator erases the mail, which has thus been stored, from the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> using the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The recipient of this e-mail who uses the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can open the e-mail mailbox on the local disc of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and read the mail addressed to her/him. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When a malicious third person attempts to surreptitiously read a mail which has been written from the external network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, she/he will not succeed since such a mail which has been written by an authorized user is stored in the local disc connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Even if the malicious third person tries to read the mail before it is moved to the local disc, she/he cannot read the contents of the mail since the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is for exclusive use for writing in an empty area and is thus not able to perform reading. Thus, the malicious third person cannot read nor destroy the existing mails by the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the security of this system is quite robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> An information processing system provided with two writable discs in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This information processing system is formed by adding, to the structure of the first embodiment between the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a second disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a hard-disc drive section for driving the second disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; for carrying out reading/writing with respect to the second disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a third head drive section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; for driving the third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, a third head control circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; for carrying out a control such that the third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; performs reading/writing, a third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;, a fourth head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; for performing reading/writing with respect to the second disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a fourth head drive section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; for mechanically moving the fourth head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;, a fourth head control circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; for carrying out a control such that the fourth head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; performs reading/writing and a fourth input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; connected to the fourth head control circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the above structure, the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is exclusively for reading while the third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; is a write-only head for performing writing only into empty areas on the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;. The second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the fourth head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; are for reading/writing as in the first embodiment. The first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for reading/writing and the fourth head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; for reading/writing are connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The principle of operation of this information system will now be described. The information for the home page of the system administrator is maintained and managed by the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the information necessary therefor is written in the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the second head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When a user attempts to read the home page stored in this system, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> reads the home page with the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and provides it to the user through the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, mails of external users are maintained and managed by the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in a manner similar to that described above for the first embodiment. When a user writes a mail in this system through the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> writes the mail of that user into the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; with the third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;. The mail thus written is moved to a local disc of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> With this system, even when a malicious third person intrudes into this system via the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and fully controls the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, this malicious third person cannot perform alteration and/or surreptitious reading of the mails which have already arrived, alteration of the access logs, alteration of the home page or the like. This is because only connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are the first head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which can only read the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the third head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; which can only perform writing into empty areas of the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> writes into the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> information, for example, for the home page which is to be presented to the outside, and also reads out of the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; information, for example, of those mails which the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> received from the outside and then moves the information thus read to the mailbox present on the separate local disc for example. Although the information read from the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; should carefully be checked for possible destroying functions contained therein, such treatment may be limited to those destructions which will be brought about through mails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the structure of an information processing system provided in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. This information processing system comprises a writable storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, first and second input/output channels <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> coupled to the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to an external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as the Internet and an intranet. The first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged as a channel exclusively for performing reading from the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or a channel exclusively for performing writing into an empty area of the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in dependence on the application of this information processing system. The first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are driven independently of each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The operational of this information processing system will now be described for the case where the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a read-only channel for the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This information processing system will be suitable for the maintenance and/or management of a home page. The system administrator of the home page carries out reading/writing of information for the home page with respect to the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> using the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a third person who wished to view this home page reads the home page in the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Let us consider a case where a malicious third person tries to alter the home page stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> but not connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the malicious third person succeeds in fully controlling the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> she/he cannot reach the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, so that the malicious person cannot destroy nor alter the home page stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of the second computer unless she/he can control this second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Also, since the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a read-only channel, a user entering this information system from the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> cannot perform writing into the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> even by means of the first computer. Thus, the security of this information system is quite robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Description will now be made of the operational of the information processing system in which the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a write-only channel exclusively for performing writing into empty areas of the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This information processing system is suitable for the maintenance and management of e-mails. When an external user writes an e-mail through the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the e-mail of this user is written into the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the system administrator reads that e-mail thus written in the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, checks it for virus or the like and then stores it in an e-mail mailbox provided on a local disc or the like which is separate from the above storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. After the e-mail has thus been stored in the mailbox, the mail stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is erased by means of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A user who uses the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can open the e-mail mailbox in the local disc of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and read the mail addressed to her/him. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In this manner, mails written by authorized users are stored in the local disc connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Since it is impossible for a malicious third person to reach the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, she/he cannot stealthily read the mails stored in the local disc. Even if the malicious third person tries to stealthily read or alter the mail written in the storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> before it is moved to the local disc, she/he cannot read nor overwrite the contents of the mail since the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a write-only channel for writing into an empty area where no mail has been written. Thus, malicious third persons cannot read nor destroy the existing mails, so that the security of this system is robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> An information processing system which is provided with two writable storage devices will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This information processing system is provided, in addition to the structure of the information processing system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and between the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, with a second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;, a third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; coupled to the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; and a fourth input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; coupled to the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;. The first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is exclusively for reading from a first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, while the third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is a write-only channel for performing writing only into empty areas of the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;. The second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the fourth input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; are channels for reading/writing as in the information processing system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for reading/writing and the fourth input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; for reading/writing are connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The operational of this information processing system will now be described. The information for the home page of the system administrator is written into the first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and maintained and managed by the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. When an external user wishes to read the home page stored in this first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> reads the home page with the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and provides it to the user through the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, mails of external users are stored, maintained and managed in the mailbox on a local disc by the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in a manner similar to that described above for the information processing system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. When a user sends a mail to this system through the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> writes the mail of that user into the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; through the third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;. The mail thus written is moved to the mailbox on the local disc of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Only connected to the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which can only read the contents of the first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; which can only perform writing into those empty areas of the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; in which no mail nor access log have been written. In other words, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not connected to the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which maintains and manages the home page and mails. Therefore, even when a malicious third person intrudes into this system via the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and fully controls the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, she/he cannot reach the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, so that this malicious third person cannot perform alteration and/or surreptitious reading of the mails which have already arrived, alteration of the access logs, alteration of the home page or the like by means of the second computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Since the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a read-only channel for the first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a malicious intruder cannot perform writing into the first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> even by means of the first computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the third input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is a write-only channel for writing only into an empty area of the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;, a malicious intruder cannot read from the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; nor overwrite the existing records in this device. Consequently, the security of this system is quite robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> writes into the first storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> information, for example, for the home page which is to be presented to the outside. Further, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> reads out of the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; information, for example, of those mails which the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has received and written into the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;, and moves the information thus read to the mailbox present on the separate local disc for example. Although the information, such as mails, read from the second storage device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; should carefully be checked for possible system-destroying programs contained therein, such checking needs to be performed only for those programs transmitted via mails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> When the storage devices <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; are constituted each by an electronic circuit such as a semiconductor integrated circuit, it becomes possible to realize an information processing system which is compact and reliable by virtue of the absence of movable parts such as a writable disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A storage device for the information processing system which comprises a writable disc will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The writable storage device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises a writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for reading data from and writing data into the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a head drive section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for driving the head, a head control circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for controlling the head, and a processing circuit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. This processing circuit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is connected to the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and processes read/write requests from the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. This processing circuit supplies the results of the processing to the head control circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and receives information therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> An information processing system in which the writable disc has a plurality of record areas will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This information processing system comprises a hard disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, heads <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for performing reading/writing with respect to the disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, two or more input/output channels <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> connected to the heads, a first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to one of the input/output channels (the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and a second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to another one of the input/output channels (the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). The hard disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of record areas <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to which respective operation modes can be set independently of each other. The second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to an external storage device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which enables reading/writing of a disc such as a CD-R and a CD-ROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an arrangement is made such that the following relationship is established between the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, on the one hand, and the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, on the other hand. First, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to be able to perform reading and writing of data with respect to any of the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by means of head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected to the first input/output channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to be able to perform reading of data but unable to perform writing of data with respect to the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by means of the head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> connected to the second input/output channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is further arranged so as to be unable to perform reading of data and only able to perform writing of data in an adding fashion with respect to the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Description will now be made of the fact that, even when necessary files are read from a CD-ROM in which a virus program may lie in a concealed manner, this information processing system constructed as described above will not be destroyed by the virus program. First, it is assumed that the necessary files are read from the CD-ROM containing the concealed virus program by means of the external storage device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and then recorded on the disc in the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As a matter of course, the virus program is recorded in the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> copies the files recorded in the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and containing the virus program to the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> An infection of an information processing system with a virus means the fact that a file existing therein is altered (that is to say, the file is rewritten). Therefore, if the record area in which a file has been recorded is not rewritable, then the file will never be altered. In this embodiment, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can only read the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (i.e., cannot write thereinto). Therefore, even when the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> executes the file containing the above virus, the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> will not be rewritten, and thus this information processing system will not be destroyed. On the other hand, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> cannot read the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and therefore it will never happen that the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> reads the files written in the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Consequently, even when the program containing the virus is executed, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can rewrite neither the files in the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> nor the files in the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Thus, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can execute the file containing the virus without damaging the files written in any of the first and second record areas <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and examine its behavior. Based on the results, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> makes a check to determine whether there is a virus in the written file. If a virus is found, the relevant files written in the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are removed. If no virus is found, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> executes the relevant files. In that case, since the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can perform reading/writing with respect to any of the record areas <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a full execution of the program is possible. Thus, this information processing system is prevented from the destruction by the virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> An information processing system suitable for use as a server for a home page and mails will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. This computer system is different from the above-described embodiment in that the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected a network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as the Internet. The second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may further be connected to an external storage device which enables reading/writing of a disc such as a CD-R and CD-ROM. An arrangement is also made to establish the same relationship as that in the above-mentioned embodiment between the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, on the one hand, and the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, on the other hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is suitable for storing data for open information such as a home page. It is here assumed that a hacker on the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has gained the root privilege of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in an effort to alter the data of the home page or the like recorded on the hard disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can only read the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and cannot read the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In addition, the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> cannot write into the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and therefore it is impossible for the hacker to alter or delete the programs and/or data of the home page which have been written in the hard disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Rewriting of the programs and/or data in the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is performed by means of the head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected to the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is suitable for relaying mails of the users on the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A mail written into the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by a user on the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is copied by the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Since the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can read files in the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a user on the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can read mails recorded in the first record area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and addressed to her/him. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can not only read data from but also write data into the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, whereas the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> cannot read data from the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and can only add data thereto. Therefore, the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is also suitable for storing closed information such as cipher keys, passwords and addresses. Third persons on the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as the Internet cannot read data from the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, so that such information will not leak out. When the system administrator wishes to change the information, such change will be made by means of the head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected to the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> It is here assumed that a mail or home-page information with a virus has been written into the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It may then be possible that the contents of the memory of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are destroyed directly by the virus. When it is detected, based on an abnormal operation of the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, that the memory contents have been destroyed, the first computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> deletes that mail containing the virus from the second record area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and has the second computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> restarted. By this operation, this information processing system will be prevented from being destroyed by the mail containing the virus and sent through the network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the embodiments described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the information processing system comprises the hard disc provided with two heads <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. However, the number of heads should not necessarily be two, but only one head may suffice. In the following, description will be made on an information processing system of such structure with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the information processing system comprising a hard disc with a single head, a head control device <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is additionally provided. The structure of this information processing system in other respects is the same as those of the embodiments described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. The head control device <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> carries out such a control that the single head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has functions of two independent heads in a time sharing manner. For example, the head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is caused to function as a first head in a first time period and then function as a second head in a second time period following the first time period, thereafter such operation being repeated. According to this structure, functions of a plurality of heads can be realized with a single head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In any of the above-described information processing systems, a hard disc, a DVD-RAM, a magneto-optical disc or the like can be used as the writable disc <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. These discs are the most popular and widely used storage media at present, so that the information processing system utilizing such writable disc is relatively cheap and reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may not only be the Internet but also be a LAN or an intranet. In the case of an intranet, such information which may be open to the employees but is prohibited from alteration can be treated in a safe manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include any transmission medium such as an analog telephone line, an ISDN telephone line, a DSL, a CATV line, an optical fiber, Ethernet, 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, an infrared signal and a radio wave signal. </paragraph>
