<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of transplanting a transplant derived from a donor into a recipient is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of (a) transplanting the transplant into the recipient; and (b) administering to the recipient a dose including non-alloreactive anti-third party cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), wherein the non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs are generated by directing T-lymphocytes of the donor against a third party antigen or antigens, the dose is substantially depleted of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs, thereby preventing or ameliorating both graft rejection by the recipient and graft versus host disease. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to veto cell preparations, methods of their manufacture and transplantation method using same which can be used to prevent or ameliorate immune rejection of donor organs, tissues or cells without inducing graft versus host disease (GVHD). More particularly, the present invention relates to a cell preparation for use in transplantation which preparation includes cells which are functional as veto cells but which are substantially devoid of alloreactive cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Transplantation of allogeneic and xenogeneic organs, tissues and cells is commonly practiced in humans in order to alleviate numerous disorders and diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, bone marrow (BM) transplantation is increasingly used to treat a series of severe diseases in humans, such as for example, leukemia. However, bone marrow transplantation is limited by the availability of suitable donors, since transplanted tissues must traverse major histocompatibility barriers which can otherwise lead to graft rejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In view of such limitations, several approaches for enhancing graft acceptance have been suggested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one approach, cancer patients receiving autologous BM transplantation were treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), resulting in mobilization of pluripotential stem cells from the marrow to the blood thereby increasing the number of cells which can be collected for autologous transplantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another approach, major histocompatibility barriers in BM transplantation in leukemia patients were overcome by using a very large dose of stem cells, preferably a dose at least 3-fold greater than conventional doses used in T-cell-depleted BM transplantation, in particular a megadose of CD34&plus; hematopoietic progenitors (U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,529 to Reisner et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although the megadose approach facilitated permanent acceptance of allogeneic donor type skin grafts in mice<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, such an approach is not readily applicable for human transplantation since the number of stem cells which are required to attain this desirable goal may not be easily collected from human donors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A difficult barrier for the engraftment of donor hematopoietic cell transplantation arises from the marked level of host hematopoietic and immune cells surviving mild preparatory regimens. Several studies have shown that this challenge can be successfully addressed in rodents by using large doses of bone marrow cells, adequately depleted of T-cells and utilized in conjunction with one form or another of tolerance inducing cells, also termed as veto cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Veto cell activity is defined as the capacity to specifically suppress cytotoxic T-cell precursors (CTL-p) directed against antigens of the veto cells themselves, but not against third party antigens<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>Several veto cells or bone marrow transplantation facilitating cells capable of suppressing cytotoxic T-cell precursors have been described<highlight><superscript>3-11 </superscript></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Interestingly, it has been shown that some of the most potent veto cells are of T-cell origin, and in particular a very strong veto activity was documented for CD8&plus; CTL lines or clones<highlight><superscript>12-16</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The specificity of CTL veto cells was demonstrated by several studies to be unrelated to their T-cell receptor specificity<highlight><superscript>17-19</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The suppression of effector CTL-p directed against the veto cells is both antigen-specific and MHC-restricted. This suppression results from the unidirectional recognition of the veto cell by the responding cytotoxic T-lymphocytes<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>. Furthermore, it has been shown that this suppression is mediated by apoptosis<highlight><superscript>18, 20</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Blocking experiments conducted with anti-CD8 or anti class I antibodies indicated that the elimination of host anti-donor CTL-p is induced via an interaction of CD8 molecules on the CTL veto cells with the a3 domain of class I molecules on the host CTL-p&apos;s<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>. Support to this observation was provided by studies in which CD8 eDNA was introduced into clones lacking CD8<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>. Further support was provided by experiments which demonstrated that CD8 molecules on the veto cells can directly induce apoptosis in effector cells<highlight><superscript>21</superscript></highlight>. More recently, Asiedu et al. demonstrated that antibody mediated cross linking of CD8 on primate bone marrow veto cells, leads to an increased TGF&bgr; production which induces apoptosis in the effector cells<highlight><superscript>22</superscript></highlight>. Alternatively, it has been suggested that mouse bone marrow veto cells can induce apoptosis via Fas-Fas-L interaction<highlight><superscript>23</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The studies described hereinabove demonstrated that veto T-cell preparations can greatly facilitate graft tolerance in bone marrow transplantation. However, the veto T-cell preparations are inadequate for generating graft tolerance since such preparations still include a substantial amount of alloreacting donor T-cells which can lead to GVHD, thus limiting the successful implementation of this approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Reisner et al., <highlight><superscript>24</superscript></highlight>, <highlight><superscript>28 </superscript></highlight>describe the preparation of non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs which can be used to enhance graft acceptance in mice. However, following the publication of this abstract and a more careful study, it was realized that the CTL preparation described therein is not depleted of T-cells capable of developing post transplantation into anti-host CTLs inflicting GVHD. Thus, this approach per se is not applicable for application in humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a novel veto cell preparation devoid of alloreactivity which can be used for substantially reducing rejection of transplanted organs, tissues or cells without generating GVHD, thereby leading to durable tolerance towards the transplanted, organs tissues or cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The present invention is of veto cell preparations, methods for their production and their use in transplantations, which veto cells can be used to induce durable tolerance of donor organs, tissues or cells without inducing GVHD. Specifically, the present invention relates to veto cell preparations for use in transplantation, which veto cell preparations include cells which are functional as veto cells but which are substantially devoid of alloreactive cells and as such, when introduced into a recipient, these veto cells prevent graft rejection without inducing GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Early studies in murine models and more recent clinical data in heavily pre-treated Leukemia patients have shown that escalation of hematopoietic progenitor cells can overcome major genetic barriers and enable rapid and durable engraftment of haploidentical 3-loci mismatched transplants without inducing GVHD. In vitro studies suggest that veto cells within the CD34 progenitors population likely mediate this facilitating effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;megadose&rdquo; concept was also shown recently to be useful for tolerance induction in sublethally irradiated mice by overcoming the marked resistance presented by the large number of lymphocytes surviving the sublethal conditioning. Allogeneic chimera generated by transplantation of a megadose of Sca1<highlight><superscript>&plus; Lin</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> cells, permanently accept allogeneic donor type skin grafts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> However, the numbers required to attain this desirable goal may not be easily collected from human donors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Non-alloreactive, Peanut Agglutinin negative thymocytes from (host&times;donor) F1 which are non-alloreactive by virtue of their genetic composition, were also shown to enhance engraftment of T-cell depleted BM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> More recently these cells were shown to synergise with murine Sca1<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Lin<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> cells so as to reduce the minimal number of cells required to achieve induction of substantial mixed chimerism in the sub lethal mouse model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In humans, non-alloreactive T-cells can be generated by purging interleukin-2 receptor (CD25) MLR reactive T-cells or by anergy induction upon incubation with CTLA-4. However, these approaches, which make use of T-cell stimulation with the very antigens against which tolerance is desired, might involve some risk for generating committed CTLs, if any of the CTL progenitors escape deletion or anergy induction. Once such anti-host CTLs are generated, it is very difficult to suppress their alloreactivity in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> An alternative approach is based on earlier studies which showed that CD8<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> CTL clones possess extremely high veto activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Donor derived T-lymphocytes exposed to a third party antigen proved useful in generating CTLs effective in preventing or ameliorating graft rejection, however, such CTL preparations included a substantial fraction of donor derived T-lymphocytes which could develop into alloreactive donor CTLs, inducing GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thus, all prior art approaches which utilize veto cells of T-cell origin fail to provide adequate solution for inducing graft acceptance since such veto cell preparations include a substantial amount of alloreactive T-cells which induce GVHD in the host following administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> While reducing the present invention to practice, donor anti-third party CTLs which are depleted of anti-host alloreactivity were generated. In the preferred embodiments of the invention cell preparations are also substantially depleted of CD4 T cells and/or CD56 natural killer cells, preferably both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As is further described in Examples 1 and 2 of the Examples section below, depletion of cells having a potential of becoming alloreactive (anti-host) CTLs from a donor anti-third party CTLs culture involved, in the specific example provided, initial IL-2 starvation which resulted in apoptosis of non-induced T-cells present in the culture. Studies utilizing such mouse and human CTL preparations which were performed in-vitro, demonstrated that such non-alloreactive CTL preparations are depleted of cells having the potential of maturing into anti-host CTLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of transplanting a transplant derived from a donor into a recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As used herein the terms &ldquo;transplant&rdquo; or &ldquo;graft&rdquo; refers to either allogeneic or xenogeneic transplants or grafts including, but not limited to whole organs, such as for example, kidney, heart, liver or skin; tissues, such as, for example, tissues derived from an organ such as a liver; or cells, such as, for example, immature hematopoictic cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;allogeneic&rdquo; refers to as being from the same species. As such an &ldquo;allograft&rdquo; is a transplant between two individuals of the same species which individuals display strong (unrelated individuals) or weak (haploidentical siblings) histocompatibility differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As used herein the terms &ldquo;xenogeneic&rdquo; or &ldquo;heterogeneic&rdquo; refer to as being from two different species. As such a &ldquo;xenograft&rdquo; or a &ldquo;heterograft&rdquo; is a transplant between two individuals of a different species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thus, the method according to the present invention, which is further described and exemplified hereinbelow, can be utilized for transplantation of an organ such as a kidney or a heart to a recipient suffering from, for example, renal or heart failure, or for the transplantation of liver, lung or skin tissue to a recipient suffering from hepatic or lung failure or skin damage (e.g., burns). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The method described below can also be used, for example, for treating a recipient suffering from a disease requiring immature hematopoietic cell transplantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the latter case, immature allogeneic or xenogeneic hematopoietic cells (including stem cells) which can be derived, for example, from bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood (by for example leukapheresis), fetal liver, yolk sac and/or cord blood of the donor and which are preferably T-cell depleted CD34<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> immature hematopoietic cells, can be transplanted to a recipient suffering from a malignant disease. Such a disease can be, but is not limited to, leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) or chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), and severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes (SCID), including adenosine deaminase (ADA), osteopetrosis, aplastic anemia, Gaucher&apos;s disease, thalassemia and other congenital or genetically-determined hematopoietic abnormalities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the transplant type, to avoid graft rejection, the method according to the present invention also utilizes a novel veto cell preparation which includes non-alloreactive anti-third party cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Such CTLs are generated by conditioning donor derived T-cells against third party antigens. This CTL cell preparation functions in reducing graft rejection by the recipient. Further detail of such a CTL preparation is given in Examples 1-3 of the Examples section. Such preparations are depleted of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs, thereby preventing or ameliorating both graft rejection by the recipient and graft versus host disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As used herein the phrase &ldquo;non-alloreactive&rdquo; refers to having substantially no reactivity against the donor or recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> According to the method of the present invention, these CTLs are administered either concomitantly, prior to, or following the transplantation of the donor transplant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the case of hematopoietic cell transplantation, the cell ratio between the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and the immature hematopoietic cells including stem cells is at least 1 to 100, preferably, in the range of 1 to 1-5 to 1, more preferably about. Preferably, the cell number of the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes infused to a recipient is more than 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/Kg body weight and the immature hematopoietic cells including stem cells (CD34 cells) is more than 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/Kg body weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As used herein the phrase &ldquo;third party antigen or antigens&rdquo; refers to antigens which are not present in either the donor or recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For example, third party antigens can be antigens of viruses, such as for example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cyto-megalo virus (CMV) or of third party cells (cells not from the donor or recipient). Viral antigens can be presented by cells (e.g., cell line) infected therewith or otherwise made to express viral proteins. Autologous antigen presenting cells can be used to present short synthetic peptides fused or loaded thereto. Such short peptides may be viral derived peptides or peptides representing any other antigen. Dedicated software can be used to analyze viral or other sequences to identify immunogenic short peptides, i.e., peptides presentable in context of class 1 MHC or class 1 MHC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Third party cells can be either allogeneic or xenogeneic with respects to the recipient. Preferably, in the case of allogeneic third party cells, such cells have HLA antigens different from that of the donor but which are not cross reactive with the recipient HLA antigens, such that CTLs generated against such cells are not reactive against transplant or recipient antigens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the allogeneic third party cells are stimulatory cells selected from the group consisting of cells purified from PBL, spleen or lymph nodes, cytokine-mobilized PBLs and in vitro expanded antigen-presenting dendritic cells (APC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Third party antigens can be presented on the cellular, viral or bacterial surfaces or derived and/or purified therefrom. Additionally, a viral antigen can be displayed on an infected cell and a cellular antigen can be displayed on an artificial vehicles such as a liposome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In addition, third party antigens can, for example, be proteins extracted or purified from a variety of sources. An example of a purified protein which can serve as a third party antigen according to the present invention is ovalbumin. Other examples are envisaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the CTLs are preferably generated against third party cells or viruses or virally infected or viral peptides presenting cells and as such, the third party antigens utilized by the present invention are various native cellular or viral antigens or a combination of both which are displayed on the surface of the cell or virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Utilizing cells, viruses, virally infected or viral peptides presenting cells as third party antigens is particularly advantageous since such third party antigens include a diverse array of antigenic determinants and as such direct the formation of CTLs of a diverse population, which may further serve in faster reconstitution of T-cells in cases where such reconstitution is required, e.g., following lethal or sublethal irradiation procedure. Furthermore, when CTLs are directed against viral infected cells, it is plausible to obtain at least some graft versus cancer cells activity due to cross reactivity between viral antigens and cancer cell associated or specific antigens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Thus, as already mentioned above, the method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by transplanting the transplant into the recipient along with a non-alloreactive anti-third party cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) depleted of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs, thereby preventing or ameliorating both graft rejection by the recipient and graft versus host disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Since the non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs are generated by directing T-lymphocytes derived from the donor against third party antigen or antigens, the resultant CTLs prevent or ameliorate graft rejection by the recipient by trapping and killing recipient CTL progenitors (responders) which are formed against the transplant. Furthermore, since the CTLs are generated against third party antigens, such CTLs are not active against recipient tissues or against the donor transplant. Since the anti-third party CTLs are depleted of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs, they prevent or ameliorate graft versus host disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the method of transplanting a donor transplant further includes an additional step in which the recipient is conditioned under sublethal, lethal or supralethal conditions prior to transplantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Such conditioning is dependent on the nature of the transplant and the condition of the recipient. The recipient may be conditioned under sublethal, lethal or supralethal conditions, for example, by total body irradiation (TBI) and/or by treatment with myeloablative and immunosuppressive agents according to standard protocols. For example, a sublethal dose of irradiation is within the range of 1-7.5 Gy TBI, a lethal dose is within the range of 7.5-9.5 Gy TBI and a supralethal dose is within the range of 9.5-16.5 Gy TBI. Examples of myeloablative agents are busulphan, dimethyl mileran and thiotepa, and of immunosuppressive agents are prednisone, methyl prednisolone, azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, fludarabin, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> According to the method of the present invention, the recipient is preferably conditioned under sublethal conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As already stated numerous times, the non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs according to the present invention are substantially depleted of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs, and are therefore said to be &ldquo;non-alloreactive&rdquo;. As such they differ and are advantageous over prior art veto cells. Depletion of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs is of particular advantage since the presence of alloreactive cells in the recipient can lead to the development of GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs cell preparation is generated as described above by directing donor derived T-lymphocytes against third party antigens and the preparation is depleted of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention the depletion of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs is effected by depriving T-lymphocytes cultured in the presence of third party antigens of a factor which is (i) required for CTLs maturation or protection from apoptosis; and (ii) secreted by maturing CTLs. Under such culturing conditions T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs undergo apoptosis, wherein maturing CTLs present in the culture survive factor deprivation since such cells self secrete (autocrine) this factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The factor according to the teachings of the present invention can be for example, a cytokine, such as, but not limited to, IL2. IL2 depravation of CTL preparations is described in detail in Examples 1-3 of the Examples section below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, depletion of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs is effected by affinity labeling followed by label based separation. Thus, when stimulated against host antigens ,a fluorescently labeled anti-CD69 or anti-CD25 antibody which specifically binds the unique activation antigen of T-lymphocytes and/or a fluorescently labeled anti-IL2 or anti-&ggr;INF which specifically binds cells secreting these cytokines, can be used to separate anti-host T-lymphocytes from anti-third party CTLs, thereby deplete T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs. Such specific labeling can be used to select anti-third party CTL precursors prior to IL-2 starvation or as a substitute for IL-2 starvation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Such specific labeling can be used to select anti-third party CTL precursors prior to IL-2 starvation or as a substitute for IL-2 starvation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> According to still further features in the described preferred embodiments depletion of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs is effected by affinity purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> For example, a substrate including an antibody or a ligand capable of specifically binding a cell surface molecule displayed only by T-lymphocytes but not by CTLs or vice versa, can be used to effectively deplete T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs from the CTL preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The affinity substrate according to the present invention can be a column matrix such as, for example agarose, cellulose and the like, or beads such as, for example, magnetic beads onto which an anti-T-lymphocyte or an anti-CTLs antibody, as is described above, is immobilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to this aspect of the present invention, depletion of T-lymphocytes capable of developing into alloreactive CTLs, can be effected via column chromatography or magnetic bead separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The purpose in growing donor T cells sensitized against third party antigen or antigens is to achieve a T cell preparation depleted of alloreactive clones directed against host antigens. As is described herein, the procedure includes two major steps. In the first, IL-2 starvation is used to effect partial depletion of cells which cannot produce their own IL-2, in the second major step anti-third party clones are expanded vigorously with optimal doses of IL-2 so as to further deplete remaining anti host clones. In is general, CD8 CTLs are directed against antigens presented in the context of HLA class I, while CD4 helper T cells recognize antigens in the context of HLA Class II. The latter cells lack veto activity and therefore the procedure described herein leads to minimal generation of such cells. However, it was experimentally found that even when using stimulation protocols favoring generation of CTLs against third party antigens, it is difficult to achieve high levels of CD8 CTLs at the end of the culture, unless CD4 T cells and CD56 natural killer (NK) cells are removed 10-16 days after the IL2 starvation period (e.g., prior to stimulation with high levels of IL-2). Thus in a preferred embodiment of the present invention CD8 cells purification is effected by either negative selection for removing CD4 and CD56 cells or by positive selection with for retaining CD8 cells. Such selection can be effected, for example, using affinity solid supports including anti-CD8 antibodies (for positive selection) or anti-CD4 antibodies and anti CD56 antibodies (for positive selection). The solid support can be a column, beads or magnetic beads. Alternatively, such selection can be effected, for example, using affinity labeling followed by FACS separation employing fluorescently labeled anti-CD8 antibodies, anti-CD4 antibodies and/or anti CD56 antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> According to yet an additional aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of transplanting a transplant derived from a donor into a recipient. The method according to this aspect of the present invention is identical to the method described hereinabove with the exception that the veto cells utilized are of non T-lymphocyte origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A veto cell preparation according to this aspect of the present invention, includes donor derived, genetically modified non-T-cells expressing recombinant Fas ligand and recombinant CD8 antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As is described in Example 2 of the Examples section, while reducing the present invention to practice it was uncovered that CTLs can veto effectively CTL progenitors only if both Fas-L and CD8 are co-expressed on the former CTLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As such, donor derived non-T-lymphocyte circulatory cells, such as, for example, monocytes, neutrophilles or basophilles, can also serve as effective veto cells provided these cells express and display CD8 and Fas-L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> To express these proteins in such cells, the coding sequences of Fas-L and CD8 subunit o (Gene Bank accession Nos.: U11821 and M12825, respectively, both are incorporated herein by reference) including appropriate leader sequences are isolated and each is ligated into a suitable expression cassette of an expression vector construct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The vector constructs can then be co-introduced into the cell by any one of a variety of methods known in the art. Such methods can be found generally described in Sambrook et al., &ldquo;Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual&rdquo;, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989, Ausubel et al., &ldquo;Current Protocols in Molecular Biology&rdquo;, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Md., 1989, Chang et al., &ldquo;Somatic Gene Therapy&rdquo;, CRC Press, Ann Arbor, Mich., 1995, Vega et al., &ldquo;Gene Targeting&rdquo;, CRC Press, Ann Arbor Mich. (995), &ldquo;Vectors: A Survey of Molecular Cloning Vectors and Their Uses&rdquo;, Butterworths, Boston Mass., 1988, and Gilboa et al., Biotechniques 4 (6): 504-512, 1986, and include, for example, stable or transient transfection, lipofection, electroporation, biolistic bombardment and infection with recombinant viral vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Each nucleic acid construct according to this aspect of the present invention includes a promoter for regulate the expression of Fas-L or CD8. Such promoters are known to be cis-sequence elements required for transcription as they serve to bind DNA dependent RNA polymerase which transcribes sequences present downstream thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The promoter of choice that is used in conjunction with this aspect of the invention can be any promoter suitable for expression in mammalian cells. Preferably the promoter utilized is a strong, constitutive promoter capable of expressing high levels of the transcripts. In addition, to further increase transcriptional activity the vector construct of the present invention may also include a transcriptional enhancer element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The vector construct according to this aspect of the present invention preferably further includes an appropriate selectable marker. It will be appreciated that since two independent constructs are utilized herein, each construct includes a unique selectable marker, such that cell transformed with both constructs can be selected for. Alternatively, a single vector harboring both genes, each with its own expression regulatory sequences, is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The vector construct according to the present invention preferably further includes an origin of replication in mammalian cells and an appropriate selectable marker and origin of replication for propagation in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(i.e., shuttle vector). The vector construct of the present invention can be utilized for transient expression (i.e., no genomic integration), or for integration into the genome of transformed cells and expression therefrom. The construct according to this aspect of the present invention can be, for example, a plasmid, a bacmid, a phagemid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus or an artificial chromosome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that CD8 and Fas-L can also be expressed from a single vector construct as a single chimeric transcript, provided this transcript includes an IRES sequence for directing the translation of a second polypeptide encoded by the transcript. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Thus according to this aspect of the present invention the method of transplanting a donor transplant utilizes a veto cell preparation of genetically modified non-T-cells expressing recombinant Fas ligand and recombinant CD8 antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that such a veto cell preparation is inherently advantageous for inducing tolerance of transplants since such a preparation does not include cells of T-lymphatic origin and therefore, such veto cells inherently cannot induce GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In addition, since such cells are derived from the donor they serve as excellent traps for CTL progenitors generated by the recipient as a response to the transplant and as such prevent or ameliorate transplant/graft rejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Thus, this aspect of the present invention describes an alternative approaches to generating non-alloreactive anti-third party veto cells. By expressing Fas-L and CD8, in a variety of cells, these cells can serve as veto cells for antigens against which tolerance induction is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the anti-third party CTLs described by other aspects of the present invention, these &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; veto cells could help reduce the effective CD34 megadose requirements in mismatched leukemia patients and may lead to safe mismatched hematopoietic transplants in patients for whom the risk of supralethal radio-chemotherapy is not justified, such as patients with thalassemia, sickle cell anemia and several enzyme deficiencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, induction of substantial durable chimerism can be used, according to the present invention, to induce tolerance towards organ or tissue transplants, or as a prelude for adaptive cell therapy in cancer patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting.

<heading lvl="1">Generation of Donor Anti-Third Party Mouse CTLs: IL-2 Starvation Improves Deletion of Anti-Host CTL Precursors </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Non-myeloablative conditioning protocols are currently explored in elderly leukemia patients who have HLA identical donors. Engraftment is mediated in these patients by the large number of T-cells present in the unseparated peripheral blood progenitor preparations used for transplantation. Thus, these transplants are associated with limited GVHD and with anti-host reactivity leading to myeloablation of host hematopoiesis. However, for patients who do not have a fully matched donor, T-cell toxicity is more pronounced and rather unacceptable. Removal of alloreactive T-cells from the transplant inoculum is likely to weaken the engraftment potency and to result in a high rate of graft rejection. As such, and as described in this Example, anti-third party CTL preparations devoid of cells capable of maturing into anti-host CTLs were established in order to reduce the rate of rejection and to prevent induction of GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> While reducing the present invention to practice and as is specifically shown herein, the inventors have uncovered that CTL veto cell preparations of a donor type, can be effectively depleted of alloreactivity against host cells by stimulation against third party stimulators by initial exogenous IL-2 starvation. This depletion is due to the fact that only activated CTL precursors (CT&apos;s) are capable of surviving the IL-2 starvation in the primary culture. Evidently, this CTL preparation depleted of alloreactivity against the host could potentially facilitate the induction of donor type chimerism without GVHD in sub-lethally irradiated recipients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In addition, this study, examines the mechanisms responsible for the veto activity mediated by non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Materials and Methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Animals: 6-12 week old female mice were used. C3/HeJ, BALB/c, C57BL/6, gld/C3H/HeJ, lpr/C3H/HeJ were obtained from the Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). A breeding pair of Transgenic H-2<highlight><superscript>b </superscript></highlight>mice expressing the TCR-ab from the CTL clone 2C with specificity for L<highlight><superscript>d</superscript></highlight>, was kindly provided by Janko Nikolic-Zugic, (Sloan-Kettering, NY). Progeny from these Tg mice and PO mice were bred at the Weizmann Institute Animal Breeding Center (Rehovot, Israel). All mice were kept in small cages (five animals in each cage) and fed sterile food and acid water containing cyprofloxacin (20 &mgr;g/ml). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Preparation of non-alloreactive donor anti-third party CTLs: Splenocytes of Balb/c mice (donor responders) were harvested and single cell suspensions were prepared. The cell suspensions were treated with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride to remove red cells and the isolated mononuclear cells (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml) were stimulated with irradiated (20 Gy) C57BL/6 or C3H/HeJ (third party stimulators) splenocytes (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml), and treated with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride. Responders and stimulators were incubated in a complete tissue culture medium (CTCM) at 37&deg; C. in a 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/air Heraeus incubator. 5 days following seeding, 20 U/ml of human rhIL-2 (Eurocetus, Milan, Italy) were added to the mixed lymphocyte reaction culture every 24 hours, 2 days later the medium was replaced by a fresh culture medium. 10 days following seeding, the MLR cultures were harvested, fractionated on Ficol-Paque plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Sweden), analyzed by FACS for their CD8 level and added to the MLR cultures at different cell ratios, as described hereinbelow in the results section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> MLR cultures and cytotoxicity assay: Spleen cells of C3H/Hej mice (responders) were harvested and single cell suspensions were prepared as described above. The cells (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml) were then stimulated with irradiated (20 Gy) Balb/c splenocytes (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml), or with 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml irradiated (20 Gy) SJL splenocytes. Four-six replicates per group were cultured in 96-well U bottomed plates in 0.2 ml CTCM, for 6 days at 37&deg; C. (5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere). ConA blasts generated from SJL or Balb/c spleen cells (2 days in the presence of 2 mg ConA/2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml) were labeled with <highlight><superscript>51</superscript></highlight>Cr (NEN, Boston Mass.). Cell-mediated lysis assay was performed using variable numbers of MLR effector cells and 5000 target cells in 96-well V-bottom plates. <highlight><superscript>51</superscript></highlight>Cr release was measured after a 4-h incubation at 37&deg; C. Results are expressed as a specific lysis calculated as follows: % specific lysis&equals;100&times;((experimental release&minus;spontaneous release)/(maximum release&minus;spontaneous release)). The standard deviation (SD) of replicate values were consistently less than 10% of the mean. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Veto activity of non-alloreactive donor anti-third party CTLs: To determine whether mouse non-alloreactive donor anti-third party CTLs possess veto activity, spleen cells from C3H/HeJ mice (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml) were incubated for 6 days with irradiated (20 Gy) allogeneic spleen cells (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml) from Balb/c (H-2 matched) or SJL (H-2 mismatch) mice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Non-alloreactive donor anti-third party Balb/c CTLs were added to the MLC at a 1:100, 1:50 and 1:10 veto: responder cell ratio. The killing activity of the responder CTL-p was determined by <highlight><superscript>51</superscript></highlight>Cr-release assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Inhibition of the veto effect of CTLs by anti-CD8 mAb: Veto anti-third party CTLs from Balb/c origin were added to the MLR described above, at a final concentration of 2%. Anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Uli Hamerling, Sloan-Kettering, NY) directed against Ly-2.2 antigen expressed selectively on the veto cells and not on the effector cells, was added to the MLR at different concentrations as described in results, and the inhibition of the veto effect was monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Deletion of anti-H2<highlight><superscript>d </superscript></highlight>T-cells by non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs: Spleen cells of 2C Transgenic H-2<highlight><superscript>b </superscript></highlight>mice expressing the TCR-ab with specificity for L<highlight><superscript>d </superscript></highlight>mice (kindly provided by Janko Nikolie-Zugic, Sloan-Kettering, NY), were treated as described above. The cells (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml) were then stimulated with irradiated (20 Gy) Balb/c splenocytes (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml) in the presence of 2% or 20% veto anti-third party CTLs originated from Balb/c or from SJL (background control) splenocytes. Cultures containing 20% or 2% veto CTLs were continued for 48 hours or 5 days, respectively, in 6-well plates. The deletion of transgenic T-cells was monitored by cytoflourometry, measuring the level of 2C transgenic cells specifically stained by the 1B2 antibody directed against the clonotypic anti-H-2L<highlight><superscript>d </superscript></highlight>TCR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Cytoflowmetry: FACS analysis was performed using a modified Becton Dickinson FACScan. Fluorescence data were collected using 3-decade logarithmic amplification on 25-50&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>viable cells as determined by forward-light-scatter intensity. Cells were stained with a CD8a (Ly-2)FITC, CD3e-PE, CD95 (Fas)-FITC (Phamingen) CD4-Qantum Red (sigma), 1B2 biotinated (kindly provided by Janko Nikolic-Zugic, Sloan-Kettering, NY), R-PE streptavidin (Jackson Immuno Research Lab. Inc.) Vectors for gene transfer: PLNGFP-mock vector was constructed by subcloning gene encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP, Clontech) from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) into EcoRI and HpaI sites of pLXSN provided by A D Miller, St. Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenn.) PLNGFPFas-L was also a derivative of pLXSN and was constructed by subcloning of a fragment containing EGFP gene, internal nbosome entry site (IRES) and murine Fas-L cDNA into BamHI and XhoI sites of pLXSN (LTR-EGFP-IRS-mFas-L-SV40p-NeoR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Packaging of refroviral vectors and virus supernatant production: Plasmid DNA was transfected into ecotropic murine retroviral vector packaging cell line GP-E86 and stably transfected cells were selected with G418. High titter packaging cell lines were isolated by screening individual colonies. Retrovirus supernatant was prepared according to standard procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Gene transfer into splenocytes of Fas-L mutated C3H-gld mice: 50 u/ml of human rhIL-2 were added to a CTL culture generated from &ldquo;gld&rdquo; spleen cells. Two days following addition, the stimulated CTLs were resuspended in RPMI-1640 containing 5 mg/ml protamine sulfate and 50 u/ml rhIL-2 and were incubated with viral supernatant which was added daily for 3 days. Forty eight hours following the last addition of the viral supernatant, the infected cells were selected in G418 (450 mg/ml) in the presence of rbIL-2 (50 u/ml) for one week and then tested for their veto activity in MLR as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Experimental Results: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Veto activity of anti-third party CTLs: To evaluate the effect of IL2 starvation on anti-host reactivity of non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs, Balb/c (H-2<highlight><superscript>d</superscript></highlight>) splenocytes were stimulated, in the presence or absence of recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2), against irradiated (20 Gy) C57BL/6 (H-2<highlight><superscript>b</superscript></highlight>, third party) splenocytes in MLR culture for 4 days. On the second day or fifth day of the cell culture rhIL-2 was added and the cells were kept for additional six days. After culture, these cells were harvested and tested for their CTL-p frequency against the intended host (C3H) or the third party used for stimulation (C57BL/6). As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, following IL2 starvation for 4 days no anti-host CTLp could be detected while a significant frequency of anti-host CTLp was documented when IL2 was added to the MLR culture on the second day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> To evaluate the veto activity of such non-alloreactive C, Balb/c H-2<highlight><superscript>d </superscript></highlight>splenocytes were stimulated against irradiated (20 Gy) C57BL/6 H-2<highlight><superscript>b </superscript></highlight>(third party) splenocytes in MLR culture for 10 days, adding rbIL-2 only on the fifth day of the cell culture. Following culturing, these cells were harvested and tested for their veto activity in MLR cultures of C3H/Hej H-2<highlight><superscript>k </superscript></highlight>responder cells (host type) stimulated against irradiated splenocytes from Balb/c (donor type), or in an SJL culture (non-relevant control, H-2<highlight><superscript>s </superscript></highlight>type). The inhibition of killing activity exerted by the veto cells on the responder cells was determined 6 days post culturing by the <highlight><superscript>51</superscript></highlight>Cr release assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(17 different experiments) and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (one representative experiment), an addition of cells generated in a Balb/c CTL line directed against third party cells and cultured in the absence of IL-2, inhibits the killing activity of the responder cells (C3H/Hej) which were stimulated against Balb/c splenocytes. In contrast, the addition of cells from the same CTL line to responder cells (C3H/Hej) that were stimulated against SJL splenocytes, did not affect the responders killing activity. The specificity revealed by these results suggests that the non-alloreactive CTLs directed against third party, indeed possess veto activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The dose response curve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>suggests that the anti-third party CTLs possess a very marked veto activity, attaining complete inhibition at a 1:50 veto/responder cell ratio. Addition of veto cells at 5 fold higher concentrations leads to non-specific elimination of CTL-p&apos;s directed at targets not sharing the donor type H-2 determinants (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Optimal specific inhibition is achieved upon addition of anti-third party CTLs, (at a 1:50 veto/responder cell ratio), between day 0 and day 2. Thereafter, the veto effect is markedly reduced (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Thus, as previously suggested, veto cells probably inhibit or delete the responder cells at the precursor level<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Once these CTL precursors develop into differentiated CTLs the veto cells can no longer exert their effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In addition, by using monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD8a Ly-2.2 allele expressed on the anti-third party CTLs but not on the responder cells, confirmed previous observations<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>that the CD8 molecules of the veto cells participate in the deletion of the responder cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The role of Fas-Fas-L apoptosis: The role of apoptosis in responder cell deletion was confirmed by two approaches: (i) the addition of the apoptosis inhibitor (BD-FmK) to the MLR culture led to a complete inhibition of the veto effect (data not shown); and (ii) the addition of anti-third party CTLs of Balb/c (H-2<highlight><superscript>d</superscript></highlight>) origin, to an MLR culture of TCR transgenic C57B1/6 responders bearing the 2C TCR directed against H-2<highlight><superscript>d</superscript></highlight>, led to a marked and specific deletion of the transgenic responders upon stimulation against Balb/c stimulators (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Considering that two distinct major apoptosis mechanisms, namely perforin mediated or Fas-Fas-L mediated apoptosis have been previously described, two different non-alloreactive anti-third party CTL lines from splenocytes of Fas-L deficient strain (C3H-gld, H-2<highlight><superscript>k</superscript></highlight>) or from splenocytes of perforin deficient mice (PO, H-2<highlight><superscript>bd</superscript></highlight>) were prepared. C3H-gld or PO-splenocytes were stimulated against irradiated C57BL/6 H-2<highlight><superscript>b </superscript></highlight>or DBA/1H-2<highlight><superscript>q </superscript></highlight>splenocytes, respectively, as described for wild type splenocytes (culturing for 10 days, without the addition of exogenous rhIL-2 during the first 4 days). The use of veto cells of gld -C3H/Hej (H-2<highlight><superscript>k </superscript></highlight>origin) and of PO (H-2<highlight><superscript>bd </superscript></highlight>origin) necessitated changes in the design of the MLR responders and stimulators utilized. Thus, the gld mutant anti-third party CTLs were added to bulk MLR cultures in which Balb/c responders were stimulated against C3H/Hej splenocytes. The PO knockout anti-third party CTLs were added to bulk MLR cultures in which C3H/Hej responders were stimulated against PO or SJL splenocytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the anti-third party CTLs originating from C3H-gld lacked veto activity, whereas the CTLs originating from perforin deficient mice did exhibit significant veto activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Additional evidence to the role of Fas-L in the veto effect was afforded by gene transfer experiments in which gld-anti-third party CTLs were transfected with Fas-L, using a retroviral vector. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>such transfected CTLs exhibited marked veto activity compared to mock-infected anti-third party CTLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Using a similar approach, the role of Fas in the veto activity induced by anti-third party CTLs was investigated. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, when Fas deficient C3H-lpr splenocytes were stimulated against Balb/c in the primary MLR culture, the addition of Balb/c anti-third party CTLs failed to inhibit the primary CTLs. In contrast, these cells exhibited veto activity when added to primary MLR cultures of wild type C3H responders. Similarly, a Fas antagonist (Fas fusion protein) also inhibited the veto effect of anti-third party CTLs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> FACS analysis of Fas during a typical MLR of 2C splenocytes against Balb/c stimulators (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), revealed that Fas expression on CD8<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> 1B2<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> T-cells is markedly enhanced at 48 hr (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Addition of Balb anti-C3H (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), but not SJL anti-C3H CTLs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), led to a marked deletion of the Fas<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> activated CD8 T cells, illustrating the potent veto activity and the remarkable specificity by which the anti-third party veto CTLs expressing Fas-L <highlight><superscript>25</superscript></highlight>, <highlight><superscript>29 </superscript></highlight>are capable of selectively recognizing and killing Fas<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> T-cells aimed against their H-2 antigens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Altogether these results suggest that the veto effect of non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs is mediated by the simultaneous expression of CD8 and Fas-L on the veto CTLs and the expression of Fas on the effector CTL-p&apos;s directed against the antigens presented by the veto cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Following 10 days of co-culture, the cells were harvested and live cells were isolated on Ficoll-Paque gradients and re-stimulated, 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml with 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml of stimulators. Four days later the cultures were treated with hrIL-2 at 20 U/ml, for the first time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the cultures were treated three times per week, each time with 20 U/ml rhIL-2. The third treatment also included the addition of irradiated stimulators at a ratio of 4:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The CTL line, originally stimulated against stimulator S was tested for CTL-p responders against the original stimulator S or against stimulator No. 38 which represents the intended host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The cells from this anti-third party CTL line were cultured either with stimulator S or with stimulator 38, at 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cell/ml 1:1 for 5 days. The cells were then harvested from the bulk culture and serial dilutions of CTL responder cells (4&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>to 0.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) per well, were prepared with the original irradiated stimulators. Each well contains 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>of irradiated (30 Gy) stimulator 38 or 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>(100 Gy) irradiated stimulator S.

<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Non-alloreactive human CTL lines were established in-vitro by stimulating PBLs with EBV transformed cell line of known HLA type. While a significant level of anti-host CTLp was demonstrated in untreated PBL of donor A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), it was found that the anti-third party CTL line that was generated from PBL of the same donor A was markedly depleted of such cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). These results indicate that the CTL preparation of this Example is depleted of T-cells having the potential of maturing into anti-host CTLs (alloreactive CTLs) and is therefore advantageous as an agents for enhancing graft acceptance in humans. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Prior art approaches, which make use of T-cell stimulation with the very antigens against which tolerance is desired, might involve some risk for generating committed CTLs, if any of the CTL-p escape deletion or anergy induction. Once such anti-host CTLs are generated, it is very difficult to suppress their alloreactivity in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> A more recent approach, demonstrated that a &ldquo;megadose&rdquo; of cells can be applied to induce tolerance in sublethally irradiated mice, and as such effectively overcome the marked resistance presented by the large number of lymphocytes surviving the sublethal conditioning. However, the number of cells required to attain this desirable goal may not be easily collected from human donors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Non-alloreactive anti-third party CTLs which can be used to enhance graft acceptance in mice were also shown, however, it was soon realized that such CTL preparations are not depleted of T-cells capable of developing post transplantation into anti-host CTLs inflicting GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The present research demonstrates that donor anti-third party CTLs can be depleted of anti-host alloreactivity if exogenous IL-2 is not provided during the initial days of the bulk culture with the stimulator cells. Such non-alloreactive CTLs can enhance engraftment, without GVHD, of, for example, T-cell depleted BM originating from the same donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The present study further uncovers the mechanism responsible for the marked potent veto activity of such anti-third party CTLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> By utilizing anti-CD8 antibodies, the present study demonstrates that the expression of CD8 on the CTLs is crucial for CTL-p recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> By using anti-third party non-alloreactive CTLs generated from spleen cells of different mutant mice the present study demonstrates that the veto activity of these cells is mediated by apoptosis via the Fas-Fas-L system and not by the perforin mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Thus, the results of the present study suggest that simultaneous expression of both CD8 and Fas-L on the CTL surface and the expression of Fas on the effector CTL-p is a prerequisite for the veto activity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The Primate Model </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Materials and Methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Monkeys: Female cynomolgus monkeys (aged 1.5-2 years) weighing 1.5-2.5 kg, are used as bone marrow recipients and MLC mismatched male cynomolgus monkeys weighing 6-9 kg are used as donors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Conditioning regimen: A sublethal irradiation-based protocol utilized is as follows: Fludarabine (FLU) 40 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>from day-9 (prior to transplantation) to day-5 (total amount 200 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>); Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 5 mg/kg from day-7 to -3 and 6.5 or 7 Gy TBI (dose rate 0.15 Gy/min) delivered on day-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collection: RhG-CSF (20 mg/kg/day) is administered to donor monkeys over a period of five days in two daily subcutaneous injections. Two leukapheresis procedures are performed between days 4 and 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Donors and leukapheresis: Healthy male cynomologus donors are subjected to a double or triple set of 100-minute leukapheresis on a Cobe Spectra cell separator, as described by Hillyer et al. &lsqb;reference No. 27&rsqb; with the following minor modifications: acid, citrate, dextrose (ACD)-to-blood ratio is 12:14 and centrifuge speed is 1,600 rpm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Peripheral blood mononuclear cell processing: Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) preparations are depleted of T-lymphocytes using the E-rosetting technique, as previously described<highlight><superscript>26</superscript></highlight>. Stem cells are then purified by positive selection by using an avidin-biotin immunoadsorbtion column (CEPRATE SC System, CellPro, Bothell, Wash.), according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. The number of CD34<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> cells is measured both in whole blood and in the leukapheresis product by flow cytometry. The T-lymphocytes before and after T-cell-depletion are also measured, by using a phycoerythrin-coupled anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody. Aliquots are taken for differential cell counts, mAb staining and GFU-GM assay at each stage of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Supportive care: Monkeys are cared for in laminar air-flow cages until the neutrophils count recovered to 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>/L. All monkeys receive cyproxin and amphotericin B as gut preparation, combined antibiotics as prophylaxis against bacterial infection since the day of transplant, and fluconazole as antifingal prophylaxis. Acyclovir is administered for preventing viral infection. Whole blood or component blood products are transfused according to monkey&apos;s hematocrit and platelet count. All blood products are irradiated with 25-30 Gy and filtered before transfusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Engraftment and chimerism deteriniation: Time to engraftment is assessed by determining the day after transplant on which monkeys displayed a level of 0.5 neutrophils&times;10<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>/L and 25&times;10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>platelets/L independent of transfusion support. Chimerism is assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Briefly, the PCR products are subjected to 3% MetaPhor agarose (FMC) gel. The density of each band for Y specific DNA and competitor DNA is measured by using computerized densitometer and the target (Y specific)/competitor DNA (T/C) ratio for each sample is calculated. At the point where Y specific and competitor DNA are in equivalence (i.e., ratio&equals;1.0), the starting amount of Y specific DNA prior to PCR is equal to the known starting amount of competitor DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Generation of donor-anti-third party CTLs: A slightly modified procedure is used for preparation of monkey donor anti-third party CTLs. Peripheral blood cells of donor and third party monkeys are fractionated on Ficoll-Paque plus and the isolated mononuclear cells, 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml of responder cells and 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/ml irradiated (20 Gy) third party stimulators, are cultured for 10 days in CTCM medium. Four days hours after seeding, human rhIL-2 (20 U/ml, Eurocetus, Milan, Italy), is added every 24 hours. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> It was observed that the level of CD8&plus; cells in the CTL cultures prepared essentially as described above is extremely variable. Therefore, selection of CD8&plus; cells by removal (negative selection) of CD4&plus; and CD56&plus; cells, using antibodies linked to magnetic beads. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the cells obtained by this procedure exhibited very potent veto activity at a ratio of 1:25 and 1:50 veto to effector cell ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Treatment of donor cells: Anti third party CTLs were prepared by stimulating donor peripheral blood lymphocytes against EBV transformed human derived cell line of a known HLA type (stimulators) in 24&mdash;well plates.

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> After 10 days of co-culture, the cells were harvested and live cells were isolated on ficoll gradient and re-stimulated, the cells were resuspended to a concentration of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml and were re-stimulated with 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>stimulator cells/ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Four days later, the cells were negatively selected for CD4&plus; and CD56&plus; cells with MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec). The unbound cells were resuspended at 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml and re-stimulated with 0.33&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>stimulator cells/ml. At this stage (following two weeks in culture) the cells were treated with interieukin-2 (IL-2, Proleukin) at 600 Units/ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the cultures were treated three times per week, each time with 600U/ml IL-2. The third time also included the addition of irradiated stimulators at a ratio of 4:1. Please note that during the first two weeks of culture, no IL-2 was added to the cells. </paragraph>
