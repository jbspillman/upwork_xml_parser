<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a stream nozzle (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) for an inert gas welding torch (B). The inventive nozzle is provided with a coating (S) that adheres to at least a part of the surface of said nozzle in a material fit and consists of silver, especially galvanically mounted contact silver. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a welding torch as generically defined by the preamble to claim 1 and to a stream nozzle as generically defined by the preamble to claim 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The stream nozzle, also known as a contact nozzle, typically comprises electrolyte copper, or a more-wear-resistant copper-chromium-zirconium alloy. Other variant alloys also exist, for instance with beryllium. The task of the stream nozzle is to transmit current to the electrode wire and to guide it. For good process safety, an optimal current transfer from the nozzle stock to the stream nozzle is necessary. Moreover, the stream nozzle must transmit considerable heat over the mounting region. In practice, until now, stream nozzles have predominantly been used without surface treatment, that is, bare or bare to the copper; they are secured replaceably to the nozzle stock via a screw connection or a plug-type connection. In welding, welding beads or welding splashes that occur exhibit the undesired tendency to adhere to the exposed surface of the stream nozzle. This can cause adverse effects on the flow conditions for the inert gas that glows on the outside along the stream nozzle to the welding point. Welding splashes adhering to the end face and in the vicinity of the exit from the electrode wire duct can hinder advancement from friction with the electrode wire. In practice, stream nozzles are therefore known that at least on their jacket face and end face have a metal coating, in the form of chromium- or nickel-plating. This coating is intended to provide improved reflection of the arc radiation (reduced heat consumption) and also to prevent the welding splashes from adhering (anti-adhesive effect). Not only are coatings formed by chromium- or nickel-plating expensive; they do not meet the expectations made of them to a satisfactory extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, whenever the coating extends into the mounting region of the stream nozzle, current transfer problems occur; this is suspected to be because the current transfer fluctuates as a function of the layer thickness. In applying the coating, it is therefore necessary that the application region intended for the current transfer be covered as well. This is expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to disclose a welding torch of the type defined at the outset, and a stream nozzle for this kind of inert gas welding torch, that makes it economically possible to achieve an optimal anti-adhesive and reflective action. A part of the object is also that the metal coating have no adverse influence on the current transfer but instead even improve the current transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The stated object is attained by the characteristics of claim 1 and claim 8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, a silver coating leads to excellent anti-adhesion and reflective effects. Even if the silver coating is meant to extend into the mounting region, it has no adverse effect on the current transfer but in fact even improves the current transfer. The heat transfer capability of a silver coating is already optimal. Applying the silver coating can be done economically, particularly in mass production. Since the silver coating has no adverse effect on the current transfer and in fact even improves it, when the coating is applied there is no need to cover regions of the surface that are important for the current transfer. This makes coating the stream nozzle simpler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Expediently, the coating comprises galvanically or chemically applied contact silver. Contact silver can be applied with the desired layer thickness and good adhesion to the material comprising the contact nozzle at low equipment expense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The coating should have an essentially uniform layer thickness, preferably between about 6 and 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The silver coating should be uniform, at least on the jacket face and the free end face of the stream nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, it is especially expedient for the entire surfaces of the stream nozzles to be provided with the silver coating. This simplifies the procedure in galvanic or chemical coating of the stream nozzle considerably. The silver coating, which is also present in the region of attachment to or contact with the nozzle stock or inner tube of the torch as well, leads to optimal current transfer and heat transfer and makes an important contribution to process safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a stream nozzle with a screw attachment for producing a screw connection to the nozzle stock or the inner tube of the torch, the male thread of the screw attachment is also covered with the silver coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A stream nozzle with a plug-in attachment for producing a plug-type connection to the nozzle stock or inner tube of the torch is also covered with the silver coating on the fitting faces,of the plug-in attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other metal spraying methods are naturally also practicable for applying the silver coating.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> longitudinal section through part of a torch head, with another embodiment of a stream nozzle.</paragraph>
</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a torch head K of an inert gas welding torch B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an inner tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the torch, on its free end, has a male thread onto which a nozzle stock D is mounted detachably, in the embodiment shown. On an outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the torch, there is a seat <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for a gas nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Between the inner tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, insulators <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided, usually of nonmetal material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The nozzle stock D, as a sleeve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is equipped with nozzle bores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a front female-thread portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for screwing a stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> into it. The stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which for instance comprises electrolyte copper or a copper-chromium-zirconium alloy, is screwed with a screw attachment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into the female thread <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is thus secured replaceably. Extending through the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is an electrode wire delivery conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which discharges at a free end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; the end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is optionally slightly recessed relative to the end of the orifice <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Between where the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mounted on the nozzle stock D and the end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there is an outer jacket region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A coating S of silver is applied over the full surface and adhering by material engagement, at least to the jacket region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Expediently, this is a galvanically applied contact silver. However, the coating S can also extend as far as the screw attachment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and even on into the duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in a further embodiment of the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a plug-type connection is provided. The stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a plug-in attachment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; with fitting faces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that fit corresponding fitting faces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; of the nozzle stock D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In both embodiments, the mounting of the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the nozzle stock D is shown. It is also conceivable for the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be mounted directly on the inner tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, correspondingly modified, of the torch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the coating S is embodied of silver, preferably galvanically applied contact silver, in such a way that it covers the entire surface of the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; that is, it covers the end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, jacket face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and fitting faces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The layer thickness X of the coating S is expediently between 2 and 15 &mgr;m, and preferably between about 6 and 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For applying the silver coating, a plurality of stream nozzles <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the bare state, optionally after conventional precleaning processes,.are placed in a galvanic bath, until the silver coating S has been applied to the desired layer thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the anti-adhesive effect of the silver coating S at least temporarily, the possibility exists of spraying on a parting agent, typically an oily substance, which contains additives with which the surface of the silver coating S is passivated, which enhances the anti-adhesion effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The silver coating, extending as far as the inside of the mounting region of the stream nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the nozzle stock D or the inner tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the torch and existing over the full surface in this region as well, improves the current transfer in an optimal way. </paragraph>
