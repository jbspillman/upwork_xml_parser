<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an undercarriage for a vehicle, which undercarriage is of the type with a swan-neck, and comprises at least two longitudinal beams, the height of the foremost part of the longitudinal beams being reduced in height, said swan-neck being thus formed by a change in height of the longitudinal beams; at least one transverse beam and at least one wheel axle, whereby at least the longitudinal beams are made of a composite material consisting of synthetic material with reinforcing fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> By vehicle, here a towed vehicle as well as an automotive vehicle is intended, with at least one axle at both extremities as well as with at least one axle only at the rear extremity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In particular, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a semitrailer, with one or more axles at the rear extremity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such undercarriage for a vehicle is described in the international patent application no. 97/48589. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal beams, and preferably also the transverse beams and the trestles with which the wheel axles possibly are connected to the longitudinal beams, are made of a thermosetting resin, to wit polyester, reinforced with glass fibres, carbon fibres, aramide fibres and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such composite materials, however, show a sensitivity to ageina, and after a certain period of time, the beams and other parts consisting of such composite materials will show microscopic cracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, such composite materials are difficult to recycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The fixation of the transverse beams and the trestles at the longitudinal beams is performed by means of glue, as a result of which the connections are difficult to inspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The deformation of a longitudinal beam, which in most cases is made by pultrusion and which consists of a composite material with a thermosetting synthetic material, is difficult, as a result of which it is not possible to manufacture a semitrailer with a so-called swan-neck part in an economic manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention has as an aim to remedy these disadvantages and to provide an undercarriage having good mechanical properties which also will be maintained after a certain period of time, which undercarriage may comprise other connections than glue connections and which can be brought into the desired form more easily </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this aim is achieved in that the synthetic material of the composite material, of which at least the longitudinal beams are made, is a thermoplastic synthetic material, and in chat the height of the foremost part of the longitudinal beams is reduced by means of plastic deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As the composite material comprises thermoplastic synthetic material, it may in fact easily be made deformable by being heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the longitudinal beams have two lateral flanks and, at the foremost part of these beams, the upright lateral flanks bend out or bulge, preferably outwardly, due to a thermoplastic deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> At the foremost part of the beams, the upright lateral flanks preferably bend out so that two adjacent longitudinal portions of each flank are in contact with each other. These portions may be glued or welded together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Suitable synthetic materials are polypropylene and polyamide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, also the transverse beam is made of composite material with thermoplastic synthetic material and, in the case that the wheel axle is connected to a longitudinal beam by the intermediary of a trestle, according to a particular form of embodiment also this trestle consists of composite material with thermoplastic synthetic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The transverse beam and, possibly, the trestles may be glued to the longitudinal beam, however, preferably are welded thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a method which is particularly suitable for manufacturing longitudinal beams for the aforementioned undercarriage with swan-neck part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, the invention relates to a method for manufacturing a longitudinal beam for an undercarriage for a vehicle with swan-neck part, which longitudinal beam comprises a hollow core with lateral flanks, according to which method the longitudinal beam is made of a synthetic material and reinforcing fibres, with a constant cross-section over its length, and which is characterised in that the longitudinal beam is made of a thermoplastic synthetic material with reinforcing fibres, first with a constant cross-section, and that it subsequently is locally heated until it can be deformed and that it finally, under the influence of pressure, is deformed such that the lateral flanks thereof bend out or bulge such that the height thereof is reduced.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> combination is represented of a truck tractor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a vehicle according to the invention, which forms a semitrailer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, whereby the semitrailer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is of the type with a so-called swan-neck and consists in a usual manner of a chassis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which at the rear rests on two wheel sets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and upon which a floor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and/or a non-represented superstructure are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The chassis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> substantially is formed of two hollow longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and transverse beams <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> mounted in between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as well as the transverse beams <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are made of composite material which consists of thermoplastic synthetic material reinforced with fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Suitable thermoplastic synthetic materials are, amongst others, polypropylene and polyamide, whereas suitable reinforcing fibres are, amongst others, glass fibres, carbon fibres, kevlar fibres or aramide fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> have an I-profile with a hollow core and consist of an upper flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a lower flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and two lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> situated in between. They may be composed of several base profiles fixed to each other, as well as consist of one single piece, such as in the represented example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> These longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are manufactured, for example, by means of techniques such as &ldquo;continuous compressing moulding&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As represented in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the wheel sets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> substantially consist of a wheel axle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is borne in bearings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which are connected to the chassis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a springy manner, and of wheels <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> attached to the extremities of the wheel axle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The springy mounting of each bearing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in respect to a longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is performed, as represented in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, by the intermediary of a fixation part, a so-called trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is situated with its upper portion between the two lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, at the location of an interruption <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the lower flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and, possibly, also of an interruption <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the upper flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of this longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Said trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has the shape of a tubular element which reaches up to the upper edge of the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and which, below this longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is chamfered at the rear side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be manufactured of steel or aluminium, however, preferably it is also made of composite material with a thermoplastic synthetic material, for example, by the so-called &ldquo;hand lay-up&rdquo; method or by forming under heat and pressure, the so-called &ldquo;compressing moulding&rdquo;. This last-mentioned technique consists in bringing the synthetic material and the reinforcing fibres or a mat of pre-impregnated fibres into a heated mould and subsequently pressing the mixture of polymer and reinforcing material into the desired form, by means of a high pressure of, for example, approximately 100 ton per m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The extremity of the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> situated between the lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fixed to these lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with two flat lateral walls, for example, glued thereto, but preferably welded. Possibly, the fixation still can be reinforced by bolts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Below the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may widen somewhat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At the lowest extremity of the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a leaf spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fixed, possibly in a hingeable manner. At a distance from the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the bearing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixed upon the leaf spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by means of fixation means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Between the bearing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a location of the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> situated below the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a shock absorber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is provided, whereas between the free extremity of the leaf spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, an air bellows <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is situated which is connected to a source of compressed air in a manner which is not represented in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The transverse beams <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> each consist of a round tubular body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and round flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at both extremities. The body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is also made of the aforementioned composite material, possibly by pulwinding or filament winding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Pulwinding is a variant of pultrusion, whereby one or more layers of reinforcing fibres are wound on a mandrel, which layers, before and/or after being provided, are impregnated with the synthetic material, after which the whole is pulled through an extrusion element, after which the synthetic material hardens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Filament winding is a method whereby reinforcing fibres or ribbons, impregnated with synthetic material, are wound onto a rotating mandrel or cylinder, after which the synthetic material hardens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are manufactured separately from the same composite material, preferably by means of the aforementioned &ldquo;compression moulding&rdquo;, and are welded or glued to the extremities of the body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, preferably with a two-component glue, such as epoxy glue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Instead of separately formed flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be provided with an enlargement at both extremities, whereby the transverse beam <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> then can be manufactured in one piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The transverse beams <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are fixed with their flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or the enlargement to a lateral flank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, for example, glued with a flexible glue, such as a two-component glue, however, preferably, they are welded. Possibly, the connection still may be reinforced by bolts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A transverse beam <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may also be provided in the abovedescribed manner between the parts of two opposite trestles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which protrude at the underside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The obtained tubular construction of the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provides for more light-weight beams with a particular resistance against torsion. The transverse beams <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> do not only keep the two longitudinal beams in place, but also take up the torsion forces of the chassis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The fact that the upper portion of the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> protrudes between the lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, allows for that this trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is welded or glued to two vertical lateral walls, which results in a very large contact surface and avoids a lumped load on the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If necessary, in the vicinity of the wheel axles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be reinforced at their lower sides by auxiliary longitudinal beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As the semitrailer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is of the type with a so-called swan-neck, the underside of the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, at the foremost part or front portion, is placed offset in upward direction in order to be situated above the rear part of the truck tractor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This is obtained by reducing height of the beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at this foremost part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the semitrailer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described heretofore may comprise a coupling plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in front, consisting of the same composite material as the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which plate is fixed to the underside of this latter, for example, welded thereto, and below carries the kingpin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with which the semitrailer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be connected to the centre plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the truck tractor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are made of a composite material with thermoplastic synthetic material, they can be brought into the aforementioned shape in a simple manner in order to form the swan-neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, such longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a profile made in one piece is represented in detail, such as it is manufactured first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the foremost part thereof is heated until the composite material can be deformed, after which on the foremost part the underside of the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is deformed up into the aforementioned shape which is represented in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> This deformation is performed under pressure, whereby this pressure may be an external pressure which is exerted, for example, by an hydraulic press. This press pushes, for example, with a punch onto the lower flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereas the upper flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This external pressure may also be the atmospheric pressure in the case that a partial vacuum or vacuum is created in the hollow longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In both cases, the two lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the core of the longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which can be deformed by the heat, will bent out, preferably outward, as represented in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The deformation is such that side walls are laterally bent out until two adjacent longitudinal portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of a lateral flank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are moved to each other. Once against each other, these portions are welded or glued to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In order to weld these portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to each other, a heating wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, for example a carbon wire, is incorporated in one of or in each of these portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. For welding the portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, an electrical current is sent through the wires <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is obvious that the shape of the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is not limited to the shown shape and that these beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> must not necessarily be I-profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> show a longitudinal beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a different shape, especially with a different transversal section, which is rectangular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The decrease in height at the foremost part of the longitudinal beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to form the swan-neck is obtained in the same manner as described here before and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> With such beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the trestle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not tubular but comprises two parallel plates <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in thermoplastic material, the upper end of which is glued or welded to the lateral flanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The invention is in no way restricted to the forms of embodiment described heretofore and represented in the figures, on the contrary may such undercarriage be realised in different variants without leaving the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
