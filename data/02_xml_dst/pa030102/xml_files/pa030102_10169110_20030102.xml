<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is related to a communication control unit and a control method therefore, and particularly to a communication control unit for use with a wireless base station apparatus, and a control method therefor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As an apparatus having a communication control unit, there has been provided a wireless base station apparatus. The wireless base station apparatus performs communication between mobile terminals existing in a cell, which is in a communication availability range, to transmit receiving information to an exchange connected through a base station control unit, and sends transmitting information sent from the exchange to the corresponding mobile terminal. If a plurality of mobile terminals are existing in the cell, it performs communication between those mobile terminals by multiple access. Accordingly, in the wireless base station apparatus, there are provided a receiving amplifier, a transmitting amplifier, a wireless unit, and a baseband signal processing unit, as well as a control unit as a communication control unit for controlling the wireless base station apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the role of the control unit is important, and various countermeasures are taken for malfunctions. For instance, two systems of the same control unit are provided, wherein one system is intended for an active mode, whereas the other system is intended for a standby mode, and if a malfunction occurs in the control unit in the active mode, the control unit in the standby mode is switched to the active mode to take over the operation of the faulty control unit, whereby communication can be continued without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, the control unit for the active mode receives and stores various data measured at the information processing unit in a memory to implement smooth communication. For instance, if the condition of the radio wave from a mobile terminal in the peripheral region of a cell is bad and the receiving level is low, the transmitting power for the mobile terminal is increased, and the mobile terminal is instructed to increase its transmitting power. For the case of such power control, measured data on the number of CRC-NG (detection of the number of errors) is periodically received and stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, there was a problem that, when the control unit for the active mode malfunctioned and was switched to the control unit for the standby mode, the measured data sent from the information unit could not be received and a data loss occurred. In addition, since the control unit switched from the standby mode to the active mode cannot recognize the data loss, the measured data firstly received after the switching is stored next to the measured data lastly stored by the faulty unit, so that there was a problem that an error occurred if a power control and other controls were performed using the group of measured data stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This invention has been made to solve the above problem, and it aims to obtain a communication control unit which can recognize the loss of the measured data notified to a control unit and take a countermeasure against the data loss, and a control method therefor. </paragraph>

Further, the active-mode control unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the standby-mode control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are connected to a shared memory <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by a shared memory bus, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, each of the wireless unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the baseband signal processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and of the wire transmission line interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a plural construction, and can accommodate a plurality of mobile terminals. And, to perform a power control and other controls of the radio wave for a mobile terminal as a target to be controlled, a control target card (board) is mounted in the base station. Further, to provide for replacement in the event of failure or to increase the memory capacity, the active-mode control unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the standby-mode control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the shared memory <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> also have a card structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the card construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the active-mode control card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the standby-mode control card <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> respectively consist of a call processing card for controlling a call processing, and a maintenance management control card for managing a control target card, as described above. The call processing control card (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) performs the processing control related to a call. The information on a call includes communication speed which is resource information for the baseband signal processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, cell information which is resource information for the wireless unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and line information which is resource information for the wire transmission line interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The maintenance management control card (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) monitors the state of the control target card. The card state includes a current or normal operation state (active), a preliminary or normal standby state (standby), an alarm state, an error state, a block state, and a reset state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the normal operation state, the inputting, internal processing, and outputting of a signal are allowed. In the normal standby state, the inputting and internal processing of a signal are allowed, but the outputting of it is inhibited. The alarm state and the error state are states in which the normal operation cannot be performed. The block state is a state used for a card replacement operation. The reset state is a state similar to power activation, and has no effect on the bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the shared memory <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the timing of notifying measured data sent from the control target card to the active-mode control card. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the operation performed in the control method for the base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The operation is now described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The information unit comprising the wireless unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the baseband signal processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the wire transmission line interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> measures the status of the communication with a mobile terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and notifies the thus measured data to the active-mode control unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> at a fixed time interval. That is, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of control target cards notify measured data to the active-mode card through a control bus at a preset fixed time interval, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Measured data includes measured data regarding the channel state from the baseband signal processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, measured data regarding the cell discard rate from the wire transmission line interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, measured data of the total transmitting power from the wireless unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the like. For instance, in the measurement of the channel state, the receiving field level ratio (receiving Eb/IO) of the adjacent cell, the number of CRC-NG, which is the number of detected errors, and the like are measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As a result of the periodical measurement of the receiving field level ratio of the adjacent cell, if the field level ratio of the adjacent cell exceeds the field level ratio of the local cell, hand-over is initiated. Further, as a result of the periodical measurement of the number of CRC-NG, if it exceeds a prescribed upper value, it is determined that the radio wave condition is bad, and control is exercised to increase the standard for transmitting power. Conversely, if the measurement result does not exceed a prescribed lower limit value, it is determined that the radio wave is excessively good, and control is exercised to lower the standard for transmitting power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The measurement period or the measured data notification timing is preset for each measurement item, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the measurement period P in the particular measurement item is set in the corresponding item region in the measured data storing area within the shared memory <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the control target card corresponding to the measurement item in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> notifies the measured data on the item to the active-mode control card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for each measurement period P. Actually, there is an error in time, and if the maximum error time width is assumed to be &agr;, the measurement period is P&plusmn;&agr; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the control method for the active-mode control card <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> or the standby-mode control card <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (strictly speaking, the control card <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> after switching from the standby mode to the active mode). In the control program (or hardware) in these control cards, there is built a software module or a hardware module comprising a measured data receiving unit (step or data receiving means), a measured data storing unit (step or data storing means), measured data loss determination (step or data loss determination means), and measured data complementing (step or data complementing means). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the active-mode control card determines whether or not measured data is received (step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) by the activation of the measured data receiving unit, and if data is not received, it performs another processing (step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and waits for data reception. On the other hand, if data is received, it activates the measured data storing unit to store the data in the shared memory (step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Further, it stores the time of the data reception as a measuring time in the shared memory (step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> For instance, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, if measured data D<highlight><subscript>n&minus;3 </subscript></highlight>is received at the time T<highlight><subscript>n&minus;3</subscript></highlight>, the measured data D<highlight><subscript>n&minus;3 </subscript></highlight>is stored in the corresponding measured data storing region in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n&minus;3 </subscript></highlight>is stored in the measurement timing storing region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Then, if the active-mode control card operating in this flowchart malfunctions, and the standby-mode control card is switched to the active-mode control card and the operation of this flowchart is started, it is determined whether or not the received data is the first reception after the switching (step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). If it is not the first reception, there is no data loss, and the flow goes to step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to wait for the next data reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the received data is the first reception after the switching, it may be considered that the switching timing and the data receiving timing are overlapping. In such case, the control card cannot receive the notified measured data. Accordingly, the data loss determination unit is activated (step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to perform a calculation in which the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>for the previous measured data D<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>in the shared memory is subtracted from the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>for the first measured data (assumed to be D<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) after the switching, then the measurement period P is further subtracted from the resultant value of the above subtraction, and the absolute value of the resultant value is made &Dgr;T (step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). And, it is determined whether or not &Dgr; T is larger than the maximum error time width &agr; (step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If &Dgr;T is not larger than &agr;, the interval between the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>before the active/standby switching and the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>after the active/standby switching substantially matches the measurement period. Accordingly, the active/standby switching timing and the receiving timing for measured data do not overlap each other, so there is no data loss. In this case, the flow goes to step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to wait for the next data reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if &Dgr;T is larger than &agr;, the interval between the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>before the active-standby switching and the measuring time T<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>after the active/standby switching is considerably large. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the active/standby switching timing and the reception timing of measured data overlap each other, causing a data loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in this case, the data complementing unit is activated (step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). to create complement data (step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). For instance, complement data is created by averaging the measured data before the switching and the measured data after the switching. And, the thus created complement data is stored in the shard memory (step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the flow goes to step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to wait for the next data reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As obvious from the foregoing, in accordance with the communication control unit and the control method therefor in the first embodiment, when measured data notified from the control target card at a fixed time interval in a base station is stored in the shared memory, the measuring time is stored, and if there is a fear of data loss, the stored measuring time is referenced to determine the existence of data loss. Thereafter, in the event of occurrence of a data loss, the lost measured data is complemented. Accordingly, an effect of enabling recognition of the loss of measured data notified to the control unit is obtained, and an effect of enabling a countermeasure against the data loss to be taken is also obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, since the time of reception is stored in the shared memory along with measured data as a measuring time, such an effect is obtained that the existence of a measured data loss can easily be determined based on the stored measuring time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, since lost measured data is complemented by the measured data stored in the shared memory just before the switching and the measured data received just after the switching, such an effect is obtained that communication control such as power control can be exercised without hindrance in the event of occurrence of a data loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, since lost measured data is complemented by averaging the measured data stored in the shared memory just before the switching and the measured data received just after the switching, such an effect is obtained that the lost measured data can easily be complemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, if the control card is the call processing control card, the call control within the wireless base station apparatus is carried out by using the measured data group stored in the shared memory, so that such an effect is obtained that the call processing control can be performed without hindrance in the event of occurrence of a measured data loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further, if the control card is the maintenance management control card, the maintenance management within the wireless base station apparatus is performed by using the measured data group stored in the shared memory, so that such an effect is obtained that the maintenance management control can be performed without hindrance in the event of occurrence of a measured data loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Although the first embodiment has been explained as to the case in which a lost measured data is complemented, some necessary complementing process may be performed when exercising the power control or the like, using the measured data group accumulated in the shared memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the control method in a second embodiment. In this flowchart, steps ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are the same as those of the first embodiment, except that in step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, if&Dgr; T is larger than &agr;, that is, if a data loss occurs, blank data is created (step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). For instance, a value that cannot exist as measured data is created. And, the blank data is stored in the shared memory (step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the flow goes to step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to wait for the next data reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> And, when performing the power control or the like, the data. complementing unit is activated if data complementing is necessary. If data complementing is not necessary depending on the type of measured data or the communication condition, the activation of the data complementing unit is not performed. In either case, data loss can be recognized by the existence of the blank data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also in this second embodiment, when measured data notified from the control target card at every fixed time interval in the base station is stored in the shared memory, the measuring time is stored, and if there is a fear of data loss, the existence of a data loss is determined by referencing the stored measuring time. And, if a data loss occurs, the fact of the occurrence of a loss is shown by blank data. Accordingly, the measured data loss notified to the control unit can be recognized, and a countermeasure against the data loss can be taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the above first and second embodiments, although a construction is employed in which a data loss is determined when the active-mode control card malfunctions and the standby-mode control card is switched to the active-mode control card, data losses may be caused due to other sources. Thus, a construction maybe provided in which the existence of a data loss is determined each time measured data is received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the wireless base station apparatus and the control method therefor according to the present invention, when measured data notified at every fixed interval of time is stored in a memory, the measuring time is stored, and if there is a fear that data is lost, the existence of data loss is determined by referring to the stored measuring time, and if a data loss occurs, a countermeasure against the data loss is taken, so that they are suitable for a system which exercises communication control such as power control by using the measured data group accumulated in the memory. </paragraph>
