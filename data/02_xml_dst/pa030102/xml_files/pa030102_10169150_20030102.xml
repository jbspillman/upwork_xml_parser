<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an intake pressure detecting device for an internal combustion engine for detecting the intake pressure in an intake pipe of an internal combustion engine, or the like, and more particularly, to an intake pressure detecting device for an internal combustion engine suitable for detecting the intake pressure of an internal combustion engine, such as a two-cycle, single-cylinder, small exhaust capacity engine, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a four-cycle internal combustion engine mounted in an automobile, or the like, generally, an electronically controlled fuel injection system is employed for injecting fuel by means of electronic control. In this system, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> basic fuel injection amount is determined from the intake air volume flowing in the air valve and the rotational speed of the engine, and a fuel injection amount suited to respective operational states of the engine is determined, by making various increase corrections according to engine operation information, such as water temperature, intake air temperature, throttle opening, and the like, or by making an air/fuel ratio correction by detecting the amount of oxygen in the exhaust pipe by means of an oxygen sensor. As means for detecting the intake air volume, an intake negative pressure sensor type (D-jetronic) intake air pressure detecting device is known, and this intake air pressure detecting device is based on the principle that the engine charging efficiency is directly proportional to the intake pipe pressure, and hence it determines the absolute pressure in the intake pipe, and then determines the intake air volume by deriving the air density taken in from the found absolute pressure and the separately measured air temperature, on the basis of the Boyle-Charles law. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a four-cycle multiple cylinder engine mounted in an automobile, or the like, generally, a composition is adopted whereby one or two throttle valves, in other words, a number of throttle valves less than the number of cylinders, are provided on the upstream side of the intake path, in order to adjust the intake air volume, and the intake of air is routed to the plurality of cylinders via this one or two throttle valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this composition, if the degree of opening of the throttle valve is very slight, then the pressure in the intake pipe (intake pressure) is very low, for example, in some cases, it may be lower than approximately &minus;80 kPa (gauge pressure). If, on the other hand, the load on the engine is great and the throttle valve is completely open, then the pressure in the intake pipe will rise to practically atmospheric pressure, in other words, approximately 0 kPa (gauge pressure), or in engines equipped with a supercharger, it will be pressurized to approximately &plus;101.32 kPa (gauge pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an intake pressure detecting device for detecting the absolute pressure in an intake pipe of an engine of this kind is set so as to measure a range from approximately 20 kPa (absolute pressure) to approximately 106.7 kPa (absolute pressure), which is the atmospheric pressure level under high pressure conditions, or approximately 200 kPa (absolute pressure) in order to be compatible with a supercharged engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An intake pressure detecting sensor constituting an intake pressure detecting device of this kind has been developed, which operates with a single DC &plus;5V power source and also has an output voltage in the range of DC 0-5V, in order to achieve satisfactory interfacing, and which has the linear characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The conventional range of use of this intake pressure detecting sensor covers the wide region illustrated by S in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a system using the aforementioned intake pressure detecting sensor, the analogue signal of the output voltage corresponding to pressure detected by the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is converted to a digital signal by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as illustrated by the block diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and calculation of the intake air volume, and the like, is performed by a CPU <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the basis of this digital signal, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a 5V power supply <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> forming a reference voltage, and the analogue signal of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is converted to a-digital signal on the basis of this reference voltage. Here, if the resolution of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 8 bits, for example, then the input voltage in the range of 0-5V is converted to a digital value in the range of 0-255. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An engine mounted in a motorcycle, snowmobile, leisure boat, or the like, will often have fewer cylinders than an engine mounted in an automobile, or the like, and it may be a two-cycle engine instead of a four-cycle engine. Therefore, if a conventional intake pressure detecting device of the aforementioned kind is used directly in an engine mounted in a motorcycle, snowmobile, leisure boat, or the like, then problems of the following kind arise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in a motorcycle, snowmobile, leisure boat, or the like, in some cases, a throttle valve is provided for each cylinder in a multiple cylinder engine, in order to emphasize accelerator response. Therefore, the pressure inside the intake pipe increases markedly, in other words, the negative pressure in the intake pipe declines markedly, compared to cases where fewer throttle valves than the number of cylinders are provided, as in the prior art, and in a two-cycle single-cylinder engine having a small exhaust capacity, for example, the pressure in the intake pipe may only fall to approximately &minus;20 kPa (gauge pressure), at minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Consequently, if the conventional intake pressure detecting device is used directly, then in the narrow pressure range of &minus;20 kPa to 0 kPa (gauge pressure), the sensor output will have the narrow range indicated by L in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> (approximately 3.2-4.0V), and approximately &frac15; of the original measurement range will actually be used. Therefore, the detectable pressure range (1 LSB) will be a relatively large value of approximately 0.51 kPa, which means that the detection sensitivity will decline and control of the fuel injection amount of the engine, and the like, becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, assuming that the sensor output corresponding to the output range of &minus;20 kPa to 0 Kpa as described above is amplified directly, then the input voltage range of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can easily be exceeded, even at a low amplification factor, and hence pressure detection becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the resolution of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is increased, from 8 bits to 10 bits, for example, then it becomes possible to detect pressure change up to the level of approximately 0.13 kPa, but costs increase, software processing becomes more complicated, and the S/N ratio of the control circuit must be set to a high value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if used in a location of high altitude above sea level, such as in a snowmobile, it is necessary to use an intake pressure detecting sensor as an altimeter to measure atmospheric pressure, and furthermore, problems arise in that the measurement range of the intake pressure detecting sensor is narrowed due to the decline of the pressure in the intake pipe at high altitude, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention was devised with the foregoing problems of the prior art in view, an object thereof being to provide an intake pressure detecting device for an internal combustion engine whereby the pressure in the intake pipe can be detected to a high degree of sensitivity, and the fuel injection volume, and the like, can be controlled with high precision, whilst achieving cost reductions, by applying an intake pressure detecting sensor developed for use in an internal combustion engine mounted in an automobile, or the like, which obtains sufficient negative pressure in the intake pipe, to an internal combustion engine, such as a single-cylinder engine, small exhaust capacity engine, two-cycle engine, or the like, which does not obtain sufficient negative pressure in the intake pipe. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The intake pressure detecting device for an internal combustion engine according to the present invention is an intake pressure detecting device for an internal combustion engine for detecting the intake pressure in the intake pipe as information for controlling the operational state of the internal combustion engine, characterized in that it comprises: an intake pressure detecting sensor for detecting the absolute pressure of the intake air; a reference voltage power supply for supplying a prescribed reference voltage; a differential amplifier for amplifying the differential between the output voltage from the intake pressure detecting sensor and the reference voltage from the reference voltage power supply; and an A/D converter for converting the analogue signal output by the differential amplifier into a digital signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to this composition, firstly, the absolute pressure of the intake air in the internal combustion engine is detected by the intake pressure detecting sensor, and a voltage corresponding to the detected pressure is output. This output voltage and a reference voltage are input to the differential amplifier, which amplifies the differential therebetween by a prescribed amplification factor. The amplified analogue signal is routed to an A/D converter and converted to a digital signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> More specifically, by comparing the output voltage of the intake pressure detecting sensor with a prescribed reference voltage value, amplifying the differential therebetween and inputting same to an A/D converter, the pressure detection sensitivity is raised even in the case of an A/D converter having low resolution, and a sufficiently small value is obtained for 1 LSB (Least Significant Bit), in other words, the detectable pressure range. Consequently, even in the case of an internal combustion engine wherein the intake pressure does not fall very low, the intake pressure can be detected to a high degree of accuracy, and hence high-precision control of the fuel injection volume, or the like, can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing composition, it is possible to adopt a composition whereby the reference voltage of the reference voltage power supply is set to the same voltage as the output voltage output by the intake pressure detecting sensor when a prescribed pressure greater than a standard atmospheric pressure is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to this composition, even under conditions of high atmospheric pressure exceeding the standard atmospheric pressure, the output of the differential amplifier will not become 0V, and consequently, the input value to the A/D converter will not be clipped to 0V, and accurate intake pressure detection can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing composition, it is possible to adopt a composition which comprises reference voltage adjusting means capable of adjusting the reference voltage of the reference voltage power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to this composition, by adjusting the reference voltage adjusting means, it is possible to adjust the reference point in such a manner that the output of the differential amplifier becomes 0V, for example, in high pressure conditions exceeding the standard atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned composition, it is possible to adopt a composition which comprises amplification factor adjusting means capable of adjusting the amplification factor of the differential amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to this composition, by adjusting the amplification factor adjusting means, it is possible to adjust the amplification factor of the differential amplifier to a prescribed value, and hence circuit error, component variations, and the like, can be absorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the composition comprising the intake pressure detecting sensor, reference voltage power supply, differential amplifier, and A/D converter, it is also possible to adopt a composition which further comprises storing means for previously storing information relating to the signal output by the differential amplifier when a known prescribed pressure value is applied to the intake pressure detecting sensor; and calculation processing means for calculating the actual intake pressure on the basis of the storage information stored by the storing means and the detection information actually detected by the intake pressure detecting sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to this composition, by applying known prescribed pressure values, for example, at least two calibration pressure values, to the intake pressure detecting sensor, information relating to the signal output from the differential amplifier, in other words, the actual detection characteristics of the intake pressure detecting sensor and differential amplifier, are previously stored in the storing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If the intake pressure detecting device is incorporated into an actual system in this state and the intake pressure is detected, then the actual intake pressure is calculated by the calculation processing means on the basis of the information output via the intake pressure detecting sensor, differential amplifier and A/D converter, in other words, the detection information, and the storage information stored in the storing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Consequently, if there is a difference between the designed detection characteristics and the actual detection characteristics (namely, a difference between the designed detection characteristics and the actual detection characteristics due to variation in the characteristics of the intake pressure detecting sensor itself, or variation in the calculated resistance of the amplifier circuit, or the like,) then by performing progressive calibration on the basis of calculation processing, it is possible to detect the actual pressure, rather than the pressure based on the design value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing composition, it is possible to adopt a composition which comprises determining means for determining the presence or absence of an information write instruction to the storing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to this composition, since the determining means determines whether or not to issue an information write instruction to the storing means, if the determining means issues an instruction signal, for example, then digital information relating to the output signal from the differential amplifier based on known prescribed pressures is stored in the storing means, whereas if, on the other hand, the determining means issues a no instruction signal, then no storage operation to the aforementioned storing means is implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In other words, calibration data, and the like, can be written on the basis of the determining means, in an inspection process, or the like, during device manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing composition, it is possible to adopt a composition wherein the amplification factor of the differential amplifier is set within a range whereby the amplified output signal does not exceed the input range of the A/D converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By adopting this composition, it is possible to utilize the broad scope of the input range of the A/D converter, without saturation, and hence the intake pressure can be detected to a high degree of accuracy.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Below, an embodiment of the present invention is described on the basis of the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an approximate compositional view of one embodiment of an intake pressure detecting device for an internal combustion engine relating to the present invention. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relating to the present embodiment has a basic composition comprising an intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for detecting the absolute pressure (Pint) of the intake air in the intake pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the engine, a reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for supplying a prescribed reference voltage (Vref), a differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for amplifying the voltage difference (&Dgr;V) between the output voltage from the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in other words, the sensor voltage (Vin), and the reference voltage (Vref) of the reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for converting the analogue signal for output voltage (k&middot;&Dgr;V) amplified by a prescribed amplification factor (k) and output by the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to a digital signal, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is principally applied to a fuel injection control system for controlling the fuel injection volume in accordance with the operational state of the engine, and a control system of this kind comprises, in addition to the aforementioned intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forming a microcomputer for performing various computing processes, a ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> wherein control programs or control data are stored, a RAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for temporarily storing calculation results, or the like, during processing, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Here, the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> consists of a pressure sensor semiconductor (hybrid IC) comprising an integrated on-chip bipolar operating amp circuit and thin-film resistor network, and if pressure is applied to a silicon diaphragm formed on the silicon wafer of the IC, then an analogue signal which is directly proportional to the applied pressure is output, taking a vacuum pressure hermetically sealed behind the silicon diaphragm as a reference pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Therefore, if the intake pressure in the intake pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the engine is applied to the silicon diaphragm, the absolute pressure of the intake air can be detected. This intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operates by connection to a single DC &plus;5V power supply, and is set to an output voltage range of 0V-5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the output voltage (sensor voltage) with respect to the pressure at the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are linear characteristics as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>: for example, a signal of approximately 0.79V is output at 20.0 kPa (absolute pressure), approximately 3.23V at 81.3 kPa (absolute pressure), approximately 4.0V at 101.32 kPa (absolute pressure), and approximately 4.2V at 106.7 kPa (absolute pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is installed integrally inside an ECU (engine control unit) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which also contains the aforementioned CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, RAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and other peripheral electronic components, and the like, the intake pressure in the intake pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> being routed to the silicon diaphragm of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a pressure application pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this way, by installing the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> integrally in the ECU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is possible to perform calibration of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the like, during the ECU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> inspection process. The intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not limited to being installed in the ECU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described above, and it may also be disposed separately from the ECU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the sensor voltage Vin output by the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described above and the reference voltage Vref of the reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are input to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which amplifies the differential &Dgr;V between the two voltages (&equals;Vref&minus;Vin) by a prescribed amplification factor (k), and outputs an amplified signal k&middot;&Dgr;V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Here, to describe the circuitry relating to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in detail, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one end of a resistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having resistance RI is connected to a non-inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, together with one end of a resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is earthed. Furthermore, the other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to the reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplying the reference voltage Vref. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, is connected via a resistor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> having resistance RI to the output terminal of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and an sensor voltage Vin is input thereto, and one end of the resistor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the output terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected via a resistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned circuit, the output voltage Vout (in other words, k&middot;&Dgr;V) of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is expressed as Vout &equals;(R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&middot;(Vref&minus;Vin), and the amplification factor is k&equals;R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by selecting appropriate values for the two resistances R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is possible to amplify the differential &Dgr;V of the two voltages to a prescribed value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Here, the reference voltage Vref is set in such a manner that the input value to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is not clipped at 0V, and the amplification factor (k), namely, the voltage gain, is selected in such a manner that the maximum value of amplified signal, k&middot;&Dgr;V, in other words, the output voltage Vout, does not exceed the input range of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as discussed hereinafter, and that the input range is utilized to the maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, since the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs a signal of approximately 4.0V at 101.32 kPa (absolute pressure) and 4.2V at 106.7 kPa (absolute pressure), the reference voltage Vref is set to same voltage as the output voltage output by the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when an atmospheric pressure higher than the standard atmospheric pressure (101.32 kPa), in other words, a pressure greater than the atmospheric pressure at high pressure conditions in a low-altitude location, for example, a pressure of 106.7 kPa, is applied. More specifically, the reference voltage Vref is set to 4.2V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The reference voltage Vref is not limited to a value of 4.2V, and it is also possible to allow some surplus margin for the atmospheric pressure actually occurring in practical use under normal atmospheric conditions, and hence set the reference voltage Vref to the same voltage as the output voltage from the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when a pressure of 110.0 kPa or 112 kPa is applied. However, if the surplus margin is excessive, then the amplification factor will be restricted by consequence of the input range of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and hence a voltage value of 4.2V corresponding to the aforementioned pressure 106.7 kPa is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Here, supposing that the reference voltage Vref is set to the same voltage as the output voltage (4.0V) from the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when the standard atmospheric pressure is applied, then if the intake pressure Pint reaches a pressure exceeding the standard atmospheric pressure, in other words, if a state where the voltage at the non-inverting terminal is less than the voltage at the inverting input terminal occurs, amplification will not be possible with a single power supply, and the output of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will not change and will remain at 0V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In order to deal with such a situation, in the present invention, a reference voltage having a surplus margin corresponding to a pressure higher than the supposed value of the intake pressure Pint is set, and therefore, when the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is normal, the voltage at the non-inverting input terminal is always greater than the voltage at the inverting input terminal, and the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will always output a value greater than 0V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In other words, even if the intake pressure is a positive pressure, due to blow back of the intake air in the intake pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, or the like, it is still possible to detect the intake pressure accurately, without causing misdetection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the event that intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disconnected, or the like, since pull-up processing for performing control is generally implemented on the safe side of the engine (in the case of a two-cycle engine, for example, the excess fuel side, in order to prevent burning,) then a voltage greater than the reference voltage Vref will be input to the inverting input terminal via a pull-up resistor. Consequently, the non-inverting input terminal voltage will be less than that of the inverting input terminal, and the output from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be 0V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Thereby, if the output is 0V, then it is processed as a case where the wiring inside the input intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the wiring connected thereto has become disconnected. In other words, disconnection, or the like, of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be detected readily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> If the reference voltage Vref is set to 4.2V as described above and a graph of the differential &Dgr;V (&equals;Vref&minus;Vin) between the reference voltage Vref and the sensor voltage Vin of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is plotted, then the solid line &Dgr;V in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is obtained. As can be seen from these results, the range of the voltage output corresponding to the pressure range of 81.3 kPa-106.7 kPa (absolute pressure) is less than 1V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in order to enable reliable detection by using the broad scope of the input range (0V-5V) of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, described hereinafter, the application rate k is set to 5.0, for example. If the amplified output voltage Vout in this case, in other words, k&middot;&Dgr;V (&equals;5.0&times;(Vref&minus;Vin)), is plotted on a graph, the solid line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> By selecting the reference voltage Vref and amplification factor k in this way, it is possible to use the wide scope of the input range of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> used, without saturation, and in particular, it is possible to detect the intake pressure with high accuracy in a motorcycle, leisure boat, or the like, operated at a low-altitude location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case of a snowmobile, or the like, operated at a high altitude, if the amplification factor described above (k&equals;5.0) is used, then cases where the intake pressure cannot be detected may arise. More specifically, if the atmospheric pressure is measured using the aforementioned intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, then the sensor voltage Vin at an altitude of around 4000 m will be approximately 2.38V. Therefore, in order that the output voltage Vout of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> enters within the 5V input range of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in such a case, the amplification factor k must be set to approximately 2.75. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the pressure in the intake pipe during operation of the engine is lower than the aforementioned atmospheric pressure, then if this amplification factor (k&equals;2.75) is used and the snowmobile is used as a maximum altitude of 2500-3000 m above sea level, the intake pressure can be detected. If the snowmobile is operated at a higher altitude, then the amplification factor k must be set to a smaller value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If the amplification factor k is set to 2.75 as described above, and the amplified output voltage Vout, in other words, k&middot;&Dgr;V (&equals;2.75&times;(Vref&minus;Vin)) is plotted on a graph, then the solid line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Thus, by selecting the amplification factor k, it is possible to detect the intake pressure with good accuracy compared to the prior art, even in a location of high altitude above sea level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a 5V power supply is connected as a reference voltage. The analogue signal (k&middot;&Dgr;V) input from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is converted to a digital signal, indicating a discrete value, on the basis of this reference voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Here, the resolution of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is 8 bits, and consequently, the voltages in the range 0V-5V are previously assigned 255 (2<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>-1) binary codes, the analogue input signal from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is compared with the reference voltage, and the corresponding binary code is found and output as a prescribed digital signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In other words, looking at the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, if the amplification factor k is 5.0, then the amplified output voltage k&middot;&Dgr;V will range from 0V to approximately 4.85V, and hence a pressure range of 0.103 kPa (25.4 kPa/((4.85/5)&times;255)&equals;0.103 kPa) per LSB can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Thereby, it is possible to represent the intake pressure in a range of 81.3 kPa-101.32 kPa, for example, as approximately 194 engine states, compared to 39 states in the prior art. Consequently, the precision of engine control can be improved accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the amplification factor k is 2.75, then the amplified output voltage k&middot;&Dgr;V will range from 0V to approximately 2.67V, and hence a pressure range of 0.187 kPa (25.4 kPa/((2.67/5)&times;255)&equals;0.187 kPa) per LSB can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thereby, it is possible to represent the intake pressure in a range of 81.3 kPa-101.32 kPa, for example, as approximately 108 engine states, compared to 39 states in the prior art. Consequently, the precision of engine control can be improved accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Here, the resolution of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is taken as 8 bits, but it is also possible to a device having another bit number, such as 10 bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of an intake pressure detecting device relating to the present invention, wherein reference voltage adjusting means for adjusting the reference voltage of the reference voltage power supply is also provided in the embodiment described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the circuitry relating to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; relating to this embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, one end of a resistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the non-inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, along with one end of a resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is earthed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a power supply <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a prescribed voltage Vcc (for example, 5V) is provided, and a resistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a resistor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a variable resistor (potential trimmer) <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> having a variable resistance Rv are connected sequentially in series to the power supply <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and one end of the variable resistor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is grounded. The other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to the dividing point between the resistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The output terminal of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a resistor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, similarly to the foregoing embodiment, and the sensor voltage Vin is input thereto. The end of the resistor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the output terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected via a resistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned composition, the voltage Vx at the dividing point between the resistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a reference voltage Vref&prime; which is input to the non-inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This voltage Vx, namely, the reference voltage Vref&prime;, is determined by the ratio between the resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the resistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the resistance R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the resistor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> plus the resistance Rv of the variable resistor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, in other words, the ratio between R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&plus;Rv. Consequently, this ratio can be adjusted suitably by adjusting the variable resistor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and hence the value of the reference voltage Vref&prime; can be adjusted to a prescribed value, or it can be adjusted in such a manner that variation is absorbed so as to match a prescribed reference voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In other words, reference voltage adjusting means capable of adjusting the reference voltage of the reference voltage power supply is constituted by the aforementioned power supply <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, resistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, resistor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and variable resistor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows yet a further embodiment of an intake pressure detecting device relating to the present invention, and in this embodiment, amplification factor adjusting means for adjusting the amplification factor k of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the circuitry relating to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&Prime; relating to this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, one end of an resistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the non-inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, together with one end of a resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> being earthed. The other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to a reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplying a reference voltage Vref. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, is connected to a moving contact terminal of a variable resistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (potential trimmer) and one end of a capacitor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of capacitance C, which form amplification factor adjusting means. One end of this variable resistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected to the output terminal of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an resistor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the variable resistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected to the output terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a resistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the other end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> being connected to the output terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned composition, by adjusting the moving contact point of the variable resistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> appropriately, error in the circuitry, and the like, can be absorbed and the amplification factor k can be adjusted to a prescribed value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the respective embodiments described above, cases where reference voltage adjusting means and amplification factor adjusting means are provided, respectively and separately, are described, but it is of course possible for these means to be provided conjointly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the various embodiments described above, it is assumed that no negative voltage is handled and the input range is 0V-5V, the voltage differential &Dgr;V (&equals;Vref&minus;Vin) being amplified as a positive voltage, but the invention is not limited to the detailed composition described above, if the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is bipolar input type A/D converter, or if the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> itself is provided with a positive/negative power supply, or if the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has different output characteristics to those described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (central processing unit) forming the kernel of the control system is an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit microcomputer, or the like, and in addition to the intake pressure information output by the aforementioned A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, this CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also receives input of intake temperature information detected by an intake temperature sensor, engine revolution speed (number of revolutions) and crank position information detected by an crank angle sensor, throttle opening information detected by a throttle opening sensor, cooling water temperature information detected by a water temperature sensor, oxygen density information detected by an oxygen sensor, and the like, each of these information elements being A/D converted to a digital signal before input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A control program and control maps (control data), such as an air/fuel ratio map set previously by experimentation, an ignition timing map, and the like, are stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In other words, the CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> compares and calculates the data read from the ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the information for the respective sensors, whilst temporarily storing intermediate calculation results, and the like, in a RAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and it determines the engine operating conditions at each respective moment, in other words, it determines the optimum ignition timing, fuel injection volume, fuel injection timing, and the like, and outputs control signals to the injector, ignition coil, and the like, by means of an output interface circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The input signal from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> described above is the differential pressure of the pressure with respect to the reference voltage, rather than the absolute pressure of the intake air, and therefore the absolute pressure value of the intake air is calculated by performing a calculation which accounts for the pressure corresponding to the reference voltage Vref, and the intake air volume is determined by the Boyle-Charles law on the basis of the absolute intake pressure thus obtained and the intake temperature. The basic fuel injection volume is determined from the intake air volume and the engine revolution speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if reference voltage adjusting means are provided and the reference voltage Vref&prime; is adjusted appropriately, then information relating to the adjusted reference voltage Vref&prime; is previously read in, the absolute pressure value of the intake air is calculated by performing calculations which take account of the information thus input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> usually detects the absolute pressure of the intake air in the intake pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, but it is also able to detect the atmospheric pressure (absolute value) in conditions where the engine is not operating. Consequently, if the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&Prime; is used in the engine of a snowmobile, or the like, then the intake pressure detecting device can be used as an altimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Since two types of information can be detected by means of a single intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in this way, the requirement for sensor equipment is reduced accordingly, and the cost of the overall system can be reduced, in addition to which, the input ports of the A/D converter are not overly occupied, and the corresponding freed input port can be used effectively for other information. Furthermore, by detecting the pressure when the engine is idle as described above to find the atmospheric pressure (absolute value) under these conditions, it is possible to perform atmospheric pressure correction with respect to various elements of operating information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of a control system including the intake pressure detecting device relating to the present embodiment is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Firstly, when the pressure in the intake pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (having a relatively small negative pressure level) is detected by the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, this detection signal (sensor voltage) Vin is input to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The difference &Dgr;V between the reference voltage Vref (Vref&prime;) and the sensor voltage Vin is amplified by amplification factor k, and the output voltage Vout (namely, k&middot;&Dgr;V)&equals;k&middot;(Vref&minus;Vin) is output from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The amplified output voltage Vout is then input to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and converted to a digital signal. More specifically, by amplifying the difference between a prescribed reference voltage value and the output voltage of the intake pressure detecting sensor, and inputting this difference to an A/D converter, the pressure detection sensitivity is raised even in the case of a low-resolution A/D converter, and a sufficiently small value is achieved for the pressure range detectable per LSB (least significant bit). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The converted digital signal is input to the CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and subjected to prescribed conversion processing, whereupon it is entered into a calculation based on the Boyle-Charles law, together with the separately detected intake temperature-signal, in order to determine the intake air volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A basic fuel injection volume is determined according to the intake air volume thus calculated and the separately detected engine revolution speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The information from the various other sensors is compared with control maps (control data), such as air/fuel ratio maps, ignition timing maps, and the like, previously determined by experimentation, and entered into various calculations in order to determine the engine operating conditions, in other words, the optimum ignition timing, fuel injection volume, fuel injection timing, and the like, at each particular instant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The control signals thus calculated are output to the injector, ignition coil, and the like, by means of an output interface circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> According to the foregoing procedure, highly accurate control of the fuel injection volume, and the like, can be achieved, even in the case of an engine generating an intake pressure with a relatively low negative pressure level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> show a further embodiment of an intake pressure detecting device relating to the present invention, and in this embodiment, rather than providing adjusting means such as in the foregoing description, a prescribed reference voltage and amplification factor are used by means of fixed resistances, and during manufacture, variation information relating to the output of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (variation information for the individual intake pressure detecting sensor, and variation information for the computed resistance of the amplifying circuit), and the like, are stored electrically, and when detecting the actual intake pressure, this stored information is referenced to determined the actual intake pressure value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relating to the present embodiment has a basic composition consisting of an intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forming calculation processing means, an EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> forming storing means, and the like, and it also comprises a switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, or the like, as determining means for determining whether or not to instruct the CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to store information to the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> This intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is incorporated integrally in an ECU (engine control unit) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, together with a ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for storing control programs or control data, a RAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for temporarily holding intermediate calculation results, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned composition, the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, reference voltage power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, RAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the like, are the same as in the foregoing embodiments, and description thereof is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It is possible to use an electrically writable device as storage means for electrically storing the variation information for the output from differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the like. Therefore, a small-capacity, electrically erasable and writable EEPROM may be employed, as in the present embodiment, or alternatively; the information may be written separately to an internal ROM, by using a flash ROM type MPU (micro processing unit). A program is stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for writing the output signal sent from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, in addition to the various information described above in the foregoing embodiment, when the switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> forming the determining means is ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Device calibration tasks for the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are carried out in the inspection stage during manufacture. The design properties of the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are as illustrated by the dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Firstly, when a completely assembled intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is conveyed to the inspection stage, a calibration pressure source <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> disposed in the manufacturing line is connected to the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A first calibration pressure P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of 101.32 kPa, for example, (absolute pressure) is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Here, the first calibration pressure P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is desirably lower than the pressure corresponding to the reference voltage Vref, in other words, 106.7 kPa (absolute pressure). Supposing that this pressure of 106.7 kPa is applied, then if the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> exhibits fluctuation in such a manner that the sensor voltage output by the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes greater than the reference voltage Vref, it will be difficult to perform accurate calibration. Consequently, the first calibration pressure PI is desirably set to a lower pressure than the pressure corresponding to the reference voltage Vref. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Thereupon, when switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is turned ON, the CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines that there is a write instruction, and using the program stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, if the input value to A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is equal to or less than a prescribed threshold value (for example, 1V), then the A/D converted digital value A corresponding to the input value, and the pressure value, are stored as storage information 1 (pressure value: 106.7 kPa/digital value: A) in the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is then turned OFF, and another calibration pressure source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> disposed in the manufacturing line is connected to the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> instead of the calibration pressure source <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. A second calibration pressure P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of 81.3 kPa (absolute pressure), for example, is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When the switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is then turned ON, the CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines that there is a write instruction, and using the program stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, if the input value to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> exceeds a prescribed value (for example, 1V), then an A/D converted digital value B corresponding to this input value, and the pressure value, are stored as storage information 2 (pressure value: 81.3 kPa/digital value: B) in the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Thereupon, the switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is turned OFF, the calibration pressure source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is disconnected from the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the calibration data storage processing, in other words, the calibration work, terminates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Thereby, using the aforementioned storage information <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and storage information <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the actual characteristics of the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, namely, the characteristics of the straight line passing through points Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> illustrated by the solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In other words, by applying previously known prescribed pressure values, for example, at least the two calibration pressure values P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, information relating to the signal output from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in other words, the actual detection characteristics of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and differential amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are stored in advance in the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> forming storing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> If an intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which has completed calibration tasks as described above is applied to an engine and used in practice, then pressure detection is performed by the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and when a certain A/D converted value (digital value) is output, the actual intake pressure Pin is calculated by the CPU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forming calculation processing means, on the basis of this output value, in other words, the detection information, and the storage information stored previously in the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Consequently, if there is a difference between the designed detection characteristics and the actual detection characteristics (namely, a difference between the designed detection characteristics and the actual detection characteristics due to variation in the characteristics of the intake pressure detecting sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> itself, or variation in the calculated resistance of the amplifier circuit, or the like,) then by performing progressive calibration on the basis of calculation processing, it is possible to detect the actual pressure Pin, rather than the pressure Pin&prime; based on the design value, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, high-precision control can be implemented if the pressure information thus detected is used as a parameter for controlling the fuel injection volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present embodiment, by adopting a switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as determining means for determining whether or not an information write instruction is sent to the storing means, the storing operation to the EEPROM <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> forming the storing means can be performed reliably at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The intake pressure detecting device according to the present invention can of course also be achieved in a composition which does not incorporate determining means (switch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The other operations of the intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relating to this embodiment and the operations of the control system including this intake pressure detecting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are essentially the same as those relating to the previous embodiments, and hence further description thereof is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the intake pressure detecting device of the internal combustion engine relating to the present invention, it is possible to detect intake pressure with high accuracy, whilst achieving cost reductions, even in a two-cycle engine, small-exhaust capacity single-cylinder engine, or the like, having relatively small intake negative pressure, by using a commonly known intake pressure detecting sensor developed for use in an engine having a relatively large intake negative pressure, such as a four-cycle engine mounted in an automobile, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> By previously storing the detection characteristics of the intake pressure detecting device and comparing and calibrating the actual detection information on the basis of this stored information, it is possible to perform detection of even greater accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the fuel injection volume, and the like, of the engine can be controlled to a high degree of accuracy, in accordance with various operational states of the engine. </paragraph>
