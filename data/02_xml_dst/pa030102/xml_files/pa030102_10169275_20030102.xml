<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a mounting system for detachably mounting an item to a base member. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known to provide a mounting system for detachably mounting an item to a base member which includes a male element located on the item and a female element located on the base member. The female element is adapted to receive the male element. The male element includes a disc-like portion having a first flange extending radially outwardly to one side of the disc. The female element includes an aperture defining a circumferential second flange. The system operates such that when the male element is received in the female element, the first flange engages with the second flange and disengagement of the item from the base member when the item is subjected to a sudden impact force is restricted. The system also operates such that disengagement of the item from a base when manipulated by a user is permitted. Generally, the base member forms part of a work surface, a table or a heating portion of a stove and generally the item is a saucepan, jug or other household implement which is used to contain food or drink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While this system operates satisfactorily in restricting detachment of the item from the base when the item is subjected to a sudden impact force, it is possible that the item may become unintentionally detached from the base in some situations, for example when the item is subjected to random forces such as are typical in an aircraft or on a boat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks, therefore, among other things, to provide a mounting system which alleviates the above mentioned disadvantage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the drawings, there is shown an item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which may be a jug, a saucepan or any other household implement which is adapted to hold food or drink. The item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a handle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> engageable by a user, and a first engaging portion, in this example in the form of a male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forms part of a mounting system in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The mounting system also includes a second engaging portion, in this example in the form of a female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown more particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. The second engaging portion is formed in a base member, which may be a work surface, a table, a heating portion of a stove or part of any other article relative to which the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is desired to be retained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a first disc portion fixedly attached to a lower portion of the body portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> eccentrically fixed relative to the first disc portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to define a first flange portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which extends outwardly of the first disc portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may alternatively be integrally formed with the first disc portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes locking means, in this example in the form of a locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of generally I-shape transverse cross-section. The locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is movable relative to the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a direction substantially parallel to the plane of the second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between a first position wherein the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> locates relatively outwardly of the first and second disc portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> and a second position wherein the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> locates relatively inwardly of the first and second disc portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The locking means includes biasing means in the form of a spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> accommodated on a pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The biasing means biases the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> towards the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a top plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a bottom plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and an interconnecting portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The bottom plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the interconnecting portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> define a lip portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is received in and is movable relative to a recess <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed in the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is movable between the first and second positions by actuating means, in this example in the form of an actuating member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> pivotably connected at a pivot connection <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the handle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An end of the actuating member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> remote from the handle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is flexibly connected to an end of the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at a flexible connection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The arrangement is such that when a user grips the handle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and urges an upper portion of the actuating member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to pivot towards the user, the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is urged to move inwardly of the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the first position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> to the second position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a second flange portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> defining an aperture <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the aperture <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the second flange portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is such that the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is receivable in the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and such that the first flange portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fits snugly under and engages with the second flange portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is received in the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The configuration of the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also such that when the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in the first position and the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is engaged with the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the lip portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> fits snugly under and engages with the second flange portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so as to thereby prevent unwanted removal of the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the base member as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and when the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in the second position and the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is engaged with the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the lip portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> does not engage with the second flange portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and removal of the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the base member is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In use, when it is desired to engage the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the base member, a user grips the handle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and urges an upper portion of the actuating member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to pivot about the pivot connection <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> towards the user. As a result, the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is caused to move from the first position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> to the second position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. With the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the second position, the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be engaged with the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by introducing the first flange portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the second flange portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and manipulating the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> sits on and is generally parallel with the base portion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>To restrict removal of the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the base member, the user releases pressure from the upper portion of the actuating member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> thereby causing the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to move from the second position to the first position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by virtue of the biasing means. It will be understood that when the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is received in the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in the first position, the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is retained relative to the base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to remove the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the base member, the user grips the handle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and urges the upper portion of the actuating member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> towards the user thereby causing the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to move from the first position to the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that with the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> received in the female member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the second position, the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removable from the base member by manipulating the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>there are shown alternative arrangements for the male member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Like features are indicated with like reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in place of the second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are provided two flange portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>in place of the second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided a single flange portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of elongate configuration. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>in place of the second disc portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided a substantially rectangular flange portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. However, it will be appreciated that each of the alternative male members operates in the same way as the male member shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in that removal of the item is restrained by engagement of a fixed first flange portion and an adjustable locking member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a second flange portion provided in the base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that the configuration of the male and female members is preferably such that when the male member is received in the female member, the item <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotatable relative to the base member about an axis substantially perpendicular to the base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it will also be appreciated that although the above embodiments have been described in relation to a mounting system wherein a male member is provided on an item and a female member is provided on a base member, the invention is also applicable to a mounting system wherein a female member is provided on an item and a male member is provided on a base member. Of course, however, with such an alternative arrangement, the locking member would be movably mounted relative to the female member, biased inwardly of the female member and caused to move outwardly of the female member on actuation by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
