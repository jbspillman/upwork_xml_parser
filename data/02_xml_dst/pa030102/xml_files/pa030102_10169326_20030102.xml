<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A strip-like implant (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has a tape (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) with a first end (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and with a second end (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). In the area of at least one of the two ends (<highlight><bold>4, 6</bold></highlight>), a disk-like application aid (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) aligned with the plane of the tape (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is arranged.

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a strip-like implant which has a tape with a first end and with a second end, as well as a surgical gripping instrument with two jaws, which is set up to grip an implant tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Strip-like implants, e.g. in the form of resorbable or non-resorbable meshes or gauze strips (tapes), are used e.g. to support or bind tissue. When such an implant is to be used in a surgical operation, it is often necessary to guide one end area or both end areas of the implant through tissue. For this, a large area of tissue must usually be prepared, and after the implant has been applied and positioned, the usually not inconsiderable wound in the end area of the implant must be closed. This is time-consuming and stressful for the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to provide a possibility for guiding a strip-like implant quickly and gently through tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by a strip-like implant with the features of claim 1 as well as by a surgical gripping instrument with the features of claim 9. Advantageous versions of the invention are given in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The basic concept of the invention is a disk-like application aid with which a strip-like implant (implant tape) can be pulled through tissue. The disk-like application aid is arranged either in the area of one of the ends of the implant tape (claim 1) or constructed as jaws of a surgical instrument (claim 9), both of which have the same effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The strip-like implant according to the invention has a tape with a first end and with a second end. A disk-like application aid aligned with the plane of the tape is arranged in the area of at least one of the two ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The disk-like application aid reinforces the end area of the tape and thus enables the tape to be pulled through tissue with the help of a gripping instrument. In the process, the application aid provides the tissue quickly and gently with an opening which is no larger than is absolutely necessary for pulling through the tape. Thus an extensive tissue preparation is dispensed with. With the help of the application aid, only the area of tissue which is also actually required to position the strip-like implant is prepared. The specific placing of the implant is guaranteed by means of the application aid as required by the surgeon. In particular, the implant can lie flat without difficulty, if it is to lie uniformly flat. Similarly, if desired, the implant can also be inserted twisted. Through the disk-like application aid which is aligned with the plane of the tape (i.e. runs essentially parallel to the plane of the tape), the end area of the tape is thus constructed so that the implant can be pulled through the desired tissue or lengthwise between two layers of tissue without major problems. Almost automatically, tissue is prepared only for the area that is required for the implant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> All resorbable or non-resorbable materials suitable for the medical field can be considered as material for the tape. Mixtures of resorbable and non-resorbable materials are also conceivable. For the disk-like application aid, non-resorbable materials such as metals, plastics and ceramics are particularly suitable; in principle, however, resorbable materials can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Application areas are e.g. the augmentation of tendon sutures or the strength support in the case of abdominal wall defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the maximum width of the application aid measured perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tape is at least as great as the width of the tape in the area of the application aid. With this version, the opening required for pulling the tape through tissue can be wholly created by means of the application aid without the edges of the tape cutting into the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Numerous designs are conceivable for the application aid. For one version, the application aid is designed as a one-piece disk which is attached to one side of the tape. In another version, the application aid is designed as a double disk, both parts of which are attached to opposite sides of the tape and enclose the tape between them. The application aid, that is e.g. the one-piece disk or both parts of the double disk, can be attached to the tape using clips or adhesive. Depending on the material, it is also conceivable to weld the application aid to the end area of the tape. Another possibility is to pour the material for the application aid, e.g. a melted plastic or a plastic which has not yet been cured, round the end area of the tape and in doing so fully shape the application aid. Similarly, the end area of the tape can be reinforced by melting on the application aid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the application aid is circular, elliptical, oval or rhombic in the plane of the tape, but other forms are also possible. In a particularly preferred version, the application aid is a double disk with two round halves of the same size, the diameter of which is greater than the width of the tape, the end area of the tape being arranged between the two halves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The application aid can have an atraumatically designed edge and/or a cutting edge. It can be achieved by the design of the edges of the application aid that, when the implant is pulled through tissue, the application aid cuts the tissue gently only where it is absolutely necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The disk-like application aid can achieve the same effect if it is not integrated into a strip-like implant but rather forms a part of a surgical gripping instrument which serves for pulling through a conventional strip-like implant. Such a surgical gripping instrument has two jaws and is set up to grip an implant tape. The two jaws are designed as a disk-like application aid aligned to the plane of the tape when gripping the tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the two jaws are each designed as small disks between which the tape can be gripped. When the end area of a conventional mesh strip or implant tape is clamped between the two jaws of the surgical gripping instrument according to the invention, the same effect is achieved as when the disk-like application aid of a strip-like implant according to the invention is gripped with a conventional forceps-like operating instrument. When the operating instrument according to the invention is used, the opening in the tissue required for pulling through the implant tape is created by the two jaws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To prevent the end area of an implant tape gripped by the surgical gripping instrument from slipping out of the jaws, preferably, clamping means project from at least one of the two jaws, directed towards the other jaw. These can be e.g. one or more spikes or teeth, interlocking teeth or a corrugation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least one of the two jaws is circular, elliptical, oval or rhombic in the plane of the tape. In a preferred design, the two jaws have the same outline. The surgical gripping instrument is advantageously used with implant tapes the width of which is at most as great as the dimension of the jaws in the direction of the width of the implant tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the same way as the application aid of the strip-like implant according to the invention preferably has an atraumatically designed edge and/or a cutting edge, in the surgical gripping instrument according to the invention preferably at least one of the two jaws has an atraumatically designed edge and/or a cutting edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the following, the invention is explained in more detail using embodiments. The Figures show in </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, various versions of a strip-like implant <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are shown in which, for simplicity&apos;s sake, the same reference numbers are used for similar parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Each of the strip-like implants <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a first end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a conventional mesh strip of implantable material and can be resorbable or non-resorbable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the area of the first end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in all cases, a disk-like application aid in the form of a one-piece disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached on the upper side of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in an end zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as can be seen in particular in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The versions according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are in addition provided with a corresponding small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the area of the second end <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In principle, a disk-like application aid can be attached in the area of one or in the area of both ends of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is stuck or clipped onto the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the end zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Combinations of these means of attachment or other means of attachment, such as e.g. melting on, are also conceivable. The small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists preferably of metal, plastic or ceramic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The versions of the strip-like implant <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differ in the design of the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a circular outline and a somewhat greater diameter than the width of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the version according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the diameter of the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponds to the width of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) shows a small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an elliptical outline, the greatest expanse of which is aligned with the width of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is the same as the width. In the version according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shaped and aligned similarly, but wider than the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) shows a rhombic small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is somewhat wider than the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the small disks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are aligned with the plane of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and relatively flat. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a version is shown with a small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the front edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of which is constructed as a cutting edge. In the version according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the front edge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is blunt and atraumatic whilst the shape of the front edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is in between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, further versions for strip-like implants are shown, each here numbered <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. Otherwise, for simplicity&apos;s sake, the same reference numbers are used for similar parts, which, when possible, are the same as those from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The versions according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> differ from the versions according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> in the design of the disk-like application aid here numbered <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> encloses an end zone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. There are different possible ways of achieving this. Thus, the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be constructed as a double disk, the two parts of which are attached on opposite sides of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and enclose the tape between them. A recess to house the end zone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be provided on the insides of the disks so that the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can have a smooth edge as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. It is also conceivable to pour the material for the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> round the end zone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the area of the first end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or the second end <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to fully shape the application aid and then carry out a curing (e.g. by cooling from the melt or by chemical reaction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The versions according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> differ in the design of the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Its shape is circular in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) (the diameter being greater than the width of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), circular in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) (the diameter being the same as the width of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), elliptical in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) (the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being wider in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) than the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and rhombic in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows that in these versions the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is arranged essentially symmetrical to the plane of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is flat overall. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a version with an atraumatically shaped front edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) a version with a cutting front edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) a version with a front edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the shape of which lies between these two extremes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to insert one of the strip-like implants <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; into tissue, the application aid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is gripped with a surgical gripping instrument such as e.g. a forceps and pressed against one side of the tissue so that the front edge of the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or of the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (e.g. the edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) comes to lie freely against this side of the tissue. The small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can then be pressed through the tissue using the gripping instrument and, as soon as a part of it has emerged on the other side of the tissue, be pulled through the tissue by gripping this part with the gripping instrument, the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> following. The opening created in the tissue in this way causes the patient little discomfort as it is matched well to the size of the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is guided through the tissue, the small disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the application aid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be cut off. Afterwards, the procedure with the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is as per usual for the operating technique concerned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, sharp-pointed forceps can be used as a gripping instrument, these being pushed through the tissue in order to grip the application aid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moved to the other side of the tissue. Subsequently, using the forceps, the application aid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the following tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are pulled through the tissue. In this way, the forceps initially ensure a small opening in the tissue, this then being increased by the application aid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the size required for pulling through the tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, another possibility for an application aid is shown. The distal area of a surgical gripping instrument <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a first jaw <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a second jaw <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown in perspective view, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) with opened jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) with closed jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The two jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected to each other in articulated manner at the distal end of a shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and can be swivelled against each other via a mechanism not shown in more detail and guided in the shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are designed so that they form a disk-like application aid when closed, thus e.g. have a similar overall shape to the small disks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> or the application aids <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The surgical gripping instrument <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is set up to grip an implant tape, for which reason the insides of the jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are preferably generally flat, but provided with clamping means in order to prevent the implant tape from slipping out. On the inside of the first jaw <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the version of the surgical gripping instrument <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has a plurality of spikes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> opposite which, in the second jaw <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, recesses <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are arranged, in which the spikes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> engage when the jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are closed. In the embodiment, both the front edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the first jaw <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and its side edges are cutting edges. The edges of the second jaw <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are designed correspondingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the surgical gripping instrument <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with opened jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> opposite the end area of a conventional implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is clamped between the jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> running as an extension of the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this way, it is possible to pull the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or also to pull it through tissue after the end zone of the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has already passed through the tissue. On the other hand, to create an opening for the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the tissue, the surgical gripping instrument <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must be applied differently, i.e. rotated by approximately 180&deg;. Then the front edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> points towards the tissue and the closed jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as well as the following implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be pressed through the tissue, in a similar way to that described previously in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the gripping instrument <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be used with closed jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (and without the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) in order to create an opening at the desired position in the tissue. Subsequently, the closed jaws <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are pushed through this opening in order to be able to grip the implant tape <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moved to the opposite side of the tissue and to pull it through the opening in the configuration according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
