<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, particularly for molded case power circuit breakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known that molded case power circuit breakers are normally used in industrial low-voltage electrical systems, i.e., systems operating at up to approximately 1000 Volt. Said circuit breakers are usually provided with a system which ensures the nominal current required for the various users, the connection and disconnection of the load, protection against any abnormal conditions, such as overloading and short-circuit, by automatically opening the circuit, and the disconnection of the protected circuit by opening the moving contacts with respect to the fixed contacts (galvanic separation) in order to achieve full isolation of the load with respect to the electric power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The critical function of interrupting the current (whether nominal, overload or short-circuit current) is provided by the circuit breaker in a specific portion of said circuit breaker which is constituted by the so-called deionizing arc chamber. As a consequence of the opening movement, the voltage between the contacts causes the dielectric discharge of the air, leading to the forming of the electric arc in the chamber. The arc is propelled by electromagnetic and fluid-dynamics effects inside a series of metal plates arranged in the chamber, which are meant to extinguish said arc by cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> During arc forming, the energy released by Joule effect is very high and causes thermal and mechanical stresses inside the plate containment region. In order to withstand these stresses, the design of the arc chamber must be evaluated carefully so as to obtain a component which is solid enough to withstand the mechanical stresses and clearly defined so as to appropriately guide the arc into the extinguishing region while providing protection of the regions that must not be affected. Also, it is a common practice to include in the arc chamber elements made of insulating materials capable of emitting gaseous substances in the presence of an electric arc. Such substances interact with the plasma ions generated by the arc, thereby contributing to the reduction of overall phenomenon by reducing the conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate a typical example of an arc chamber of the prior art. The chamber generally comprises two side walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of insulating material, a plurality of metallic plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and at least one protective element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made of insulating material. The plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are generally U-shaped and have, at their outer lateral edges, a plurality of protrusions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The side walls <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> have a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which are suitable to mate with the corresponding protrusions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) for plate positioning and fixing. Plate fixing is provided, for example, by upsetting the protrusions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thus ensuring containment of the plates and mechanical stability of the arc chamber. Once assembled, the arc chamber is inserted in an appropriately provided space formed in the case of the circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although this solution adequately meets the necessary requirements, it is not entirely satisfactory in terms of the number of components required and of manufacturing complexity. In addition to the side walls made of insulating material, it is in fact also necessary to provide appropriate components (for example the protective element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) for arc guiding/protection. Furthermore, the fact must not be ignored that adequate mechanical stability is ensured only by virtue of the complicated operation of fixing the plates to the side walls, for example by upsetting the protrusions that are present on the edges of the plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The aim of the present invention is to provide an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, which is constituted by a limited number of components which is smaller than the number of components of conventional arc chambers. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, which does not require complicated assembly steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, which has adequate mechanical stability without requiring complicated mechanical processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, which can be easily assembled inside the pole of the circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, which does not require the use of additional elements capable of emitting gaseous substances which reduce the arc-related phenomena. Another object of the present invention is to provide an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers which is highly reliable, relatively easy to manufacture and at competitive costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This aim, these objects and others which will become apparent hereinafter are achieved by an arc chamber for low-voltage circuit breakers, characterized in that it comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> multiple substantially U-shaped metallic plates; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> an enclosure made of insulating material which is substantially shaped like a parallelepiped and comprises two side walls, a bottom wall, a top wall and a rear wall, said side walls having, on the inside, multiple mutually opposite slots for the insertion of said metal plates, the bottom and top walls each having an opening, said enclosure being open at the front. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this manner, one has the advantage of providing a mechanically stable arc chamber with a reduced number of components and of avoiding the complex mechanical operation of upsetting.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further characteristics and advantages of the arc chamber according to the invention will become apparent from the description of a preferred but not exclusive embodiment, illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, wherein: </paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the arc chamber according to the invention, which is shown disassembled for the sake of clarity, comprises a plurality of metal plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which are substantially U-shaped. The arc chamber furthermore comprises an enclosure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> made of insulating material which is substantially shaped like a parallelepiped, with two side walls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a bottom wall <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a top wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a rear wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The enclosure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is open at the front wall so as to allow the insertion of the plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as described in detail hereinafter. The side walls are internally provided with a plurality of mutually opposite slots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for the sliding insertion of the metal plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The bottom wall has at least one opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to allow the passage of the arc quenching contact. Conveniently, the top wall has at least one opening <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which allows the venting of the gases that are generated. The lower wall <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the top wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the rear wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> also protect the regions that must not be affected by the arc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The assembly of the arc chamber thus conceived is therefore greatly facilitated, the only necessary operation being the insertion of the plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the slots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, according to a preferred embodiment of the arc chamber according to the invention, the slots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> cover only a portion of the internal surface of the side walls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> rather than its entire length. Correspondingly, the metal plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> have two lateral arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which form the arms of the U-shape, and a solid bottom portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which is approximately as wide as the distance between the side walls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or, more generally, is shaped so as to correspond to the internal profile of the side walls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The width of the plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the lateral arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to the distance between the end surfaces of two mutually opposite slots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the metal plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> have at least one raised portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at at least one of the lateral arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, preferably at both arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted in a pair of mutually opposite slots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, said raised portion mechanically contrasts with the internal surfaces of the slot, ensuring that the position is maintained during assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the length of the lateral arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is greater than the length of the slots <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, so that the lateral arms at least partly protrude frontally from the body of the enclosure made of insulating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment, the rear wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the arc chamber according to the invention has a shaped protrusion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Conveniently, the protrusion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which runs along at least one portion of the rear wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a shaped raised portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the upper end of the rear wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The protrusion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the dimensions of the arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> facilitate the assembly of the arc chamber inside the pole and contribute to the containment of the plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The arc chamber according to the invention is in fact conveniently applied in a pole of a low-voltage circuit breaker and is particularly suitable for low-voltage molded case power circuit breakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a plan view of a pole of a low-voltage circuit breaker which comprises an arc chamber according to the invention. According to a general embodiment, the pole comprises a case <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> made of insulating material, inside which there is an arc chamber according to the invention. In the case of low-voltage molded case power circuit breakers, the case <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is constituted by the molded plastic case of said circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in which a single pole is shown for the sake of simplicity, the case <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has, on its internal surface, a shaped profile <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> which is suitable to mate with the protrusion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the shaped raised portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the arc chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the case <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has an additional internal shaped profile <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is suitable to mate complementarily with the front end of the arms <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which protrude from the body of the enclosure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Additional internal protrusions <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, suitable to facilitate the containment of the enclosure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, can furthermore be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the case <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the pole, which is structurally suitable to withstand intense mechanical stresses, contributes to the mechanical containment of the metal plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the arc chamber assembly includes a number of substantially U-shaped metal plates. The enclosure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is substantially shaped like a parallelepiped and has two side walls <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a bottom wall (not shown), a top wall <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a rear wall <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. As shown in the figure, the top wall <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> which allows the venting of the gases. The side walls <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are internally provided with a plurality of mutually opposite slots for the sliding insertion of the metal plates <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the slots cover the whole portion of the internal surfaces of the side walls <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the mounting is such that the arms of the U-shaped metal plates are directed inwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> represents a further embodiment of an enclosure <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of an arc chamber according to the invention. Also in this case, the enclosure has two side walls <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, a bottom wall <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, a top wall <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and a rear wall <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The side walls are internally provided, along the whole surfaces, with a plurality of mutually opposite slots <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> for the insertion of the metal plates (not shown). Openings <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> are present in the bottom and top walls, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to a further embodiment of the invention, the enclosure can be made of an insulating material, which includes compounds capable of emitting gaseous substances in the presence of an electric arc, said substances being capable to interact with the plasma ions, thereby reducing the arcing phenomena and related consequences. Examples of such substances are cellulose, melamine, acetalic resins, allumina trihydrate (ATH), fluorinated resins and/or compounds, metal hydrates, unsaturated polyester, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this way it is possible to avoid using the additional elements normally used in the art. Also, since the overall surface capable of emitting such gases is greater than in the arc chambers of the known types (basically the whole surface of the enclosure is capable of emitting such gases), the performances are by far better than in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In practice it has been found that the arc chamber according to the invention fully achieves the intended aim and objects, since it is constituted by a reduced number of components which can be assembled simply, avoiding complicated mechanical upsetting operations. In the proposed embodiment, the only components are the metal plates and the insulating enclosure, which can be assembled automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Mechanical stability is not compromised. As shown, when the arc chamber is inserted in the pole of a circuit breaker, the walls of said pole can contribute to the mechanical containment of the plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The use of compounds capable of emitting gaseous substances reduces the extent of the arcing phenomena, and consequently reduces also the mechanical stresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The arc chamber thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the inventive concept; all the details may furthermore be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. In practice, the materials used, so long as they are compatible with the specific use, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to the requirements and the state of the art. </paragraph>
