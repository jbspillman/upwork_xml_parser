<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Rearview and sideview mirror systems are widely used in motor vehicles, such as cars and trucks, to enable the driver to view the rear or side of the vehicle and to monitor the activities of passengers, such as children in the rear seat of a vehicle. Traditionally, rearview mirrors and sideview mirrors are located on the inside of the front windshield and on the sides of a vehicle. All such rearview mirrors and sideview mirrors include a blind spot where the driver cannot accurately view a portion of the area around the vehicle, necessitating the driver to turn his/her head to view the rear portion of the vehicle. Furthermore, in many instances where children are located in the rear seat of a vehicle, it is difficult to monitor the children using a rearview mirror, especially since the rearview mirror has been adjusted for driving and not for viewing the rear seat of a vehicle. In a situation where children are located in the rear seat of a vehicle, a driver must turn his/her head to monitor the behavior of the children. In most traffic conditions, driving a vehicle while trying to view the rear of a vehicle is an awkward task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a rearview vision system that is easily accessed by the driver of a vehicle and can be switched between multiple perspectives of difficult viewing areas in and around a vehicle. Furthermore, there is a need for system and method for viewing the interior of a vehicle to monitor children or other activities within the vehicle. Further still, there is a need for a system and method for improving the quality, visibility, or perspective of images displayed by such systems. Further yet, there is a need for a system and method for improving both audio and visual communication between a front seat passenger and a rear seat passenger in a vehicle. There is also a need for providing convenient and easy-to-use operator controls for such systems. There is also a need for an improved vehicle camera system to provide images of areas in and around the vehicle. The teachings hereinbelow extend to those embodiments which fall within the scope of the appended claims, regardless of whether they accomplish one or more of the above-mentioned needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown equipped with a video system or vision enhancement system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a car, truck, or other vehicle. The vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a rear <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, an interior <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an exterior <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, wherein the interior includes front seats <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a chimsel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Vehicle exterior <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> generally refers to areas surrounding vehicle interior <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and/or the exterior surfaces of vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The video system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a video control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, one or more lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (e.g., rear seat lights), and a camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (e.g., a rearview camera unit). The video control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably mounted in the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> cabin in a bezel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> attached to the roof of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; thus, control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted in the forward viewing perspective of a driver. The video control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that may be switched from a video input or signal provided by a camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> viewing the vehicle interior <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (e.g., the rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, other portions of the vehicle interior, etc.) of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a video signal provided by the rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or another camera unit which views exterior <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the vehicle. The video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, because of its ergonomic positioning, allows the driver or other front seat passenger of a vehicle to easily view the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while driving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An operator input device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (e.g., button, switch, dial, clickable icon on display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, etc.) activates the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a default mode wherein the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives and displays the video signal from the rearview camera <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a liquid crystal display (&ldquo;LCD&rdquo;) with the ability to display analog or digital video inputs, although any video display (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED) display, a cathode ray tube (CRT), etc.) is considered within the scope of this invention. Thus, cameras <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be any type of digital or analog camera. Video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be any shape, such as square, rectangular, or elliptical, and may have a surface area of between 8.75 in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 12 in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or other sizes. Furthermore, the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in alternate embodiments, may also be electronically configured or reconfigured to display vehicle operation and/or trip data from an onboard controller or computer such as mileage, compass heading, tire pressure, fuel efficiency data, outside/inside temperature, etc., but is not limited to such. Such data may be received from sensors positioned at various locations on the vehicle, and may be received via a wired or wireless connection (e.g., radio frequency, infrared, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the rear seat lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are mounted to the roof of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> proximate the sides of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and provide ambient light to the rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to allow the rear seat camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to provide a well-illuminated picture of the rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in low light conditions. Alternatively, lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be mounted anywhere on vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and may be configured to provide illumination to any area of vehicle interior <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be viewed by camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be mounted alone or in a housing or bezel containing one or more of lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a rear speaker for an audio system, a coat hook, and a task light or map light. Lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the rear speaker, and the task light may further have ON/OFF switches associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, at least one of the rear seat lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be automatically turned on when the rear seat camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is switched on using the button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, but any number or combination of lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> switched on is considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, at least one of rear seat lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be automatically switched off when the rear seat camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is switched off using button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A manual override control comprising a pushbutton dial <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will allow the driver to turn the rear seat lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on and off by pushing the pushbutton dial <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and will allow the driver to adjust the amount of light generated by the rear seat light by dialing the pushbutton dial <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In further embodiments, a light sensor may be used to disable the automatic operation of the rear seat light <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during daylight or high light conditions. The light sensor may include a light sensor circuit comprising the necessary analog or digital logic, software code, etc. to perform the operation of disabling the automatic operation of rear seat light <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may include any type of light source, such as fluorescent bulbs, incandescent bulbs, infrared, ultraviolet, a sconce light, an LED, etc. Lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably provide a light source easily detectable by camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. According to one advantageous feature, the light source provides light in the infrared range. Since infrared light is not visible light, passengers in the rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as children, will not be disturbed or awakened by the presence of the light. Since camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be configured to detect infrared light, the video signals provided by camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will result in enhanced, easy-to-view images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, video control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted in the same bezel or other housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. By mounting camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a forward viewing perspective of the driver of the vehicle, or otherwise in the front of the vehicle, the view of rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a better picture quality (e.g., angle) than if camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> were mounted closer to seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also, since video control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted in the roof or headliner in this exemplary embodiment, the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are closer to the front seat passengers, such as the driver, for ease of use and clarity of sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted at least partially in a housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (e.g., a chimsel) to provide images below the sightline of a rearview mirror or images normally out of sight of a driver looking towards the rear of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A chimsel or CHMSL (Center High Mounted Stop Lamp) is a brake light housing mounted to a vehicle in or near an area of the forward visual field toward which a following driver most often glances. The chimsel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes brake lights and the necessary electrical connections to operate the brake lights and the rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fully integrated to or fully contained within the chimsel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to have an aesthetically appealing physical configuration free of unsightly protrusions normally found in traditional vehicle camera systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides video signals that detail the rear area of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Many objects such as bikes, pets or toys may lie hidden directly below the back of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, producing a situation where the driver may back the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto such objects. The rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> enables the driver to view these previously hidden areas or blind spots to avoid such an occurrence. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the video signal of the rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will automatically be displayed on the video display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in reverse via a gearshift lever or other suitable operator input device. The rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes one or more rear lights <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to illuminate the rear of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with light directed at the hidden areas or blind spots. Rear lights <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may include any type of light source, such as fluorescent bulbs, incandescent bulbs, infrared, ultraviolet, sconce lights, LEDs, etc. Lights <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> preferably provide a light source easily detectable by camera <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The rear lights <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will be automatically switched on when the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in reverse but may be manually overridden and adjusted by pushbutton dial <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A light sensor may also be included to disable the rear lights <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in daylight or in a high light condition. The rearview camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further includes a lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to slightly diffuse the light generated by rear lights <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to allow greater illumination of the rear of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An aperture or window <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed in the lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to allow the rear camera unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to bypass the interference of the lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the video control panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes various other controls or operator input devices such as an audio system control or input device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Upon activation of the audio system control <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, audio input generated by a driver or front passenger to the microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will be measured and compared to a threshold level using a microcontroller or microprocessor. If the audio input is greater than the threshold level, then audio output to front speakers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> mounted in the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (e.g., from a radio, CD player, or other audio system) will be attenuated (the volume will be reduced) and the audio input to the microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will be switched to rear speakers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> mounted in the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the voice of a driver will be easily heard by passengers seated in the rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, via microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and rear speakers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, an integrated audio/visual system is provided. A vision enhancement system in one or more of the above-mentioned embodiments is integrated with an audio system. The vision enhancement system includes camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and an operator input device, such as audio system control <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In response to operator input (e.g., a button press, oral command, etc.), the vision enhancement system and the audio system are both activated. For example, camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may begin providing video signals to generate an image on display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and microphone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may begin transmitting audible signals from a passenger in the front seat to a passenger in the rear seat, or vice-versa, via front- or rear-mounted speakers. Rear-mounted speakers may be provided near lights <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or in another location near rear seats <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this integrated audio/visual system, a single operator input may activate both a video system and an audio system to allow communication between a front seat passenger and a rear seat passenger. Alternatively, if one of the video and audio systems is already activated, the single operator input may activate the other of the video and audio systems. Further, a single operator input may deactivate both the video and audio systems. The activation and deactivation may occur substantially simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the Figures and described above are presently preferred, it should be understood that these embodiments are offered by way of example only. For example, while the cameras, speakers, lights and operator input devices are coupled to various portions of the vehicle, alternative locations for these elements are contemplated. Further, the materials and structures shown and described herein may be replaced with other suitable materials and structures. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to a particular embodiment, but extends to various modifications that nevertheless fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
