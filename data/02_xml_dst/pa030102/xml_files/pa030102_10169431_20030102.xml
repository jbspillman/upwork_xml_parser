<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for achieving a compliant, solderless or soldered interconnect between a flexible circuit member and one or more other circuit members. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The current trend in connector design for those connectors utilized in the computer field is to provide both high density and high reliability connectors between various circuit devices. High reliability for such connections is essential due to potential system failure caused by misconnection of devices. Further, to assure effective repair, upgrade, testing and/or replacement of various components, such as connectors, cards, chips, boards, and modules, it is highly desirable that such connections be separable and reconnectable in the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Pin-type connectors soldered into plated through holes or vias are among the most commonly used in the industry today. Pins on the connector body are inserted through plated holes or vias on a printed circuit board and soldered in place using conventional means. Another connector or a packaged semiconductor device is then inserted and retained by the connector body by mechanical interference or friction. The tin lead alloy solder and associated chemicals used throughout the process of soldering these connectors to the printed circuit board have come under increased scrutiny due to their environmental impact. Additionally, the plastic housings of these connectors undergo a significant amount of thermal activity during the soldering process, which stresses the component and threatens reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The soldered contacts on the connector body are typically the means of supporting the device being interfaced by the connector and are subject to fatigue, stress deformation, solder bridging, and co-planarity errors, potentially causing premature failure or loss of continuity. In particular, as the mating connector or semiconductor device is inserted and removed from the present connector, the elastic limit on the contacts soldered to the circuit board may be exceeded causing a loss of continuity. These connectors are typically not reliable for more than a few insertions and removals of devices. These devices also have a relatively long electrical length that can degrade system performance, especially for high frequency or low power components. The pitch or separation between adjacent device leads that can be produced using these connectors is also limited due to the risk of shorting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another electrical interconnection method is known as wire bonding, which involves the mechanical or thermal compression of a soft metal wire, such as gold, from one circuit to another. Such bonding, however, does not lend itself readily to high-density connections because of possible wire breakage and accompanying mechanical difficulties in wire handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An alternate electrical interconnection technique involves placement of solder balls or the like between respective circuit elements. The solder is reflown to form the electrical interconnection. While this technique has proven successful in providing high-density interconnections for various structures, this technique does not facilitate separation and subsequent reconnection of the circuit members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An elastomeric material having a plurality of conductive paths has also been used as an interconnection device. The conductive elements embedded in the elastomeric sheet provide an electrical connection between two opposing terminals brought into contact with the elastomeric sheet. The elastomeric material must be compressed to achieve and maintain an electrical connection, requiring a relatively high force per contact to achieve adequate electrical connection, exacerbating non-planarity between mating surfaces. Location of the conductive elements is generally not controllable. Elastomeric connectors may also exhibit a relatively high electrical resistance through the interconnection between the associated circuit elements. The interconnection with the circuit elements can be sensitive to dust, debris, oxidation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, and other environmental elements that may adversely affect the connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The problems associated with connector design are multiplied when multiple integrated circuit devices are packaged together in functional groups. The traditional way is to solder the components to a printed circuit board, flex circuit, or ceramic substrate in either a bare die silicon integrated circuit form or packaged form. Multiship modules, ball grids, array packaging, and chip scale packaging have evolved to allow multiple integrated circuit devices to be interconnected in a group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One of the major issues regarding these technologies is the difficulty in soldering the components, while ensuring that reject conditions do not exist. Many of these devices rely on balls of solder attached to the underside of the integrated circuit device which is then reflown to connect with surface mount pads of the printed circuit board, flex circuit, or ceramic substrate. In some circumstances, these joints are generally not very reliable or easy to inspect for defects. The process to remove and repair a damaged or defective device is costly and many times results in unusable electronic components and damage to other components in the functional group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Many of the problems encountered with connecting integrated circuit devices to larger circuit assemblies are compounded in multi-chip modules. Multi-hip modules have had slow acceptance in the industry due to the lack of large scale known good die for integrated circuits that have been tested and burned-in at the silicon level. These dies are then mounted to a substrate, which interconnect several components. As the number of devices increases, the probability of failure increases dramatically. With the chance of one device failing in some way and effective means of repairing or replacing currently unavailable, yield rates have been low and the manufacturing costs high. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for achieving a fine pitch interconnect between a flexible circuit member and one or more circuit members with co-planar electrical contacts that have a large range of compliance. The connection with the circuit members can be soldered or solderless. The circuit member can be a printed circuit board, another flexible circuit, a baredie device, an integrated circuit device, an organic or inorganic substrate, a rigid circuit and virtually any other type of electrical component. The present invention is also directed to an electrical interconnect assembly comprising one or more flexible circuit members electrically coupled to a plurality of circuit members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the compliant interconnect assembly comprises a substrate and at least one flexible circuit member having a first surface with a plurality of first contact pads and a second surface. A compliant material is interposed between the substrate and the second surface of the flexible circuit member. The compliant material is aligned with one or more of the first contact pads to bias first contact pads away from the substrate when the first surface of the flexible circuit member is compressed against the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The substrate can be one of a printed circuit board, a flexible circuit, a bare die device, an integrated circuit device, a carrier, organic or inorganic substrates, a compliant material, or a rigid circuit. The compliant material can optionally be attached to the substrate or the flexible circuit member. In one embodiment, the compliant material comprises a first modulus of elasticity and the substrate comprises a compliant material having a second modulus of elasticity different from the first modulus of elasticity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A first circuit member having contact pads can be aligned with the first contact pads on the first surface of the flexible circuit member and compressively engaged with the compliant interconnect assembly so that the compliant material bias the first contact pads against corresponding contact pads on the first circuit member. One or more of the first contact pads on the flexible circuit member can be singulated contact pads. One or more locations of weakness can be formed in one or more of the first contact pads. In one embodiment, a second circuit member comprising a ball grid array is snap-fit with the first contact pads on the flexible circuit member. In another embodiment, the compliant material comprises a spring member. The flexible circuit member typically includes second contact pads located on the second surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, a portion of the flexible circuit member extends beyond the compliant interconnect assembly. A bare die device can be bonded to the portion of the flexible circuit member extending beyond the compliant interconnect assembly. Alternatively, a second compliant interconnect assembly can electrically couple that portion of the flexible circuit member with a second circuit member. In one embodiment, the flexible circuit member electrically couples with a second circuit member so that the first circuit member, the second circuit member and the substrate comprise a stacked configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The first contact pads can optionally have conductive structures adapted to electrically couple with contact pads on a first circuit member. The structures can have a shape complementary to a shape of the contact pads on the first circuit member. The contact pads on the flexible circuit member can be adapted to engage with a connector member selected from the group consisting of a flexible circuit, a ribbon connector, a cable, a printed circuit board, a ball grid array (BGA), a land grid array (LGA), a plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC), a pin grid array (PGA), a small outline integrated circuit (SOIC), a dual in-line package (DIP), a quad flat package (QFP), a leadless chip carrier (LCC), a chip scale package (CSP), or packaged or unpackaged integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the compliant interconnect assembly includes a substrate having first and second surfaces, and a plurality of holes. One or more regions of raised compliant material are located on the substrate. A first flexible circuit member having a first surface with a plurality of first contact pads and a second surface with a plurality of second contact pads is provided. The first surface of the substrate is located along a second surface of the first flexible circuit member with the raised compliant material aligned with the first contact pads and the holes in the substrate aligned with the second contact pads. A second flexible circuit member having a first surface with a plurality of first contact pads and a second surface with a plurality of second contact pads is optionally provided. The first surface of the second flexible circuit member is located along the second surface of the substrate so that the first contact pads of the second flexible circuit member are aligned with the holes in the substrate. The second contact pads on the first flexible circuit member and the first contact pads on the second flexible circuit members are preferably electrically coupled through the holes in the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to an electrical assembly comprising one or more circuit members compressively engaged with the compliant interconnect assembly so that the raised compliant material biases the contact pads on the flexible circuit member with corresponding contact pads on the circuit members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to an electrical assembly comprising a plurality of compliant raised portions located on a first circuit member. A flexible circuit member having a first surface with a plurality of contact pads and a second surface with a plurality of contact pads is provided. The contact pads on the first surface are bonded to contact pads on the first circuit member and the raised compliant material is aligned with the contact pads on the second surface of the flexible circuit member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to a method of making a compliant interconnect. In one embodiment, a substrate is prepared with a first array of through holes. A masking material is applied to the substrate. A second array of through holes is created through the masking material and substrate. A compliant material is applied to the second array of through holes. The masking material is removed to expose an array of compliant raised portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a masking material is applied to the substrate. An array of through holes is created through the masking material and substrate. A compliant material is applied to the an-ay of through holes. The masking material is removed to expose an array of compliant raised portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to a method of making a compliant interconnect assembly comprising the steps of aligning contact pads on a circuit member with the contact pads on the first surface of the flexible circuit member and compressing the circuit member with the compliant interconnect assembly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then flooded with one or more masling materials <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, such Es a solder mask or other materials. Through careful application and/or subsequent processing, such as polarization, the thickness of the masking material at locations <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is closely controlled for reasons that will become clearer below. The additional holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are then drilled or perforated in the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and masking material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a predetermined distance <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the existing through hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. While there is typically a hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> adjacent each of the holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, there is not necessarily a one-to-one correlation. The holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be arranged in a variety of configurations, which may or may not correlate to the one or two-dimensional array of holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are then filled with a compliant material <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The thickness of the compliant material <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is typically determined by the thickness of the masking material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Suitable compliant materials include elastomeric materials such as Sylgard&trade; available from Dow Corning Silicone of Midland, Mich. and MasterSyl &apos;713, available from Master Bond Silicone of Hackensack, N.J. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can optionally be subjected to a precision grinding operation, which results in very flat surfaces, typically within about 0.0005 inches. The grinding operation can be performed on both sides at the same time using a lapping or double grinding process. In an alternate embodiment, only one surface of the compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is subject to the planarization operation. The present method permits the accurate manufacture of raised portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having virtually any height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Once the compliant encapsulant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is cured, the masling material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is removed to yield the compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The compliant interconnection <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> includes the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, one or more raised portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the compliant encapsulant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extending above the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the through holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As used herein, &ldquo;compliant interconnect&rdquo; refers to a substate with one or more compliant raised portions extending above a surface of the substrate. The substrate can be a carrier or a circuit member, such as a printed circuit board, a flexible circuit, a bare die device, an integrated circuit device, organic or inorganic substrates, or a rigid circuit. The through holes are optionally added for some applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a compliant interconnect assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The compliant interconnect assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes the compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and one or more flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The first flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is located along one surface of the compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a polymeric sheet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a series of electrical traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> terminate at a contact pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The electrical trace <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> terminates in a solder ball <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The contact pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is positioned to engage with a contact pad <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on a first circuit member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The solder ball <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent to through hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. As used herein, &ldquo;circuit member&rdquo; refers to a printed circuit board, a flexible circuit, a packaged or unpackaged bare die silicon device, an integrated circuit device, organic or inorganic substrates, a rigid circuit, or a carrier (discussed below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The region of the polymeric sheet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> adjacent to the contact pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes singulation <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The singulation <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is a partial separation of the terminal from the sheet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that does not disrupt the electrical integrity of the conductive trace <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the singulation <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is a slit surrounding a portion of the contact pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The slit may be located adjacent to the perimeter of the contact pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or offset therefrom. The singulated flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> control the amount of force, the range of motion, and assist with creating a more evenly distributed force vs. deflection profile across the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a singulation can be a complete or partial separation or a perforation in the polymeric sheet Alternatively, singulation may include a thinning or location of weakness of the polymeric sheet along the edge of, or directly behind, the contact pad. The singulation releases or separates the contact pad from the polymeric sheet, while maintaining the interconnecting circuit traces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The singulations can be formed at the time of manufacture or the polymeric sheet can be subsequently patterned by stamping, cutting or a variety of other techniques. In one embodiment, a laser system, such as Excimer, CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or YAG, creates the singulation. This structure is advantageous in several ways, where the force of movement is greatly reduced since the flexible circuit member is no longer a continuous membrane, but a series of flaps or bond sites with a living hinge and bonded contact (see for example <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The second flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is likewise positioned on the opposite side of the compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Electrical trace <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to contact pad <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> positioned to engage with a contact pad <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> on a second circuit member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Solder ball <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is located on the opposite end of the electrical trace <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Polymeric sheet <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the second flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also includes a singulation <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> adjacent to the contact pad <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be part of the base laminate of the flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, respectively. Alternatively, discrete contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be formed separate from the flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and subsequently laminated or bonded in place. For example, an array of contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be formed on a separate sheet and laminate to the flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The laminated contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be subsequently processed to add structures (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) and/or singulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The contact pads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be a variety of structures such as, for example, a ball grid array, a land grid array, a pin grid array, contact points on a bare die device, etc. The contact pads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be electrically coupled with the compliant interconnect assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by compressing the components <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> together (solderless), by reflowing solder or solder paste at the electrical interface, by conductive adhesive at the electrical interface, or a combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the first and second flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are compressed against the compliant interconnect assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The solder balls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are reflown and create an electrical connection between the first and second flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, generally within through hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may optionally be used to retain the first and second flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are abutted against raised portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the compliant material <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The singulations <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> permit the raised portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to push the contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> above the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, without damaging the first and second flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, respectively. The raised portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also deforms outward due to being compressed. The contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may optionally be bonded to the raised compliant material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The raised compliant material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> supports the flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and provides a contact force that presses the contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> against the contact pads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> as the first and second circuit members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, respectively are compressed against the compliant interconnect assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The movement of the contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is controlled by the raised portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the compliant material <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the resiliency of the flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. These components are engineered to provide a desired level of compliance. The raised portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provide a relatively large range of compliance of the contact pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The nature of the flexible circuit members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> allow fine pitch interconnect and signal escape routing, but also inherently provides a mechanism for compliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an alternate substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with an array of through holes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, masking material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is applied to only one surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the through hole <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Additional holes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are prepared in the masking material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> a fixed distance <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> from the hole <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is only drilled partially into the substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A compliant material <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is then deposited in the hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. After the masking material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is removed, the resulting compliant interconnect <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes a raised compliant material only on one surface (see generally <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A suitable for use in the present invention. The flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A includes a series of electrical traces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A deposited on a polymeric sheet <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>A and terminating at an array of contact pads or terminals <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A. As used herein terminal refers to an electrical contact location or contact pad. In the illustrated embodiment, the terminals <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A include a singulation <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>A The degree of singulation <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>A can vary depending upon the application. For example, in some embodiments the flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A stretches in order to comply with the raised portions. In other embodiments a greater degree of singulation minimizes or eliminates stretching of the flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A due to engagement with the raised portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the terminals <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A include one or more locations of weakness <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A. As used herein, &ldquo;locations of weakness&rdquo; include cuts, slits, perforations or frangible portions, typically formed in the polymeric sheet <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>A and/or a portion of the electrical trace <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A forming the terminal <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A. The locations of weakness facilitate interengagement of an electrical contact, such as a ball contact on a BGA device, with the terminal <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>). The terminals <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A can optionally include an aperture <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>A to further facilitate engagement with an electrical contact. In another embodiment, a portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>A of the trace <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A protrudes into the aperture <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>A to enhance electrical engagement with the electrical contact </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, a compliant raise portion is attached to the rear of the flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A opposite the terminal <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). When the flexible circuit member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A is pressed against a surface (such as a printed circuit board), the raised compliant material lifts the singulated terminal <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A away from the surface. </paragraph>
