<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an air conditioner set back timer, to an air conditioning system formed by combining such a set back timer and an air conditioner, and to a set back timer display setting method. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a typical air conditioner its operating conditions (for example, air conditioning elements such as the amount of air delivery, the direction of wind, and the like) are set by a remote controller provided to an indoor unit, when cooling and heating modes of operation are provided by air conditioned wind delivered from the indoor unit. In addition to the remote controller, a set back timer is provided by which a time period in the day, during which period a normal air conditioning operation is carried out based on a given set temperature, is set (that is, &ldquo;setting when to start and stop the operation of the air conditioner in the day&rdquo;), and a time period in the normal air conditioning operation time, during which period a set back operation is carried out, is set (that is, &ldquo;setting when to perform a control operation for temperature shifting from the set temperature to a preprogrammed set back temperature according to a preselected time of the day so that the air conditioner operates based on the set back temperature). By virtue of execution of such a set back operation, energy saving modes of operation are realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Apart from the above, a set back timer is a timer through which a user performs program operations while confirming the contents of a setting. Accordingly, it is required that the contents of a setting and the change in setting be confirmed easily and correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, conventional set back timers have for example the following drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (a) A display of the contents of a setting in a time period in the day is vertically and dividedly displayed in two upper and lower sections. Accordingly, the user may find it difficult to confirm not only the connection of time periods but also a time period that has been set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (b) A display of a time period is displayed in three hours. Accordingly, time confirmation may be difficult because such a time displaying manner differs from a normal sense of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (c) It is arranged in conventional set back timers such that a time period display and a temperature display in a normal operation, and a time period display and a temperature display in a set back operation are selectively displayed using a single time period displaying area and a single temperature displaying area. In addition, it is arranged such that a user can tell the difference between normal operation time period and temperature displays and set back operation time period and temperature displays from such arrangement that each normal operation display is displayed in its &ldquo;lighting&rdquo; state when a normal operation is being carried out while when a set back operation is being carried out each set back operation display is displayed in its &ldquo;flashing&rdquo; state. Accordingly, the user may find it difficult to confirm the contents of a display, especially during the set back operation. Furthermore, it is impossible for the user to confirm both the contents of a normal operation display and the contents of a set back operation display at the same time, thereby causing the user operational inconveniences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (d) Although it is common that each day of the week is displayed by their first three letters, each day of the week is displayed by its initial letter in conventional set back timers. Accordingly, the user may find it difficult to confirm the days of the week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Bearing in mind the above described drawbacks with the conventional set back timers, the present invention was made. Accordingly, a major object of the present invention is to enhance the ease and certainty of confirming the contents of a setting by contriving the way of displaying the contents of a setting in an air conditioner set back timer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the set back timer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the present exemplary embodiment, the normal operation time period display <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> indicating a time period of the day during which period an air conditioning operation is carried out based on a given set temperature, and the set back time period display <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> indicating a time period of the day during which period a set back control operation is carried out are displayed independently of each other on the display screen <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This makes it possible to enable a user to easily confirm each of the normal and set back operation time periods. Additionally, these two operation time period displays <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are displayed vertically adjacently to each other, thereby enabling a user to contrast them by hour. This therefore allows the user to easily and correctly confirm, at a glance, the relationship between a normal operation time period and a time period of the day during which period a set back operation is carried out, in association with the times of the day. This remarkably improves the confirmability of the contents of a setting and the ease of confirming the contents of a setting in the display part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and improvements in the operability of the air conditioner A provided with the set back timer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Further, in the foregoing case, the normal operation time period display <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the set back time period display <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are displayed adjacently to each other in such a display manner that each display <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is displayed in the form of a single continuous bar chart, thereby allowing a user to contrast them by hour. For example, in comparison with a conventional case in which the time periods of the day are divided into two sections and each section is displayed in a bar chart-like display manner, thereby further facilitating grasping and confirming an operation time period of the day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the normal operation time period display <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the set back time period display <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided with the time indexes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for every two hours and with the time indexes <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> for every two hours, respectively. Such time indexes provided for every two hours are a typical way of displaying the hours of the day and facilitate grasping the ratio of a certain time period to the day. Accordingly, in comparison with conventional time indexes provided for every three hours, the contents of a setting can be confirmed more easily and correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the normal operation set temperature <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is displayed in the vicinity of the normal operation time period display <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, whereas the set back operation set temperature <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is displayed in the vicinity of the set back time period display <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. As a result of such arrangement, a user is allowed to easily confirm, at a glance, a normal operation time period versus its set temperature relationship as well as a set back operation time period versus its set temperature relationship. Each of the foregoing effects becomes more significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the set back timer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the present exemplary embodiment, the day display <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> indicating the presence or absence of an operation control setting for each day of the week and the clock display <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> indicating a present time are displayed in the display screen <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Such arrangement facilitates the contrasting between the presence or absence of an operation control setting for each day of the week and the contents of a set back control operation if performed (a time and a set temperature) and the contrasting between a current time and either a normal operation time period or a set back operation time period. For example, such arrangement facilitates judging how much time will be left until the time a set back control operation is started. Further, in this case, the day display <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> displays each day of the week by its first three letters. In comparison with a case in which each day of the week is displayed by its initial letter, the day display <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provides better visual confirmability of the days of the week, and the display screen <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provides further improved cofirmability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The air conditioner set back timer of the present invention has a display screen for the representation of information about normal and set back operations. In the display screen, a normal operation time period display indicating a time period of the day during which period a normal operation is carried out, and a set back time period display indicating a time period in the normal operation time period during which period a set back operation is carried out are displayed independently of each other. This enables a user to easily and correctly confirm, at a glance, a normal operation time period and a set back operation time period in the normal operation time period, thereby remarkably improving the confirmability of the contents of a setting and the ease of confirming the contents of a setting. Therefore, the present invention has high industrial applicability because it can provide especially remarkable effects contributable also to improvements in air conditioner operability. </paragraph>
