<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to housings or cabinets for pumps such as compressors or vacuum pumps. In particular, this invention concerns such a pump in which clam shell halves of the housing form seals at their abutting edges to define pressure or vacuum chambers or passageways within the housing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In many applications, a compressor or vacuum pump is housed inside a cabinet (a.k.a., housing), which may be molded plastic. In the case of a compressor, the compressor needs intake air, which must be drawn in from outside of the housing and directed to the intake port of the pump, the pump compresses it, and delivers it to a pressurized exhaust port. Typically, tubing is used to direct the output of the exhaust port to a port which is accessible by the user from outside of the housing. The intake air delivered to the pump usually must be filtered, so that only filtered air is delivered to the intake port, and tubing or passageways are required to communicate the filtered air to the intake port. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention provides an improvement to a pump having clam shell housing sections in which each said housing section has one or more walls which seal against one or more walls of the other housing section to define a sealed pressure or vacuum chamber within the walls when the housing sections are brought together. The walls come together to provide a seal all of the way around the chamber, which may be an inlet chamber, an outlet chamber, or a pressurized (including depressurized) passageway, so that a pressure difference can be contained in the chamber, either positive or negative. Thereby, additional tubing or passageways in addition to the housing for routing the intake and outlet of the pump are obviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form, the walls are overmolded with an elastomeric sealing material. The walls may seal against one another in end to end contact, or a wall may seal against the side surface of another wall. In the latter case, it is preferred that the sealing edge of the elastomeric sealing material be tapered to make a good seal, and the underlying edge of the wall may also be tapered to help reinforce the sealing material. Edge to side sealing is done with the exposed side of the sealing material facing the high pressure side, so that the pressure helps establish the seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The chamber may be in communication with either the intake or outlet port of the pump. At least one of the walls in each housing section may be formed with a half-circular recess in an edge of the wall so that the half circular recesses come together to seal around a circular intake or outlet port of the pump when the housing sections are brought together. A hole or tubular port may also be formed in one or more of the walls to create a means for entry of ambient air to the chamber, mainly for an intake chamber, or a port to which a tube could be connected, mainly for an outlet chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention will appear in the detailed description which follows. In the description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate one clam shell half <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a nebulizer housing and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the other clam shell half <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The nebulizer includes a motor pump unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which has an inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an exhaust port <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> opens into and draws air from an intake chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the exhaust port <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> opens into and expels pressurized air into an exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Air is drawn into the intake chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through a hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in one of the walls of the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a filter (not shown) may be installed in or over the hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Air is exhausted from the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through an outlet port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is formed in one of the walls of the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Part of each chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed by the clam shell half <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the other part of each chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed by the clam shell half <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Together, walls of the clam shell halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> create the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are sealed against the respective ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are sealed except at the respective ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The walls of the clam shell halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which make up the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are thin walled molded plastic sections which in each half are integrally molded with the other walls of the half The clam shell halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would typically be made of a relatively hard and stiff plastic material such as high impact polystyrene. The walls which make up the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would have a typical thickness of 0.090 inches. The edges of the walls that make up the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, where they abut all of the way around the respective chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, come together to seal the interiors of the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> against a pressure difference. However, for the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, along wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the edges do not abut, although a wall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the clam shell half <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> abuts the side surface of wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> So that the abutments of the walls of the clam shell half <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the walls of the clam shell half <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be sufficient so as to create a seal against a pressure difference between the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and atmospheric pressure, at each interface between the walls of the halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the interfacing surfaces are coated with a relatively soft, e.g. 50 to 60 durometer, thermoplastic elastomer or thermoplastic rubber (TPR) such as Santoprene. This is preferably overmolded onto the edges of the walls that create the seals for the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This can be done in a two-shot injection molding process, either in which the harder plastic which makes up the majority of the halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is first molded in one mold, and then the halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are put in separate molds to overmold the relatively softer elastomeric material, or in which the harder plastic is molded in one mold in one shot and then cores of the mold are retracted to make room for a shot of the relatively softer material over the edges of the walls that form the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in the case of the seal between the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a single TPR gasket <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is molded onto the edge of the wall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and has a tapered configuration so as to generally match the curvature of the surface of the wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and thereby create a seal between the wall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, to which the gasket <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached, and the wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which abuts the gasket <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. On the other side of the chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a gasket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is overmolded onto the edge of wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a gasket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is overmolded onto the edge of wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The gaskets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> abut each other to create a seal between them, and thereby create a seal between the walls <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A gasketed interface is provided all of the way around each chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the only inlet to chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the only outlet is port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the only inlet to chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is port <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the only outlet is port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In normal operation, chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is subjected to quite low pressure differences, being an intake chamber, with the only pressure difference being created by a filter which may be installed in hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be subjected to pressures on the order of about 15 psi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> illustrate how seals are created around the ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the motor pump unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Semi-circles are formed in the walls of the two halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which, when the edges of the semi-circular openings are overmolded with the relatively soft gasket material, closely mate with the outside diameters of the ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to cradle the ports. As an enhancement to the invention, rather than gaskets such as the gasket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> meeting along a flat surface, one of the gaskets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be formed with a pointed edge and the other gasket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be formed flat, or with a V-shaped groove to receive the pointed edge to create a form fit, to thereby create a more reliable seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> illustrate seals that are created for the intake chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The above description for the seals of the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> applies to the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as well, although with different walls and gasket edges meeting. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, mating overmolded gaskets are identified by reference numbers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, mating overmolded gaskets are identified by reference numbers <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> relatively tall wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has gasket material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at its end, which is tapered, and the gasket material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is also tapered to press up against the side of wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the half <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The tapering of the end of the wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> helps stiffen the gasket <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> against bending to improve the seal against the curved surface of the wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is created by pressing the gasket <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> against it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The two cabinet halves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are held together by any suitable means, such as snap fits, fasteners through holes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a combination of snap fits and fasteners, or any other suitable means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and variations to the preferred embodiment described will be apparent to those skilled in the art which will still embody the invention.
