<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a washing installation for printing press cylinders. A free-wheel drive (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) of a dirty-cloth roller (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) draws a section of a washing cloth from a clean-cloth roller (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) in each case via a pressing element (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) onto the dirty-cloth roller when a washing bar (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) that carries said components is returned from a washing position to a base position, and in the process a cloth transport lever (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) of the free-wheel drive catches on a first stop that is fastened to a holding device in which the washing bar (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is guided. When the washing bar is inserted into the guides of the holding device, a lever arm (<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) of the cloth transport lever (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) catches on a second stop that is provided on the holding device. This has the effect of moving the cloth transport lever (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) past the first stop (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) and simultaneously advancing the cloth from the clean-cloth roller (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) to the dirty-cloth roller (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a washing installation for printing press cylinders according to the preamble of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the invention relates to a washing installation for printing press cylinders, containing a washing bar which can be moved transversely with respect to the printing press cylinder, in guides of a holding device between a base position, which is at a predetermined distance from the printing press cylinder to be washed, and a washing position, which is close to the printing press cylinder; mountings for a clean-cloth roller and for a dirty roller for a washing cloth, a pressing element for pressing a washing-cloth section against the peripheral surface of the printing press cylinder on its path from the clean-cloth roller over the pressing element to the dirty-cloth roller, and a free-wheel drive for driving the dirty-cloth roller being arranged on the washing bar; a first stop on the holding device by means of which a cloth transport lever of the free-wheel drive is rotated in the drive direction by the first stop preventing the cloth transport lever following the movement of the washing bar when the washing bar is returned from the washing position into the base position, while the cloth transport lever of the free-wheel drive rotates automatically in the free-wheel direction when the washing bar is moved forward from the base position into the washing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,344,361 discloses washing bars which have a nozzle device for spraying water onto the washing cloth on its path from the clean-cloth roller to the pressing element. On the clean-cloth roller, the washing cloth is dry. Furthermore, it is known to store a washing cloth moistened with washing agent in a moist condition on the clean-cloth roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In known washing installations for printing press cylinders, the washing bar is inserted from above downward between the holding devices on both sides of a machine frame and then, in an arcuate insertion movement from the top rear to the bottom front, is set into the base position. This requires a relatively large amount of space for the insertion of the washing bar into the guides of the holding device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Before the washing bar is inserted into the guides of the holding device, a clean-cloth roll on a clean-cloth roller is inserted into the washing bar, and the start of the cloth is drawn over the pressing element to the dirty-cloth roller and fixed to the dirty-cloth roller. In the process, an attempt is made to tension the washing cloth as well as possible between the clean-cloth roller and the dirty-cloth roller, in order that the washing cloth is tensioned tautly over the pressing element during the subsequent washing operation. This tensioning of the washing cloth is frequently not performed carefully enough. In the event of a sagging washing cloth, there is the risk that it will be carried along by the printing press cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The cylinder to be cleaned in printing presses is in particular a blanket cylinder which, in the offset printing process, transfers the printing image from a plate cylinder to the printing medium or a paper web or a paper sheet. However, other cylinders of printing units in a printing press can also be washed with the washing bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention is intended to achieve the object of constructing the washing installation for printing press cylinders in such a way that less space is needed to insert the washing bar into the guides of the holding devices, the intention being at the same time to ensure that when the washing bar is inserted into the holding devices, a clean washing-cloth section automatically lies over the pressing element and the washing cloth is tensioned optimally between the clean-cloth roller and the dirty-cloth roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this object is achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a washing installation for printing press cylinders is characterized in that the guides formed in the holding devices extend rearward in the direction of the washing position over the base position, and in that the washing bar can be moved from back to front in the guides, from an inserted position into the base position in the same direction of motion in which it can be moved forward from the base position to the washing position; in that a second lever arm is rotationally fixedly connected to the cloth transport lever for common rotational movements, at least in the drive direction of the free-wheel, in that the cloth transport lever and the second lever arm project away from each other in opposite directions, transversely with respect to the direction of the movements of the washing bar between its base position and its washing position, in that the first stop is arranged on the side of the dirty-cloth roller, on which the cloth transport lever projects, in that a second stop is arranged on the holding device on that side of the dirty-cloth roller that faces away from the one side on which the second lever arm projects; in that the second stop is arranged to be offset rearward with respect to the first stop to such an extent that the second lever arm rests on the second stop and, as a result, rotates the cloth transport lever in the drive direction to such an extent that the latter is moved past the first stop without catching when the washing bar is moved from the inserted position into the base position, the second stop forcing the second lever arm away and releasing it at the latest when the washing bar reaches the base position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention has the following advantages in particular: The washing bar can be inserted from the rear into the guides of the holding devices on both sides and can be moved rectilinearly in the same direction from the insertion position into the base position, in which direction the washing bar can also be moved from the base position into a washing position and back again. Therefore, less operating space is needed for the insertion of the washing bar into the holding devices. The washing cloth is automatically tensioned as the washing bar is inserted into the holding devices, even if it could not be tensioned sufficiently tightly during manual insertion into the washing bar. When the washing bar is taken out of the holding devices after a plurality of washing operations, then, as a result of the preceding washing operation, a washing-cloth section made dirty by the cleaned cylinder is located on the pressing element. When the washing bar is inserted into the holding devices again, the washing cloth is automatically advanced, in the aforementioned way, by the lever arm catching on the second stop, so that automatically a fresh washing-cloth section comes to lie over the pressing element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further features of the invention are contained in the subclaims.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The washing installation according to the invention for washing a cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, contains a washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which can be moved forward and backward in preferably rectilinear guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> belonging to two stationary guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> arranged parallel at a distance from each other, between the base position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which is at a predetermined distance from the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be washed, and the washing position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which is close to the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, at right angles to this cylinder, by a drive which is not shown but is controlled by a printing press control system, for example a hydraulic cylinder or pneumatic cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has two side plates <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> arranged parallel at a distance from each other for mounting a clean-cloth roller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for a washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Also provided is a pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for pressing a washing-cloth section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> onto the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the path of the washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the clean-cloth roller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. On the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> there is a free-wheel drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for driving the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example in the clockwise direction in accordance with arrows <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, in order to transport the washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> step by step from the clean-cloth roller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over the pressing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> onto the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such a transport step being executed each time the washing bar is moved back from the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> into the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On one of the two stationary guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which lies opposite the free-wheel drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a first stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed, by means of which a cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the free-wheel drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, together with the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is rotated in the drive direction, that is to say in the clockwise direction according to the arrows <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the case of the embodiment illustrated, by the first stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> preventing the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> following the movement of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> when the washing bar is moved back from the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> into the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by the drive (not shown) under control of the control device, likewise not shown. These are not shown because they are generally known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> However, when the washing bar is moved forward from the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> into the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is automatically rotated in the free-wheel direction, that is to say in the counterclockwise direction counter to the arrows <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the case of the embodiment illustrated. In this case, only the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> rotates but, because of the free-wheel action of the free-wheel drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, not the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This back rotation of the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the free-wheel direction is preferably effected by a spring integrated in the free-wheel drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. According to another embodiment, however, a further stop could be provided on the stationary guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated, it will be assumed that, in the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> presses the washing-cloth section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located on it onto the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to clean the latter while the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rotates and the washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is stationary. According to another embodiment, however, the washing-cloth section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> could still be at a small distance from the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the cylinder and could be pressed onto the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of an additional movement of the pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> relative to the side plates <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Such embodiments are known from the prior art and have an inflatable rubber lip, for example, as the pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each of the two side plates <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> bears, with a longitudinal spacing, two roller pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (rollers mounted on pins) which are arranged one behind the other and project laterally outward and which, on both sides of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, each engage in one of the guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the stationary guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. At their rear end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are open. As a result, the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be inserted from the rear with its roller pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> into the rear slot ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in the slot longitudinal direction, and as a result can be brought into the insertion position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. At their front end, facing the cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be open or closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the stationary guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are drawn one above another in side view, in order better to be able to see the movement sequences of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and its parts. The lateral arrangement of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> between the stationary guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extend rearward in the guide plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the direction of the front washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> until they are beyond the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, so that the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from the rear toward the front in their open, rear slot end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the same direction of movement as it can be moved forward from the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> into the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and can be introduced into the guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in which both the front and the rear roller pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are in the guide slots <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and hold the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that it cannot tilt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A second lever arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is rotationally fixedly connected to the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for common rotational movements, at least in the drive direction <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second lever arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be two parts or can preferably together consist of a single-piece material part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the second lever arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> project away from each other in opposite directions, transversely to the direction of the movements of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> between its base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and its washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> projecting upward and the second lever arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> projecting downward in the embodiment illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The first stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is arranged on the side (upper side) of the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on which the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> projects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A second stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located on the guide plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is adjacent to the free-wheel drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, on that side (lower side) of the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which faces away from the one side (upper side) on which the second lever arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> projects. Both stops <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are arranged on the same guide plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and both project forward and inward from the latter in the direction of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment, the dimensions are chosen in such a way that the second lever arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and therefore also the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are rotated through a rotational angle in the drive direction <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while, during the inward movement of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the insertion position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> into the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it remains caught on the second stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to a predetermined transport distance of the washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around the pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, by which transport distance the washing cloth is transported by the cloth transport lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> when the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is moved back from the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> into the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, even with an extremely small diameter of the dirty-cloth coil on the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In order that this is not the case, but an equally large washing cloth distance of the washing cloth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is transported onward around the pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during each return stroke of the washing bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the washing position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> into the base position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, known measures are provided, which are therefore not described in detail here, in order to produce constant advance distances of the washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a changing coil diameter of the washing cloth on the dirty-cloth roller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can already be pre-moistened on the clean-cloth roller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as in the prior art, or spray nozzles or other liquid feed means can be provided in order to moisten the washing cloth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on its movement path from the clean-cloth roller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the pressing element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as is known from the prior art. </paragraph>
