<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to actuator positioning systems, and more particularly to an electro-hydraulic system for precisely positioning the output of a hydraulic actuator. In presently preferred embodiments of the invention, the invention relates yet more specifically to electro-hydraulic vehicle power steering systems that incorporate an electric/hydrostatic steering assist module. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Typical power assisted steering systems in use today include a belt-driven high rpm rotary hydraulic pump, specifically engineered hoses, tubes, couplings, an array of brackets and fasteners, and a rack and pinion subassembly. All of these components are engineered to endure the rigors of extreme thermal cycling brought about by a combination of ambient temperatures in the engine compartment, and various operational loads handled by the steering pump under the usual driving conditions. Such power-assisted systems are a source of noise, operating inefficiency and leakage, and consume a large amount of engine power. Power assisted steering pumps are built to very exact tolerances. Many components of these pumps are fabricated under tightly controlled manufacturing processes in order to maintain design specifications. Small discrepancies in manufacturing processes can lead to many performance problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A general object of the present invention is to provide an electro-hydraulic system for positioning a hydraulic actuator that obtains improved accuracy at reduced cost. Another object of the present invention is to limit, if not entirely eliminate, many of the problems described above associated with conventional electro-hydraulic actuator positioning systems, including specifically power steering systems. Another object is to provide a power steering system which is composed of a relatively few parts, is rugged and durable in use, and is capable of being inexpensively manufactured and readily installed. A further object of the invention is to provide an electro-hydraulic steering assist module for automotive applications that eliminates any requirement for a conventional rotary-driven power steering fluid pump, which in turn eliminates a major source of fluid-borne noise and increases fuel economy. Another object of the invention is to provide a power steering assist module that employs a rack and pinion assembly that is currently in production, thereby eliminating any necessity for redesigning or requalifying the rack and pinion portion of the steering system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An electro-hydraulic actuator system in accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the invention includes a hydraulic actuator having a pair of fluid chambers and being operable to provide an actuator output as a function of fluid pressures at the chambers. An electric-hydrostatic actuator includes an electric motor responsive to motor control signals for providing an output to a motor shaft, one or more pistons coupled to the shaft, and one or more hydraulic cylinders mounted on the motor and cooperating with the pistons for providing a pair of fluid cylinders respectively coupled to the fluid chambers at the hydraulic actuator. A solenoid valve is connected between the chambers, and is responsive to valve control signals for feeding fluid between the actuator chambers and thereby short circuiting the hydrostatic actuator cylinders. A pair of pressure sensors are coupled to the actuator chambers for providing respective pressure signals as a function of fluid pressure at the chambers, and a controller is responsive to the pressure signals for providing the valve and motor control signals. The electro-hydraulic actuator system of the present invention is disclosed in conjunction with electro-hydraulic steering assist modules for automotive steering applications. However, the electro-hydraulic actuator system of the present invention may also be employed in conjunction with marine applications such as rudder and engine tilt controls, aerospace applications such as landing gear, cargo door and flight control surface controls, and industrial applications such as assembly line diverters and horizontal fork positioning controls on fork trucks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The electric motor in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention comprises a rotary motor, and the motor output shaft comprises a leadscrew operatively coupled to the piston or pistons for moving the piston or pistons linearly in associated cylinders. In one disclosed embodiment of the invention, the leadscrew is a rotary leadscrew disposed in axially stationary position, and the piston or pistons are axially movable along the rotary leadscrew. In another disclosed embodiment of the invention, the leadscrew is non-rotatable and has external threads coupled to internal threads on a rotatable armature sleeve disposed within the motor, and a piston is mounted on one or both ends of the leadscrew. Rotation of the armature sleeve translates the leadscrew axially with respect to the motor and reciprocates the piston(s) within the associated cylinder(s). In one embodiment of the invention, a single piston is disposed within the cylinder of a housing mounted to the motor, and the fluid cylinders are formed on opposite sides of the piston. In another embodiment of the invention, housings are secured to the axial ends of the motor, and the leadscrew extends from the axial ends of the motor for coupling to pistons within the associated housings. The housing or housings preferably are formed by an extrusion that has a central chamber within which a piston is disposed, and at least one peripheral chamber that cooperates with passages in end caps for forming fluid passages to and from the fluid cylinders. The control electronics may be mounted in another peripheral chamber, and may include a magnetic sensor for monitoring position of the piston within its associated chamber through the extrusion wall that divides the chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the disclosed embodiments of the invention having particular utility in electro-hydraulic power steering assist applications, an elongated rack is adapted to be connected at opposite ends to steerable wheels on a vehicle. A rotatable steering gear is in mesh with a series of teeth along a section of the rack, and is adapted to be operatively connected to a steering wheel of a vehicle so as to receive vehicle operator steering input. The rack extends lengthwise within an elongated housing constructed to form a power assist cylinder. A piston is carried by the rack and separates the power assist cylinder into first and second power assist working fluid chambers that are respectively coupled to the fluid cylinders of the electric-hydrostatic actuator. The power assist steering system preferably is entirely self contained, requiring no fluid input from an external rotary pump or the like. The power steering rack and pinion arrangement may be of conventional design, eliminating any requirement for redesigning or requalifying this portion of the steering system. Control parameters such as steering &ldquo;feel&rdquo; may be readily configured by software in the control electronics.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now more particularly to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows, in an exemplary first system embodiment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention, an elongated rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adapted to be connected at opposite ends to the steerable wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a motor vehicle. The rack has a series of teeth <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> along a section of its length. A rotatable pinion gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in mesh with the rack teeth <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to a steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the vehicle by a column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to receive operator steering input. (In many applications, there is an intermediate steering column or shaft connected to pinion gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by universal joints. This intermediate shaft is not illustrated in the schematic diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and is not germane to the illustrated embodiments of the present invention.) Rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends lengthwise within an elongated housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is constructed to form an elongated power assist linear actuator cylinder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> adjacent to one end. Spaced apart circular interior portions of reduced diameter define the ends of the cylinder and have a sealed engagement with the rack in order to close opposite ends of the cylinder. A piston <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> carried by the rack within cylinder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has a sealed engagement with the interior of the cylinder and separates the cylinder into cylinder chambers <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the piston. Hydraulic fluid fills the chambers. A fluid line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> communicates with one chamber <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> adjacent to one end of the actuator cylinder. A fluid line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicates with the other chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adjacent to the opposite end of the cylinder. Fluid lines <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected to corresponding ports of a power assist module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. A normally open solenoid valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected between fluid lines <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for operation as will be described. In the absence of an electrical valve control signal, caused for example by an electrical control unit or power failure, valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> will open so as to short circuit module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and provide full manual (non-assisted) steering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> illustrate power assist module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in greater detail. Module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes an electric motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> having a stator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with associated stator windings, and a rotor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> having associated radially extending poles. Motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be of any suitable type, including a switched reluctance motor, a brushless dc motor, a brushed dc motor and an ac motor. A switched reluctance motor is currently preferred. Rotor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is secured to a leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a coupling <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> or other suitable means such that rotor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotate coaxially and in unison. The leadscrew is preferably press fitted and epoxied to the rotor. The rotor and leadscrew can alternatively be made as a single unit. Rotor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is supported at opposite axial ends by bearings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> carried by respective motor end bells <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Bearing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is mounted within a keeper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. A resolver <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or other suitable rotary position sensor is coupled to the end of rotor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> within end bell <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (or end bell <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) for providing to control electronics a signal indicative of rotary position of the rotor and leadscrew shaft. Sensorless commutation may also be employed utilizing the stator windings as a position sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is mounted on end bell <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> preferably is in the form of an elongated extrusion, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, having a central chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that is coaxial in assembly with and surrounds leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of peripheral chambers surrounding the central chamber. Being an extrusion, the central chamber and peripheral chambers are of uniform geometry throughout the length of the extruded housing body. A piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is slidably disposed within chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and has internal threads operatively coupled to the external threads of leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, axial position of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with respect to leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is controlled by rotation of the leadscrew, which in turn is controlled by rotation of rotor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> within stator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are non-circular, preferably elliptical in lateral cross section so that piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> does not rotate within chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> during rotation of leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and axial translation of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> lengthwise of chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is mounted on the end of extrusion housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> remote from end bell <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a fluid port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> connected by a cross passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to a central internal pocket <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, which aligns in assembly with central chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The end of chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the opposing side of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> communicates with a central pocket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in end bell <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Pocket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is connected by a cross passage <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to a pocket <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is aligned in assembly with a peripheral extrusion passage <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The opposing end of passage <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> aligns with a pocket <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a fluid port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Thus, port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the working chamber formed on one side of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by means of cross passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, pocket <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the working chamber on the opposing side of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by means of pocket <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, pocket <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, cross passage <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and pocket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In assembly of module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with steering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), fluid lines <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected to ports <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A pair of pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are secured on port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in fluid communication with the opposing sides of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. These pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> provided electrical pressure signals as a function of fluid pressure within fluid lines <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Fluid pressure in these lines varies not only as a function of position of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> within extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, but also as a function of position of rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under control of steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A pair of gaskets <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are mounted between port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and end bell <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the opposing ends of extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A shaft seal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is mounted on the end of leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> within port cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and a second shaft seal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> surrounds armature <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> within end bell <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. An electronic controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is disposed within a peripheral chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A pair of openings <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in one outside wall of extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provide for electrical connection to electronic controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> from outside module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. An opening <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> in end bell <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provides for electrical connection to the windings of motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> carries a magnetic <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> adjacent to the wall <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> of chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that separates chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Electronic controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes a magnetic position sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> disposed in assembly adjacent to wall <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> carries Hall effect or other sensor elements responsive to magnetic energy from magnet <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> on piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for sensing the axial position of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> along chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of extrusion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Inasmuch as piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is non-rotatably mounted within chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, magnetic <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is continuously positioned adjacent to sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The mating threads of leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are engineered and fabricated to provide smooth low friction operation with minimal leakage between the opposed fluid chambers. However, a small controlled leakage of fluid between the leadscrew and the piston may be desirable because the fluid would act as a lubricant between the leadscrew and the piston. A boundary layer of fluid would also aid in limiting backlash typically associated with threaded components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A steering wheel position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to steering wheel column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for providing an electrical signal indicative of absolute position of the steering wheel. This steering wheel position sensor may be monitored to provide the following steering wheel information: (a) the angular displacement in degrees (left or right) from a center position, which is defined as the point where the steerable wheels are straight ahead; (b) the rate at which the steering wheel is being turned (measured in degrees per second, for example). The steering wheel position information from sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be analyzed by controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and used for: (a) initialization and positioning of piston <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the steering assist module at the time of vehicle start-up. (b) all steering maneuvers. The steering wheel position information may be used to calculate the required rpm of electric motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for steering assist operations. Steering wheel position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be of any suitable type, such as an optical disk and associated sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A torque sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is also coupled to steering column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. During vehicle operation, a measurable amount of torque is applied to steering column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, either by the vehicle operator through steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or in reaction to road forces reflected back through the steering gear of the vehicle into the system. This torque value reflected in steering column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is affected by a number of factors including: (a) the coefficient of friction between the vehicle tires and the driving or road surface. This coefficient of friction in turn is affected by: (1) vehicle weight, (2) vehicle speed, and (3) driving surface conditions (e.g., dry pavement, surface temperature, gravel, sand, water, ice); (b) friction between components of the mechanical steering system: (1) articulating joints (e.g., steering column universals, bearings, tie-rod ends, balljoint); (2) mating gear surfaces; (3) lubrication and contamination seals; (c) continued application of force to steering wheel after: (1) design travel limits of steering system have been met (i.e., full turn left or right); (2) contact with an external obstruction (e.g., a curb or a rut in the driving surface); (d) continued application of steering force to offset external forces: (1) constant radius turns (e.g., ramp onto freeway); (2) driving surfaces that pitched perpendicular to direction of travel (e.g., a crowned road). Data obtained from torque sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be used in conjunction with data taken from pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and integrated to determine and control the magnitude of the torque output of motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to be applied to develop the hydraulic fluid pressure to assist vehicle steering operations. This data can also be used to differentiate between operator input and road induced phenomena through suitable software systems in controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram of electronic controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes a microprocessor-based motor control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> receives an input from piston position sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through an associated interface circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, an input from steering column position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through an associated interface circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, an input from steering column torque sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through an associated signal conditioning circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and signals from pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> through associated signal conditioning circuits <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. A motor control circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through a communication interface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and is connected to motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through an inverter circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Motor control circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> receives position feedback information from resolver <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a resolver signal conditioning circuit <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for closed loop servo control of motor rotation. Motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> also provides input to motor control unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> indicative of motor winding temperature through an associated interface circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Motor control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is connected to a reset and watchdog timer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for monitoring continued operation of the motor control unit, and is connected to other control units on the vehicle through an interface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Motor control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can obtain information indicative of vehicle on/off status and vehicle speed through interface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides a valve control signal output to solenoid valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) through a solenoid valve driver <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is powered by the dc power system of the vehicle through suitable voltage regulation. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is directly coupled to steering column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so steering column position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provides an indication of rack position. In other applications, a position sensor may be coupled to rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for providing a direct indication of absolute rack position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In operation, the vehicle operator provides a steering input to rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) by means of steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, steering column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and pinion gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Motion of the rack, and consequent motion of piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within cylinder <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, creates a pressure differential at lines <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is sensed by pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Electronic controller <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> receives these pressure signals, and provides a control signal to motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> so as to command rotation of leadscrew <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and motion of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> within chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to minimize this pressure differential between the two sensors. This electromotively developed motion of piston <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the consequent hydraulically-developed fluid flow forces, provide the power to assist the vehicle operator in manually applying torque through steering column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired motion at rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and move steerable wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When the vehicle is operated at relatively low speed, it is important that the power steering assist system be effective. Normally open solenoid valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is closed by a valve control signal from control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and assist module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is fully effective. However, at higher speeds, power assist is normally not needed. Under such circumstances, a vehicle speed sensor will provide appropriate input to motor control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through vehicle bus interface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, whereupon control unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will de-energize solenoid valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, opening the valve and disabling the power assistance. In an emergency situation, such as when the operator of the vehicle makes a sudden lane change, a first indication of the steering maneuver is provided by steering column torque sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. There is also a momentary increase in fluid pressure will be sensed by pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, sending a signal to the controller to energize solenoid valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to close the valve and allow power assistance. It is to be noted that use of a normally-open solenoid valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> allows the rack and pinion steering arrangement to be effective, without power assistance, in the event of electrical power failure at the vehicle or failure at the power assistance electrical control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrate a second embodiment <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Reference numerals that are identical to those used in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> indicate identical or functionally related parts. A power assist module <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> includes an electric motor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> having a stator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and a rotatable armature <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. A sleeve <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) is press fitted or otherwise secured within armature <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> so as to rotate conjointly with the armature within stator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Sleeve <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> has internal threads mated with external threads on a leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extends from both axial ends of motor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Armature <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted between a pair of end bells <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> by means of bearings <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> rotatably supporting axially opposed ends of sleeve <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. A resolver or other suitable rotary position sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is mounted within a cap <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> secured to end bell <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and operatively coupled to sleeve <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> for detecting rotary position of the sleeve. A pair of end housings <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are mounted on end bells <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> respectively externally coaxially surrounding the opposed ends of leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Housing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has an internal chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, within which is disposed a piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> operatively coupled to the associated end of leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Likewise, housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> has an internal chamber <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, within which is disposed a piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> operatively coupled to the associated opposite end of leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Thus, rotation at armature <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> results in axial translation of leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and pistons <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> within their associated chambers <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The subassembly of pistons <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is prevented from rotating with sleeve <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> by means of a pin <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>) extending through an anti rotation collar <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> secured to end bell <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. and an elongated slot <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) in leadscrew <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The axially outer end of housing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> terminates in a port cap <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> having a fluid passage <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for connection to fluid line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) through a fitting <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Likewise, housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> has a port cap <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> with a fluid passage <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> for connection to the other fluid line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) through a fitting <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>. Fluid pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are also mounted on the port caps and connected to fluid passages <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> respectively. Piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has a magnet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> at its periphery adjacent to the internal wall of chamber <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. A magnetic position sensor, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, is externally mounted on housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for tracking position of piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> within chamber <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> includes a magnet <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> disposed within a non-magnetic keeper <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Keeper <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is slidably longitudinally captured between a pair of sensor strips <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Keeper <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> has a pair of laterally extending wipers <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that slidably engage strips <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> respectively. Strips <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> comprise variable resistance strips that provide electrical output signals indicative of position of keeper <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and magnet <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> between the strips. Strips <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> are captured within a U-shaped housing <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. and a cover <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is positioned over housing <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> to form sensor assembly <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. Cover <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is secured to port cap <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and end bell cap <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> carries a magnet <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. and a piston position sensor <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> identical to sensor <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is mounted to housing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>). Sensors <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are connected to motor control electronics <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and system control electronics <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), as are motor stator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and solenoid valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In operation, the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> functions in a manner similar to that of the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Operator steering input to rack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces a pressure differential between pressure sensors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. This pressure differential is sensed by the control electronics, which provide input to motor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for moving pistons <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> conjointly in a direction to reduce such pressure differential. This piston movement assists the operator steering input to the steering system, as in the prior embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also illustrates that the electro-hydraulic actuator system in accordance with the present invention may receive external control input not only from a steering wheel or yoke <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> associated with a vehicle steering system, but also from a joystick <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a geographic positioning system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and/or a voice input command module <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As indicated previously, the electronic control unit may be connected through vehicle bus interface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to as conventional multiplexed vehicle information network. On/off vehicle input information and vehicle speed information may be obtained from the vehicle information network. There may be a bidirectional exchange of system data over the vehicle network, so that the system control electronics may share with a conventional vehicle onboard electronic control unit the power steering system status, pressure data, actuator sensor data, etc. System performance can then be monitored by suitable software, system diagnostics can be analyzed by suitable software, and system performance can be enhanced by changes in such software. Both illustrated embodiments of the invention show use in a power-assisted vehicle steering system, in which the hydraulic actuator is double-ended and integrated with an otherwise conventional rack and pinion steering arrangement for connection to opposed steerable vehicle wheels. However, the hydraulic actuator could be single-ended or a rotary-type actuator without departing from the principles of the invention in their broadest aspects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> There has thus been disclosed an electro-hydraulic actuator system that fully satisfies all of the objects and aims previously set forth. The invention has been disclosed in conjunction with electro-hydraulic power-assisted vehicle steering systems, but finds ready application in other system applications as described. As applied specifically to power steering systems, elimination of the conventional rotary pump removes a major source of fluid-borne noise and improves fuel economy on the order of four to seven percent. A number of modifications and variations have been discussed. Other modifications and variations will readily suggest themselves to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the foregoing description. The invention is intended to embrace all such modifications and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
