<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns a product comprising at least an inhibitor of heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction, associated with at least another anti-hypertensive agent, in particular calcium channel blockers and conversion enzyme inhibitors, for simultaneous, separate or prolonged therapeutic use, in the treatment of hypertension. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a product comprising at least one G protein inhibitor, and preferably a compound of general formula (I) defined below, combined with at least one anti-hypertensive agent, preferably chosen from the group comprising calcium channel antagonists or conversion enzyme inhibitors, for simultaneous, separate or spread over time therapeutic use, in the treatment of arterial hypertension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Arterial hypertension is a very common disease and one to which a high morbidity and mortality rate is associated. According to age, treatment of hypertension must be considered when the systolic arterial pressure is higher than 160-180 mm of mercury and the diastolic pressure higher than 100-110 mm of mercury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The optimum strategy for the care of patients suffereing from hypertension is still under discussion. Non-pharmacological treatment (reduction of sodium intake in food, loss of weight, physical exercise, giving up tobacco products etc.) is a possibility in patients with moderate hypertension. Pharmacological treatment begins with monotherapy, which allows satisfactory blood pressure control in 50-60% of patients. Changing therapeutic class as well as combination with another class of anti-hypertensive agents represent the alternative treatments in the event of resistance to the first therapy (Beaufils and Element, <highlight><italic>Drugs, </italic></highlight>56, 11-21, (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Anti-hypertensive medicaments can be divided into several classes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> thiazidic and similar diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, cicletanine, xipamide, indapamide and clopamide; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> loop diuretics such as furosemide, piretanide and bumetanide; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> hyperkalaemia causing (potassium-sparing) diuretics such as amiloride, spironolactone and canrenone; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> beta-blockers such as propranolol, acebutolol, atenolol, nadolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, pindolol, oxprenolol and betaxolol; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> conversion enzyme inhibitors (CEI) such as captopril, enalapril, benazepril, lisinopril, quinapril, ramipril and imidapril; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs), such as losartan, candesartan, cilexetil, irbesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Slow calcium channel antagonists, such as nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, diltiazem, bepridil, lacidipine, nitrendipine, nicardipine and verapamil; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> central anti-hypertensive agents such as clonidine, guanfacine, monoxidine, rilmenidine and &agr;-methyl-dopa; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> alpha-blockers such as prasozine, urapidil, doxazosine and terazosine; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> vasodilators such as hydralazine, dihydralazine and minoxidil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the development of new anti-hypertensive treatments of course involves the discovery of new molecules (cf. Singh et al, <highlight><italic>Drugs, </italic></highlight>58(4):579-87 (October 1999); (Mancia et al, <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Cardiol., </italic></highlight>14(5):375-80 (September 1999); Cases, <highlight><italic>Drug new Perspect., </italic></highlight>12(6) 372-377 (1999)). Among the new families of molecules intended for the treatment of hypertension, the following can in particular be mentioned: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> vasopeptidase inhibitors; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> endothelin antagonists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> More recently, allellic variations of the genes coding for the angiotensinogen, the &bgr;2-adrenergic receptor, and the &bgr;3 sub-unit of the G protein have been identified. (Luft, F. C., <highlight><italic>Journal of hypertension, </italic></highlight>16, 1871-1878, (1998)). In addition, the results of Anand-Srivastava (<highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biochem., </italic></highlight>175, 163-170, (1996)) suggest that the increase in the expression of the Gi &agr;-2 and Gi &agr;-3 proteins in the heart and the aorta which precedes the development of an increase in arterial pressure in the SHR rat (Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat) can be one of the factors causing hypertension. Similarly, the &bgr;&ggr; sub-units of the G protein seem to be involved in the control of the recurrence of stenosis and the proliferation of smooth vascular muscle cells (Iaccarino et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96, 3945-3950,(1999)). Blocking of these sub-units by a &bgr;ARKct peptide prevents proliferation. On the other hand, a Gi protein inhibitor, pertussic toxin, is capable of lowering the arterial pressure of the SHR rat by intravenous injection. This lowering of pressure is observed for two weeks and seems more marked in the hypertensive rat than in the normotensive rat (Kost et coll, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology, 26, 449-455, (1999)). Similarly the renal vascular tonus in the SHR rat is modified by pertussic toxin with an increase in renal vascular flux and a reduction in renal vascular resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Together, these recent works suggest that heterotrimeric G protein can represent a therapeutic target for the control of hypertension by the development of products specifically targeting this transduction signal. The G protein participates in the transmission of signals from outside the cell towards the interior thanks to its interaction with the receptors with seven transmemnbrane fields using different effectors including adenylate cyclase, C phospholipase or also ionic canals (cf. Gilman, A. G., <highlight><italic>Biosci. Rep., </italic></highlight>15, 65-97 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has furthermore described specific inhibitors of signal transduction by heterotrimeric G proteins in the PCT patent application WO 00/02558 (which describes the use of the compounds of General Formula (I) hereafter, already known as farnesyltransferase inhibitors (cf. WO 97/30053), as inhibitors of the transduction of heterotrimeric G protein signals) and WO 00/02881. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the limit of the efficacy of monotherapy is reached, the discovery of effective combinations of different therapeutic classes is sought to combine the effect of each class and better combat hypertension of multifactorial origin. For example, a combination using beta-blockers and calcic antagonists is effective in 80 to 85% of cases. This combination allows doses to be reduced in comparison to the doses used in monotherapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The Applicant shows in the present Application that the combination of a G protein inhibitor with another anti-hypertensive agent, preferably an anti-hypertensive agent from another class, allows hypertension to be reduced more effectively. A product according to the invention offers the advantage of allowing lower doses of the anti-hypertensive agents chosen to be used, which has the main effect of reducing the side effects of the treatment whilst obtaining an equivalent therapeutic benefit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A subject of the invention is therefore a product comprising at least one inhibitor of the transduction of heterotrimeric G protein signals combined with at least one anti-hypertensive agent, preferably an anti-hypertensive agent from another class, said anti-hypertensive agent being preferably chosen from the group comprising calcium channel inhibitors and conversion enzyme inhibitors for simultaneous, separate or spread over time therapeutic use, in the treatment of arterial hypertension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a product according to the invention will comprise a heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction inhibitor corresponding to general formula (I)

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In order to illustrate the usefulness of the invention, the effect on the arterial pressure of spontaneously hypertensive type rats of treatment with 7-(2-amino-1-oxo-3-thiopropyl)-8-(cyclohexylmethyl)-2-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo&lsqb;1,2a&rsqb;pyrazine (hereafter designated compound 2, described in Application WO 00/02881), combined with anti-hypertensive agents of two different classes, namely conversion enzyme inhibitors (captopril) and calcium channel inhibitors (verapamil) will be studied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> 1) Procedures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> 13/14 week old male SHR rats (Charles River France) are anaesthetized using pentobarbital (Sanofi) (60 mg/kg/IP). A carotid artery is catheterised for measuring arterial pressure and heart rate (Gould pressure and physiography sensors, Buxco acquisition software version 1.5.7 and Analyst analysis software version 1.35 (EMKA)). A jugular vein is catheterised for the injection of the anti-hypertensive agent, compound 2 is injected into the vein of the penis. After a stabilization period of 10 minutes, the product or two products simultaneously are administered and their effects are monitored for 20 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> For administration purposes, 7-(2-amino-1-oxo-3-thiopropyl)-8-(cyclohexylmethyl)-2-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-imidazo&lsqb;1,2a&rsqb;pyrazine, verapamil (Sigma, USA) and captopril (Sigma, USA) can be dissolved in an aqueous solution of NaCl at 0.9%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The following groups (of 4 to 6 animals) are formed by: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> compound 2 (1 mg/kg); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> captopril (1 mg/kg); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> verapamil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> captopril (1 mg/kg)&plus;compound 2 (1 mg/kg); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> verapamil (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg)&plus;compound 2 (1 mg/kg); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> 2) Results: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats present an average arterial pressure varying between 165-190 mm. (cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Treatments by a single intravenous injection of the calcium channel inhibitor verapamil (0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg), or the conversion enzyme inhibitor captopril (1 mg/kg) or the heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor (1 mg/kg) lead to an immediate reduction (less than 2 minutes) in arterial pressure with a return to initial values 20 minutes after the injections are carried out at time 0 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the heart rates measured in these SHR rats, anaesthetized before injection, are between 328 and 371 beats per minute. The heart rates measured in these SHR rats treated with the same products, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, are changed very little by these different treatments. Captopril does not change the heart rate at all, whilst verapamil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) or the G protein inhibitor (1 mg/kg) induce a reduction with a maximum difference (delta) of 32, 56 and 44 respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The combination of several anti-hypertensive agents is frequently prescribed in order to obtain a stabilization of arterial pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The combination of a G protein inhibitor and two other therapeutic classes is illustrated below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that the &ldquo;G protein inhibitor&plus;captopril&rdquo; combination induces a reduction in arterial pressure in the SHR rat higher than the activity of the two products alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows that the G protein inhibitor&plus;captopril combination does not induce a reduction in the heart rate in the SHR rat higher than the activity of the two products alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows that the &ldquo;G protein inhibitor&plus;verapamil&rdquo; combination induces a reduction in arterial pressure in the SHR rat higher than the activity of the two products alone. The &ldquo;G protein inhibitor&plus;verapamil combination at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg&rdquo; gives a profile similar to the action of verapamil alone, but at a dose which is 3 times greater i.e. 0.3 mg/kg (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the results illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and the table below show that the &ldquo;G protein inhibitor&plus;verapamil&rdquo; combination does not induce a reduction in the heart rate in the SHR rat higher than the activity of the two products alone.
