</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns a rain protection arrangement for a golf bag, which has a rain protection cover which can be folded up in a small volume, in a storage compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Golf bags in various different design configurations are known from the prospectus &ldquo;BULLET GOLF, THERE IS NOTHING BETTER&mdash;INNOVATIVE GOLF EQUIPMENT&rdquo;. A golf bag with a rain protection cover which can be folded up in a small volume, in a storage compartment, is known by the name &ldquo;EXECUTIVE 9.5&prime;&rdquo;, wherein the storage compartment is an integral component of the golf bag. This means that, as is known, a rain protection arrangement belongs to the respective golf bag. Such golf bags with an integrated rain protection cover are relatively expensive to buy. If a golfer wants a new golf bag, either he must again buy a correspondingly costly golf bag with integrated rain protection cover or he must buy a golf bag without such a rain protection arrangement. In the latter case therefore the golfer then has a golf bag without a rain protection arrangement, which is also to be viewed as a disadvantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide a rain protection arrangement of the kind set forth in the opening part of this specification, which can be combined easily and without any problem with any golf bag, in order to protect the respective golf bag from the influences of weather such as rain or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, in a rain protection arrangement of the kind set forth in the opening part of this specification, that object is attained in that the storage compartment is in the form of a bag which can temporarily secured to the golf bag by means of a fixing device, wherein the rain protection cover is fixedly connected to the bag along a fixing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The rain protection arrangement according to the invention has the advantage that the bag which contains the rain protection cover can be fixed to any desired golf bag by means of its fixing device in a simple and time-saving manner and if necessary can also be removed from the corresponding golf bag again so that if desired the bag can be temporarily fixed to another golf bag, for example to the bottom end portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The fixing portion, along which the rain protection cover is fixedly connected to the bag, is desirably disposed in the interior of the bag so that it is easily possible for the rain protection cover to be disposed, in a condition of being folded down into a small volume, in the bag, and to close the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> If the respective golf bag is to be protected from the influences of weather such as rain or the like, the bag which is temporarily secured to the golf bag only needs to be opened in order then to pull the rain protection cover which has been folded into a small volume, out of the bag, and to fit from below upwardly over the golf bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The fixing device, by means of which the bag containing the rain protection cover can be temporarily secured to the respective golf bag can be for example in the form of a belt, a fixing strap or the like, so that the bag containing the rain protection cover can be secured to the respective golf bag. It is desirable in that respect if the bag is temporarily secured to the bottom end portion of the golf bag in order to permit virtually protection on all sides for the golf bag from the influences of the weather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The bag of the rain protection arrangement according to the invention can comprise a main bag portion and a closure portion for closing the main bag portion by means of a closure device. The main bag portion and the closure portion can be produced by connecting seams, welded seams or by means of other per se known technologies. The technology which is respectively employed depends on the material of the main bag portion and the closure portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The bag, that is to say the main bag portion and the closure portion, advantageously comprise a material which is impermeable to moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The closure device provided for closing the main bag portion with the closure portion can be formed by a zip closure or a hook-and-loop closure. It is likewise possible for the closure portion to be in the form of a closure flap which overlaps the main bag portion in the closed condition in order to prevent for example rain water from penetrating into the interior of the storage bag. That overlap can be temporarily fixed for example by at least one press stud, a buckle or clasp closure, a zip closure or a hook-and-loop closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The rain protection cover desirably comprises a crease-resistant or non-crease material which is impermeable to moisture. In that respect, by virtue of a suitable choice of material, it is possible to avoid crease folds in the rain protection cover, which are unsightly in the active rain-protective condition. Decorative effects can be achieved by particular coloring of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is desirable if the rain protection cover of the rain protection arrangement according to the invention is provided with a closure flap portion which can be sealingly connected to the rain protection cover by means of a closure device. In that way it is reliably possible for the golf bag or the golfing equipment items such as golf clubs which are in the golf bag to be sealingly covered. The closure device is for example a zip closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The same purpose, that is to say protecting the golf bag or the golf equipment items in the golf bag from the influences of weather such as rain can be served if the rain protection cover can be closed along two longitudinal edges. Such a configuration of the last-mentioned kind affords reliable protection in particular for the golf bag even at its rear side which is away from the rain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To close the rain protection cover, a zip closure or a hook-and-loop closure can be provided at both longitudinal edges. Another possibility provides arranging press studs or buckle or clasp closures at the two longitudinal edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Independently of the respective specific configuration, there is the advantage that the rain protection arrangement according to the invention can be fitted to any golf bag, that is to say it can be combined with any desired golf bag in order reliably to protect it from the influences of weather such as rain. That applies not only in regard to the respective golf bag but in the same manner in regard to the golfing equipment items in the respective golf bag.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view inclinedly from the front showing a golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with pockets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for various items of golfing equipment. The golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a peripherally extending collar portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at its top end, which defines an opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Items of golfing equipment such a golf clubs can be put into the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is temporarily secured by means of a fixing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the lower end portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the lower end portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being stable in respect of shape. The fixing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed for example by a fixing belt which is connected to the bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and which projects therefrom and which has for example a belt clasp or buckle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in order to be able to releasably fix the bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the bottom end portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> forms a storage compartment for a rain protection cover which can be folded down into a small volume and which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in its active condition of use of covering the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the inactive condition in which it is not in use, the rain protection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be disposed in the bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the condition of being folded into a small volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a main bag portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a closure portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The fixing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> projects from the main bag portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Provided between the main bag portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the closure portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a closure device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is formed for example by a zip closure or a hook-and-loop closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The rain protection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which comprises a crease-resistant or non-crease material which is impermeable to moisture is connected in the interior of the bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> along a fixing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or the main bag portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in particular <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the rain protection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be closed along its two longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> adjoining the fixing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For that purpose, press studs or clasp or buckle closures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be provided at those longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Likewise it is possible to provide a zip closure or a hook-and-loop closure at the two longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in order to connect the longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to each other in such a way that virtually a cowl opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> remains in the region of the opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the upper end of the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Along the edge of that cowl opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> the rain protection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided with an elastic element which is for example in the form a piece of elastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The cowl opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provides that, even when the rain protection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in the active condition of use, it is possible for items of golfing equipment such as golf clubs to be put into or removed from the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At the same time the rain protection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> affords excellent protection for the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the items of golfing equipment such as golf clubs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which are in the golf bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
