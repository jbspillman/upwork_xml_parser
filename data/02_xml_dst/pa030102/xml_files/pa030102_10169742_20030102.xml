<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a plate thickness detection method, a plate thickness detector, a reference inter-blade distance detection method, and a reference inter-blade distance detector for a bending machine for bending a workpiece by causing a punch to make a relative stroke and to cooperate with a die in the bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention relates to a bending method and a bending apparatus for directly detecting the relative stroke value of a punch to a die and controlling the relative stroke of the punch by a vertically movable displacement gauge which is provided in the die and protruded from the V groove of the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a bending method and a bending apparatus capable of conducting accurate bending by calculating a D-value in light of a change in the plate thickness of a workpiece which is generated during the bending. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to conventional bending, a nominal plate thickness is input to an NC device and a D-value for a desired bending angle is thereby calculated. An actual plate thickness, however, varies according to the difference in manufacturer or a lot and a desired angle cannot be often obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Considering this, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-157722, the relative pressure of a punch against a die from the torque of a servo motor elevating a ram is measured, and a position corresponding to a rising point of torque is considered as a workpiece upper position so as to detect a plate thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-74746, a plate thickness is measured by setting a point at which the difference between a linear scale value and an NC device instruction value occurs based on the backlash of a ball screw which drives a ram, as a reference point at which a punch contacts with a workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in the method disclosed in 63-157722, it is disadvantageously difficult to detect the rising of pressure for a thin workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, as in the case of the method disclosed in 6-74746, if a point at which the difference between a linear scale value and an NC device instruction value occurs based on the backlash is determined as a point at which a punch contacts with a workpiece, &ldquo;an excessive lash&rdquo; which causes a backlash to enable detection is necessary. This makes it disadvantageously impossible to apply this method to a hydraulic bending machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if a workpiece W is bent by a punch P and a die D cooperatively in a press brake, for example, as a bending apparatus, a ram position detection means <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for detecting the upper and lower positions of a ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is provided so as to measure the distance between the punch P and the die D to thereby obtain a predetermined bending angle. A D-value is calculated in light of die conditions, workpiece conditions and the like, the ram position detection means <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> controls the D-value to bend the workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, even if the predetermined D-value is calculated and the relative distance of the punch P to the die D is controlled to obtain the D-value, mechanical deflections such as the deflections of side plates, those of upper and lower tables and that of the die occur due to the bending reaction of the workpiece W during the bending. Unless these deflections are corrected, bending with accurate angle cannot be ensured. However, it is quite difficult to accurately calculate and correct these mechanical deflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To solve this, as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 6-49374, there is proposed a bending method for directly detecting a D-value without the need to consider mechanical deflections. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this position detection means <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a vertically movable detection pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> protruded from a V groove <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of a die D and provided in the die D to be always urged upward, and detects the vertical movement of the detection pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> using a displacement gauge <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, if a punch P descends to thereby bend the workpiece W downward, then the lower surface of the workpiece W which is being bent is abutted on the detection pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to press the pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> down. The descent of the detection pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is detected by the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to thereby directly detect a D-value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Even with the conventional art, however, it is difficult to accurately calculate the relative stroke value of the punch P to obtain a target bending angle because of the various characteristics of the workpiece W, e.g., spring-back by which if the workpiece W is unloaded after being bent, the bending angle recovers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, with both the method shown in 63-15772 and that shown in 6-74746 as described above, a phenomenon that the actual plate thickness of the workpiece changes (decreases) during bending occurs. According to each method, the D-value is calculated not in light of the decrease of the thickness but based on the detection of the position at which the punch contacts with the workpiece at the start of bending. Since the D-value is not calculated in light of the thickness change (decrease) after the bending completely starts, the method has a disadvantage in that a target angle cannot be accurately obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made while paying attention to the above-stated conventional disadvantages and the object of the present invention is to provide a plate thickness detection method, a plate thickness detector, a reference inter-blade distance detection method and a reference inter-blade distance detector for a bending machine capable of accurately detecting the actual plate thickness of a workpiece during bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention has been made while paying attention to the above-stated conventional disadvantages and the object of the present invention is to provide a bending method and a bending apparatus capable of accurately calculating the relative stroke value of a punch for a target bending angle and carrying out bending with high accuracy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which serves as a bending apparatus according to the present invention. Since the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is already well known, it will be described only schematically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has left and right side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R each of which has a gap G in a central portion on entire surfaces and is generally C shaped, and an upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U which serves as a ram is provided to be vertically movable on the front surface of the upper portion of each of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R. This upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U has a punch P which is attached to the lower end of the table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U through an intermediate plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in an exchangeable fashion and is vertically moved by a ram driving means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> including a hydraulic cylinder, a motor, a ball spring and so on provided on the upper portion of each of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R. A ram position detection means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such as an encoder or linear scale for detecting the upper and lower positions of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U is provided. Further, a bending load detector which serves as a bending load detection means is attached to the ram driving means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a lower table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L is provided on the front surface of the lower portion of each of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, and a die D is attached to the upper end of this lower table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L through a die holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in an exchangeable fashion. A V-groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>) for bending a workpiece W is provided on the upper portion of the die D in the longitudinal direction of the die D. Further, a controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> controlling the ram driving means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the like, to be described later, is provided in the vicinity of the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> With the above-stated configuration, the punch P is descended by the ram driving means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> toward the workpiece W which is positioned between the punch and the die D, the ram position detection means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> detects the upper and lower positions of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which serves as a ram, the controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> controls the position of the punch P, and the punch P and the die D cooperatively bend the workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> plurality of displacement gauges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are provided in the die D in the longitudinal direction of the die D. Each of the displacement gauges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is provided with a detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is always urged upward by a spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and which is protruded vertically movably from the V groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the die D, and with a linear scale <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for detecting the upper and lower positions of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the workpiece W which is bent by the punch P presses the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> down, the linear scale <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> detects the upper and lower positions of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the time of being pressed, and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the distance DSt between the upper end portion of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the die D is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A plate thickness detection method, a plate thickness detector, a reference inter-blade distance detection method and a reference inter-blade distance detector as the first embodiment of the present invention will first be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of the controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or a central processing unit, to which an input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a keyboard for inputting various data and an output means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such as a CRT for displaying the various data are connected. Further, the ram position detection means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the displacement gauges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that a detection signal can be transmitted to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> storing the various data and a plate thickness arithmetic operation section <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which calculates the plate thickness of the workpiece W mounted on the die D from the stroke quantity of the punch P detected by the ram position detection means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the movement quantities of the displacement gauges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> detected by the displacement gauges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as will be described later, are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. As will be described later, a reference inter-blade distance arithmetic operation section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which calculates a reference inter-blade distance which is the inter-blade distance between the punch P and the die D as a reference to be employed for the arithmetic operation of the plat thickness, is also connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A method for measuring the plate thickness T of the workpiece W will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> First, a method for measuring the plate thickness of the workpiece W by descending the ram from a top dead center (i.e., the top dead center of the punch P) will be described. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an open height is denoted by H, the height of an intermediate plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is denoted by HB, the height of the punch P is denoted by HP, the height of the die D is denoted by HD and the height of the die holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is denoted by HC. Accordingly, these are known values in the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and so is well known the reference inter-blade distance&equals;H&minus;HB&minus;HP&minus;HC&minus;HD. Further, the stroke of the punch P from the top dead center in a downward direction is denote by PSt as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and that of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the upper surface of the die D in the downward direction is denoted by DSt as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> measures the stroke DSt downward with the upper surface position of the die D set as an origin. Using a calibration tool <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> having a polished lower surface, this displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> obtains the origin in advance. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if the workpiece W is warped to be convex upward, the sign of the initial value of DSt is minus. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, if the workpiece W is warped to be convex downward, the sign of the initial value of DSt is plus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the stroke PSt of the punch P and the stroke DSt of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> relative to time. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes the contact point between the punch P and the workpiece W and a point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a predetermined point after bending starts. In addition, a stroke PSt<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes the stroke value of the punch P relative to the point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a stroke PSt<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes the stroke value of the punch P relative to the point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a stroke DSt<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&equals;0) denotes the stroke value of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> relative to the point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a stroke DSt<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes the stroke value of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> relative to the point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, if the plate thickness detection starts (in a step SS), the values of the open height H, the height HB of the intermediate plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the height HP of the punch P, the height HD of the die D and the height HC of the die holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are input (in a step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). If these values are already input and stored in the memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, they are invoked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As already stated above, using the calibration tool <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> having a polished lower surface, the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is subjected to calibration (in a step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Namely, the upper surface position of the die D is set at DSt&equals;0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U, as a ram, is descended by the ram driving means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to start bending (in a step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), it is determined whether or not the punch P contacts with the workpiece W (or whether or not the punch P contacts with the workpiece W and then bent by a certain quantity as indicated by the point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) (in a step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U is descended back to the step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, if it is determined that the punch P contacts with the workpiece W, the stroke value PSt of the punch P and the stroke value DSt of the detection piece <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the time of the determination are obtained, and the plate thickness T of the workpiece W is obtained from T&equals;H&minus;(HB&plus;HP&plus;HD&plus;HC&plus;PSt)&plus;DSt (in a step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), thereby completing the measurement of the plate thickness (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If the determination is made with reference to the contact between the punch P and the workpiece W, the PSt<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DSt<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&equals;0) are employed as PSt and DSt, respectively. If the determination is made with reference to the progress of bending by a certain degree, the PSt<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and DSt<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are employed as PSt and DSt, respectively. However, if the bending progresses so largely, the plate thickness is decreased by the bending. It is, therefore, desirable to detect the plate thickness so as not to excessively bend the workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Since the plate thickness T of the workpiece W is calculated using the open height H, it is desirable that the frames such as the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R of the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are less thermally deformed so as not to change the open height H. That is, a press brake of such a type as to drive a hydraulic cylinder by a bidirectional pump as the ram driving means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (hybrid press brake) is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Next, a method for measuring the plate thickness T of the workpiece W without reference to the top dead center of the ram as described above will be described. In this method, a reference inter-blade distance a is set as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, using a workpiece W the plate thickness T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of which is known, the reference inter-blade distance a is obtained from a&equals;PSt&plus;T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&minus;DSt and stored in the memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the punch P is descended toward the workpiece W for which the plate thickness T is to be measured and the plate thickness T is obtained from T&equals;a&minus;(PSt&minus;DSt). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, if calibration bending starts (in a step SS), the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is subjected to calibration with reference to the upper surface of the die D as already described (in a step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Bending starts to the workpiece W having the known plate thickness T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and it is determined whether or not the punch P contacts with the workpiece W (in a step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). If the punch P does not contact with the workpiece W, the processing returns to the step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in which the punch P is descended. If it is determined that the punch P contacts with the workpiece W, then the stroke value PSt of the punch P and the stroke value DSt of the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at the time of the contact are obtained, the reference inter-blade distance a is calculated from a&equals;PSt&plus;T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&minus;DSt (in a step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) and the calibration bending is thereby ended (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, if product bending starts (in a step SS), the punch P is descended toward the workpiece W the plate thickness T of which is unknown to conduct bending (in a step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). It is determined whether or not the punch P contacts with the workpiece W (in a step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and the punch P is descended until it contacts with the workpiece W. If the punch P contacts with the workpiece W, then the stroke PSt of the punch P and the stroke DSt of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at the time of the contact are obtained, the plate thickness T is obtained from T&equals;a&minus;(PSt&minus;DSt) (in a step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the product bending is ended (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If the plate thickness T is obtained as stated above, the plate thickness T can be measured without giving consideration to the influence of the thermal deformations of the frames of the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as described above. Further, since the ram top dead center is not set as a reference, it is possible to cause the punch P to make a stroke from an arbitrary position and to measure the plate thickness T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The above-stated results evidence that the plate thickness T can be detected if the stroke PSt of the punch P and the stroke DSt of the detection pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be detected at the same time after bending starts. Therefore, it is possible to measure the plate thickness T at a bending start point, a point at which bending progresses by a certain degree (or a point at which a bending quantity exceeds a certain threshold) or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, even if the workpiece W is warped, it is possible to accurately measure the plate thickness T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a bending method and a bending apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> controller <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes a CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or a central processing unit, to which an input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a keyboard for inputting various data and an output means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such as a CRT for displaying the various data are connected. In addition, a database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which will be described later, a data correction section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> correcting the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by a method which will be described later, a comparison determination section <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> comparing the measured bending angle of the bent workpiece W with a target angle, and a stroke instruction section <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> controlling a vertical cylinder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and thereby controlling the stroke of the punch P, are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Further, a displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is connected so that a detection signal can be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the bending method according to the second embodiment will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When a processing starts (in a step SS), bending conditions such as a bending angle, die conditions including a die groove angle DA, a die V width V, a die shoulder are DR and a punch tip end are PR, material conditions including an n-power law hardening exponent, Young&apos;s modulus E and a plastic coefficient F, and the plate thickness are input (in a step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Using a graph showing the relationship between the bending angle and the inter-blade distance stored in the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> or a calculation expression, an inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at an insertion angle to obtain a desired bending angle (90 degrees in this case) is obtained (in a step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). In other words, the graph or calculation expression showing the relationship between the bending angle and the inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shows a finishing angle which is an actual bending angle and an insertion angle in consideration of a spring back quantity calculated from material conditions for each material in advance, it is possible to obtain the insertion angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, bending starts (in a step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, while observing the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the inter-blade distance is driven to the target blade distance ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtained in the step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). If the distance reaches the target inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the workpiece W is unloaded (in a step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The punch P is separated from the die D to take out the workpiece W (in a step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>), and a finishing angle &thgr;&prime; is measured (in a step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). It is then determined whether or not the finishing angle is within a tolerance (in a step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). If it is determined that the finishing angle is within a tolerance, the inter-blade distance is recorded as a final inter-blade distance ST for the material conditions and bending conditions at this time (in a step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) and the bending is ended (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if it is determined that the finishing angle is not within the tolerance, the relationship between the bending angle &thgr; and the inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is corrected to obtain a corrected inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). As this correction method, a method for correcting the distance while assuming that Young&apos;s modulus E has no change and a method for correcting the distance while assuming that the n-value has no change may be employed. Description will now be given while taking a target bending angle of 90 degrees as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> First, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, in the correction method on the assumption that the Young&apos;s modulus E, i.e., spring back has no change, a finishing angle line is corrected so as to pass the intersection P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relative to the target bending angle of 90 degrees before correction and the actual finishing angle &thgr;&prime;. Since the angle difference between the insertion angle and the finishing angle has no change between before-correction and after-correction, an insertion angle line and a finishing angle line are displaced by a quantity proportional to the difference &thgr;&prime;&minus;90 between the target bending angle of 90 degrees and the measured finishing angle &thgr;&prime; at the center of one point (indicated by broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, respectively). As a result, the inter-blade distance ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after the correction is obtained from the intersection P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the target bending angle of 90 degrees and the finishing angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As other methods for displacing the insertion angle line and the finishing angle line, there are a method for offsetting a displacement quantity in parallel, a method for re-calculating an inter-blade distance at each angle using the reciprocal of a material constant and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the correction method on the assumption that the n-value, i.e., a plastic range has no change, the insertion angle does not change. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the finishing angle line is displaced by the difference &thgr;&prime;&minus;90 between the target bending angle of 90 degrees and the measured finishing angle &thgr;&prime; (indicated by a broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As methods for displacing the finishing angle line, there are a method for offsetting displacement quantities in parallel, a method for re-calculating an inter-blade distance at each angle using the reciprocal of the material constant besides a method for displacing the line at the center of one point, as in the case of the correction method on the assumption that the Young&apos;s modulus E has no change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Next, the workpiece W which has been bent is re-set and a drive-in processing starts (in a step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>), followed by a step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to repeat the steps after the step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Here, if the finishing angle &thgr;&prime; measured previously is not more than 90 degrees, the workpiece W is already bent excessively. Therefore, a new workpiece W is used to start over bending without using the previously bent workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> From the above-stated results, the bending angle obtained by the first bending is measured and the graph or calculation expression showing the relationship between the bending angle and the inter-blade distance ST is corrected based on the difference between the measured angle and the target angle, so that it is possible to obtain an accurate inter-blade distance ST for the bending angle. It is thereby possible to bend workpieces W of the same material at accurate angle by once bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Next, the third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> controller <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes a CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or a central processing unit, to which an input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a keyboard for inputting various data and an output means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such as a CRT for displaying the various data are connected. Further, a displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> already described above and a bending load detector <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> which is a bending load detection means are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that a detection signal can be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> storing the various data input from the input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the relationship between stroke value and angle and that between stroke value and load, a stroke value-angle correction means <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for correcting the stroke value-angle relationship stored in the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> based on a measured stroke value and a measure bending load while bending a workpiece using the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the bending load detector <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a stroke value calculation means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for calculating a new target stroke value from the stroke value-angle relationship corrected by this stroke value-angle correction means <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and a stroke instruction section <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> controlling a vertical cylinder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and thereby control the stroke of a punch P, are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A bending method according to the third embodiment will next be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> When a processing starts (in a step SS), bending conditions such as a target bending angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, die conditions including a die groove angle DA, a die V width V, a die shoulder are DR and a punch tip end are PR, material conditions including an n-power law hardening exponent, Young&apos;s modulus E and a plastic coefficient F and a plate thickness t and the like are input from the input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, the stroke value calculation means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> calculates the target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the punch P for a target bending angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> from the stroke value-bending angle &thgr; relationship stored in the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). Namely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> for the inputted target bending angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (e.g., 90 degrees) is calculated from the stroke value-bending angle relationship &thgr; obtained by an experiment or the like in advance and stored in the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Bending starts for the target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>), the actual plate thickness of the workpiece W is measured by an external plate thickness measurement means such as a caliper (in a step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). Alternatively, the actual plate thickness may be measured before the bending start and input as a bending condition in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As already shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the stroke value ST is measured using the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> while the punch P is relatively descended, a load F at this time is detected by the bending load detector <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and bending-bending loads F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for a plurality of (e. g., two to four, three or one) arbitrary stroke values ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are detected until the stroke value ST reaches a target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> (in a step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As the bending load detector <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic sensor may be employed in a hydraulic press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The bending load can be measured from the torque of a motor in a press brake using a ball spring. Alternatively, the bending load may be detected by attaching a gauge to each frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Next, the stroke-angle correction section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> obtains a stroke value correction quantity a based on the three couples of stroke value and bending load value (ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and (ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) obtained in the step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). Here, the correction quantity a is a function of the actual plate thickness, bending loads at certain stroke positions (ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and (ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), die conditions, a material constant, the target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the target bending angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the like. That is, the correction quantity a is given by a&equals;f(actual plate thickness, bending loads at certain stroke positions (ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and (ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), die conditions, material constant, target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, target bending angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The stroke-angle correction section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> corrects the target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> using the correction quantity a as described above, thereby obtaining (corrected target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>)&equals;(previous target stroke value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>)&minus;a (in a step S<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). The stroke instruction section <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> causes the punch P to make a stroke relative to the corrected target value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and if it is determined that the target stroke value reaches the corrected target value ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>), the bending is ended (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from these results, a bending load for a certain stroke value is measured until the stroke value reaches a stroke value for the tentative target angle obtained from the stroke value-angle relationship stored in the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, this measured value is compared with the stroke value-load relationship stored in the database <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in advance to thereby correct the stroke value-angle relationship. It is, therefore, possible to calculate a true stroke value for a target bending angle. It is possible to carry out bending with high accuracy, accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Finally, the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> First, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26, a</cross-reference> controller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> includes a CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or a central processing unit, to which an input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a keyboard for inputting various data and an output means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such as a CRT for displaying the various data are connected. A displacement gauge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is also connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that a detection signal can be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Further, a spring back quantity arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> for calculating a spring back quantity &Dgr;&thgr; based on the inputted bending conditions, an insertion angle arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> for calculating an insertion angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the spring back quantity &Dgr;&thgr;, a workpiece radius-of-curvature arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> for calculating the radius of curvature &rgr; of a workpiece W right under a punch P based on the insertion angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a stroke arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> for obtaining a target insertion angle &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on a before-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is a true plate thickness before bending starts, a plate thickness arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for calculating an after-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at bending end time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the calculated radius of curvature &rgr; of the workpiece W and the before-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a final stroke arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for calculating a final stroke (bottom position) from the before-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the after-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. It is noted that a stroke instruction section <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> instructing a vertical cylinder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to elevate the punch is also connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A bending method according to the fourth embodiment will next be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The plate thickness measurement means <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> such as caliper measures the plate thickness of the workpiece W and the before-ending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>) which is a true plate thickness is input from the input means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) and the plate thickness arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> calculates a bending quantity at the before-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining a stroke value ST and the after-bending plate thickness T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the workpiece W after bending right under the punch P (in a step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the final stroke arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> calculates a target bottom position ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> on the lower surface of the workpiece W from ST&equals;ST&minus;(T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) (in a step S<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) and bending is conducted down to the target bottom position ST<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
