<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a hydraulic circuit in a press brake according to a prior art, an upper cylinder chamber and a lower cylinder chamber in a hydraulic cylinder which moves a ram, for example, an upper table or the like are respectively connected to a switch valve via piping. However, since an opening degree of the switch valve and a supply flow amount to the upper cylinder chamber and the lower cylinder chamber in the hydraulic cylinder are not in a linear relationship, it is impossible to monitor a speed on the basis of the opening degree of the switch valve. Accordingly, the ram speed is monitored only by a ram sensor. Therefore, there has been a problem that the ram speed can not be corrected if the ram sensor gets out of order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention has been made by paying attention to the problem in the prior art mentioned above, and an object of this invention is to provide a ram speed monitoring method in a press brake which can secure a safety of an operation and a press brake using this ram speed monitoring method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another object of this invention is to provide a ram position control method employing a hydraulic cylinder which can position a ram at a commanded position with no relationship to a pressure and a temperature of a working fluid supplied from a hydraulic pump to a hydraulic cylinder, and an apparatus therefor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the object mentioned above, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a ram speed monitoring method in a press brake comprising the steps of: moving a ram upward and downward by moving a hydraulic cylinder upward and downward according to a rotational direction of a two-way fluid pump; determining a first ram moving speed on the basis of a change of ram position by directly detecting a position of the ram by ram position detecting means; detecting a rotational number of a servo motor which rotates and drives the two-way fluid pump so as to compute an amount of a working fluid discharged from the two-way fluid pump on the basis of the rotational number and compute a second ram moving speed on the basis of a moving speed of the hydraulic cylinder which moves the ram; and comparing the first ram moving speed with the second ram moving speed and judging that an abnormality is generated in the case that the speeds are different at a predetermined amount or more so as to control the servo motor for immediately stopping a working, whereby a bending process is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the ram speed monitoring method in the press brake according to the invention mentioned above, on one hand the vertical position of the ram is directly detected and the first ram moving speed is determined on the basis of the change of the detected position, and on the other hand the second ram moving speed is determined by computing the amount of the working fluid supplied to the hydraulic cylinder in which the two-way fluid pump moves the ram upward and downward on the basis of the rotational number of the servo motor, so that in the case that a difference equal to or more than the predetermined amount exists at a time of comparing two ram moving speeds determined on the basis of the different paths, it is judged that the abnormality is generated, whereby the servo motor is immediately stopped and the working is stopped. Accordingly, even in the case that an accurate ram moving speed can not be determined in one path, it is possible to secure a safety of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a press brake using a ram speed monitoring method comprising: a ram capable of moving upward and downward; a hydraulic cylinder moving the ram upward and downward; a two-way fluid pump operating the hydraulic cylinder so as to move the ram upward and downward, the two-way fluid pump moving the ram upward and downward by switching a rotational direction; ram position detecting means for detecting a vertical position of the ram; servo motor rotational number detecting means for detecting a rotational number of a servo motor which rotates and drives the two-way fluid pump; and a control apparatus controlling the servo motor, wherein the control apparatus comprises: a first speed arithmetic operating portion computing a first ram moving speed on the basis of a position signal output from the ram position detecting means; a second speed arithmetic operating portion computing a second ram moving speed on the basis of a signal output from the servo motor rotational number detecting means; a comparing portion comparing the first ram moving speed with the second ram moving speed; and a judging portion judging that an abrasion is generated in the case that both of the ram moving speeds are different at a predetermined amount or more as a result of the comparison carried out by the comparing portion, and commanding so as to stop the servo motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, on one hand the vertical position of the ram is directly detected by the ram position detecting means and the first ram moving speed is determined on the basis of the change of the detected position by the first speed arithmetic operating portion. At the same time, the rotational number of the servo motor is determined by the servo motor rotational number detecting means for the purpose of determining the amount of the working fluid supplied from the two-way fluid pump to the hydraulic cylinder which moves the ram upward and downward by the servo motor rotational number detecting means, and the vertical moving speed of the ram is determined by the second speed arithmetic operating portion on the basis of the rotational number of the servo motor. According to the way mentioned above, the comparing portion compares the first ram speed and the second ram speed which correspond to two ram moving speeds determined on the basis of the different paths. In the case that a difference equal to or more than the predetermined amount exists, the judging portion judges that the abnormality is generated and immediately stops the servo motor so as to stop the working. Accordingly, even in the case that an accurate ram moving speed can not be determined in one path, it is possible to secure a safety of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a ram position control method in a press brake comprising the steps of: operating a hydraulic pump by a servo motor; moving a ram upward and downward by using a hydraulic cylinder operated by a working fluid supplied from the hydraulic pump; rotating the servo motor on the basis of a position command; feeding back a position signal output from a ram position detector which detects a position of the ram, at a time when the step is carried out; determining a position compensation value on the basis of a relationship of a deviation amount of the ram position with respect to a pressure and an oil temperature in the hydraulic cylinder which are previously obtained, in conjunction with an execution of the step; correcting the position command so as to rotate the servo motor; and applying a bending process to a work on the basis of a cooperation between a punch and a die which are provided in the ram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the hydraulic pump is operated by rotating the servo motor according to the position command, and the ram is moved upward and downward by supplying the working fluid to the hydraulic cylinder. A height position of the ram at this time is detected by the ram position detector and is fed back. Further, the pressure and the oil temperature of the working fluid in the hydraulic cylinder at this time is detected, and the position compensation amount is determined on the basis of the relationship of the deviation amount of the ram position with respect to the pressure and the oil temperature which are previously obtained. Then the corrected position command is output to the servo motor. Therefore it is possible to accurately position the ram at a predetermined position without relationship to the pressure and the oil temperature of the working fluid. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the servo motor is rotated and the hydraulic pump is operated according to the position command output from the position command portion, and the working fluid is supplied to the hydraulic cylinder so as to move the ram upward and downward. The height position of the ram at this time is detected by the ram position detector is fed back. Further, the oil temperature of the working fluid is detected by the oil temperature sensor as well as the pressure of the working fluid in the hydraulic cylinder at this time is detected by the pressure sensor, and the monitoring portion monitors the pressure and the oil temperature, determines the position compensation amount on the basis of the relationship of the deviation amount of the ram position with respect to the pressure and the oil temperature which are previously obtained and stored in the memory, and corrects the position command to the servo motor. Therefore it is possible to accurately position the ram at a predetermined position without relationship to the pressure and the oil temperature of the working fluid.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a hydraulic circuit in a press brake on the basis of a first embodiment of the present invention. In this hydraulic circuit, an upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>U and a lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>L in a hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which moves a ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, for example, of an upper table or the like are connected to a switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> respectively via pipes <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is connected to an oil tank <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> via a hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> rotated by a motor <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through a pipe <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and is directly connected to the oil tank <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> through a pipe <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Further, the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is controlled by amplifying a control signal output from an NC apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> by an amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and a moving state (that is, an opening degree) of the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is detected by a position sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> so as to be fed back to the NC apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, whereby a servo system is constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A ram sensor <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> detecting a vertical movement of the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is provided, and this ram sensor <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is connected to the NC apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a control signal output from the NC apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is amplified by the amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> so as to be fed to the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, thereby switching an upward movement, a stop and a downward movement of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and performing an upward movement, a stop and a downward movement of the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. That is, in a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, since the working fluid supplied from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is directly returned to the oil tank <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> via the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, when moving the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in a right direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the working fluid supplied from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is supplied to the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>L of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> via the pipe <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The working fluid in the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>U is returned to the oil tank <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> via the pipes <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, so that the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> moves upward. An upward moving speed of the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at this time is changed in correspondence to a discharge amount from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, that is, an opening degree of the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further, when moving the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in a left direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the working fluid supplied from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is supplied to the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>U of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> via the pipe <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and the working fluid in the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>L is returned to the oil tank <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> via the pipes <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, so that the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> moves downward. A downward moving speed of the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at this time is changed in correspondence to the discharge amount from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, that is, the opening degree of the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this case, a state of the upward movement and the downward movement in the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is detected by the ram sensor <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> so as to be sent to the NC apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and the NC apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> monitors the position of the ram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on the basis of the detection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a flow of a ram position control in a press brake <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment. This press brake <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is structured such as to move an upper table <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>U corresponding to a ram to which a punch P is attached, upward and downward by a hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and apply a bending process to a work in cooperation with a die D attached to a lower table <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> That is, a position command output from a position command portion <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is sent to a gain determining portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> via an adder <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. The gain determining portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> determines a ram motion gain, and amplifies the command by an amplifier <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> so as to output the command to a servo motor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. A hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is operated by the servo motor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is moved upward and downward so as to move the upper table <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>U upward and downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, a vertical position of the upper table <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>U is detected by a ram position detector <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, and is fed back to the adder <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> via a position counter <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, thereby constituting a servo loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given of a third embodiment according to the present invention. The third embodiment corresponds to an improvement of the first embodiment mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> That is, in the first embodiment mentioned above, since the opening degree of the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the supply flow amount to the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are not in the linear relationship as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is not possible to monitor the speed on the basis of the opening degree of the switch valve <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the ram speed is monitored only by the ram sensor <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Even in this case, the moving speed of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U is determined on the basis of two different paths in the same manner as that of rapidly moving downward, and in the case that the difference is equal to or more than a predetermined amount, the working is immediately stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this case, since a cross sectional area in a lower surface side of the piston <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>R is smaller than that in an upper surface side, an amount of the working fluid returning to the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>L is less than an amount of the working fluid injected into the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>U, so that the working fluid is supplemented from the oil tank <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> via the check valve <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the case of inverting the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>R so as to move the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U upward, the AC servo motor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is rotated in an opposite direction to that in the case mentioned above on the basis of an inverting command so as to reverse rotate the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>l, and the working fluid supplied from the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>U in a state in which the piston <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>R moves downward is supplied to the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>L through the pipe <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the pipe <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the switch valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the pipe <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the like.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Even in this case, the moving speed of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U is determined on the basis of two different paths in the same manner as that of the cases of rapidly moving downward and the bending process, and in the case that the difference is equal to or more than a predetermined amount, the working is immediately stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the pressure of the working fluid injected into the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>L becomes higher than a predetermined value, the prefill valve <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is opened on the basis of a pilot signal <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and the working fluid is fed to the oil tank <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> from the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>U through the prefill valve <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> According to the results mentioned above, on one hand, the position of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U is directly detected and the moving speed of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U corresponding to the ram is determined on the basis of the change of the detected position, on the other hand, the ram moving speed is determined on the basis of the amount of the working fluid supplied to the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>U or the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>L in the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>R which moves the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U upward and downward by the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the working is immediately stopped in the case that it is judged that the abnormality exists, by comparing both of the ram moving speeds. Accordingly, if one ram moving speed monitoring means is out of order, another ram moving speed monitoring means is operated, so that it is possible to secure a safety of the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, if a working program run away in a software, it is possible to immediately detect this, and it is possible to keep a safety in the operation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> According to the structure mentioned above, in the case of rapidly moving the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U downward due to its own weight of the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U and by means of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>R, from a state in which the working fluid is charged into the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>U and the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>L, the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is stopped and the piston <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>R is in a top dead center, the pipe <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is communicated with the pipe <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> by switching the sequence switch valve <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>, and the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is rotated by the AC servo motor <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the case of moving further downward so as to execute the bending process, the sequence switch valve <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> is made in a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and the working fluid supplied from the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>L is returned to the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> through the pipe <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, the counter balance valve <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> and the pipe <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight>, and is further supplied to the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>U of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>R through the pipe <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the piston <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>R moves downward and the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Umoves downward, whereby the bending process is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this case, since across sectional area in a lower surface side of the piston <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>R is smaller than that in an upper surface side, an amount of the working fluid returning to the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> from the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>L is less than an amount of the working fluid injected into the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>U, so that the working fluid is supplemented from the oil tank <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> via the check valve <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the case of moving the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U upward, the sequence switch valve <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is switched to the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and the AC servo motor <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> is rotated in an opposite direction to that in the case mentioned above on the basis of an inverting command output from the position command portion <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> so as to reverse rotate the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, whereby the working fluid supplied from the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>U in a state in which the piston <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>R moves downward is supplied to the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>L through the pipe <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, the two-way piston pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, the pipe <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, the sequence switch valve <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>, the pipe <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and the like. Accordingly, the piston <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>R moves upward and the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U moves upward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the pressure of the working fluid injected into the lower cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>L becomes higher than a predetermined value, the prefill valve <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is opened on the basis of a pilot signal <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, and the working fluid is fed to the oil tank <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> from the upper cylinder chamber <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>U through the prefill valve <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Further, at a time of positioning the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U at the fixed position, the ram motion gain determining portion <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight> determines the ram motion gain on the basis of the position command of the position command portion <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> and the position signal output from the linear scale <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the monitoring portion <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> monitors the oil temperature output from the oil temperature sensor <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> and the pressure output from the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, determines the ram position deviation amount on the basis of the data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>, correct the position command so as to amplify by the amplifier <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>, and outputs the command to the AC servo motor <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> According to the results mentioned above, it is possible to accurately position the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U at the predetermined position without being affected by the pressure and the oil temperature of the working fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this case, this invention is not limited to the embodiment according to the invention mentioned above, and can be carried out according to the other aspects by applying a suitable change. That is, in the embodiment according to the invention mentioned above, the description is given of the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U is moved upward and downward, however, just the same structure is applied to a press brake in which the lower table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L is moved upward and downward. </paragraph>
