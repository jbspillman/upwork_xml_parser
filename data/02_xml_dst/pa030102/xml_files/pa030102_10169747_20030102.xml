<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a bending method and a bending device for bending a workpiece by relatively making a punch approach and separate to and from a die using at least two left and right driving shafts. More specifically, the present invention relates to a bending method and a bending device for clamping a workpiece by the workpiece clamper of a robot provided on the front side of a bending machine which bends the workpiece in cooperation with a punch and a die and for positioning the workpiece to a predetermined position between the punch and the die. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There is conventionally known that a press brake, which is a bending machine, ascends and descends a punch attached to an upper table relatively to a die attached to a lower table and thereby bends a workpiece in cooperation with the punch and the die. According to the conventional art, however, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if a workpiece W is set at a position offset in the longitudinal direction of a punch P and a die D, the workpiece W is to be so-called offset-bent. Due to this, a D-value (relative distance between the punch and the die) becomes non-uniform and a bending progress portion and a bending delay portion occur. Therefore, the conventional art has a disadvantage in that the passage angle of the workpiece W does not coincide with a target angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to the conventional art, however, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if a workpiece W is set at a position offset in the longitudinal direction of a punch P and a die D, the workpiece W is to be so-called offset-bent. Due to this, a D-value (relative distance between the punch and the die) becomes non-uniform and a bending progress portion and a bending delay portion occur. Therefore, the conventional art has a disadvantage in that the passage angle of the workpiece W does not coincide with a target angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, if a part of the workpiece W is bent cooperatively by the punch P and the die D, an unbent portion is disadvantageously bent by the mutual influence of the punch P and the die D and the bending angle of a part of a bent portion disadvantageously decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, if the workpiece W is to be bent cooperatively by the punch P and the die D, the workpiece W is bent using a robot so as to follow up the spring of the workpiece W while clamping the workpiece by the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the robot or opening the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this case, following the stroke position of the punch P, the position of the workpiece W when the workpiece W springs is subjected to a circular interpolation about of the shoulder section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the die D and the follow-up coordinate of the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the robot is thereby calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to such conventional art, however, since the spring position of the workpiece is arithmetically operated based on the position of the die, the accurate workpiece spring position cannot be disadvantageously obtained. Further, since the conventional art cannot accurately deal with the bending speed and accurately follow up the bending speed in the end, &ldquo;the buckling of the workpiece&rdquo; and the like disadvantageously occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if bending is executed in a state in which pressure which horizontally acts on the workpiece is not uniform, whether offset bending or center bending, the right, center and left of the workpiece have different bending speeds. Due to this, even if a passage angle is eventually obtained, the workpiece is not always bent at a uniform insertion angle during the bending. Accordingly, if the robot or the like follows up bending, it is required to change the follow-up speed according to the clamp positions of the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, thereby disadvantageously making the operation quite laborious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the above-stated situations, the present invention has been achieved while paying attention to the conventional technical disadvantages stated above. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a bending method and a bending device capable of improving a bending passage angle by correcting a bending speed at a position in the longitudinal direction of a punch and a die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a bending method and a bending device capable of accurately following up the spring of a workpiece using a robot. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> show a press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which serves as a bending device according to the present invention. Since the bending brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> itself is already well known, it will be described only schematically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has left and right side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R each of which has a gap G in a central portion on the front surface of each of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R and is generally C shaped, and an upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U on the front surface of the upper portion of each of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R. A punch P is attached to the lower end portion of this upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U in an exchangeable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a die D is attached to the front surface of the lower portion of each of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R in an exchangeable manner, and the die D is vertically moved by vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R which are provided on the front surfaces of the lower portions of the side plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, respectively. In addition, a crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for lifting the longitudinal central portion of the die D is provided at the center of the lower table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is noted that a V-groove <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) for bending a workpiece W is provided on the upper portion of the die D in the longitudinal direction of the die D. Further, a controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which controls the vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R and the like is provided in the vicinity of the press brake <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With the above-stated configuration, the die D is ascended by the vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R relatively to the workpiece W which is positioned between the punch P and the die D and the workpiece W is bent cooperatively by the punch P and the die D. At this moment, if the central portion of the die D is deflected, the central portion of the die is lifted by the crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> so as to improve the passage of the workpiece W in the longitudinal direction of the die D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> plurality of (three in this embodiment) displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which serve as position detection means are provided in the die D in the longitudinal direction of the die D. Each of these displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with a detection pin <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is always urged upward by a spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and which is vertically movably protruded from the V-groove <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the die D, and is provided with a linear scale <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which detects the upper and lower positions of this detection pin <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the workpiece W, which is pressed and bent by the relative descent of the punch P by ascending the die D by the vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R, presses the detection pin <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> relatively downward, the upper and lower positions of the detection pin <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at this time are detected by the linear scale <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the distance between the upper end portion of the detection pin <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the die D is obtained as the position H of the lower surface of the workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes a CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or a central processing unit, to which an input means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, such as a keyboard, for inputting various data and an output means <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, such as a CRT, for displaying the various data are connected. In addition, the displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that respective stroke detection signals can be transmitted to the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a bending speed calculation section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which calculates bending speeds at the positions of the displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from stroke detection signals from the displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively, a uniform speed arithmetic operation section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which calculates a speed for making the obtained bending speeds at the respective positions uniform, and a driving shaft instruction section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which controls the vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R and the crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to thereby control the stroke of the die D so as to bend the workpiece W at a uniform bending speed, are connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, a bending method according to the present invention by employing history control will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When bending starts (in a step SS), it is determined whether or not RDC (Real Depth Control) control is conducted (in a step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). If the RDC control is not conducted, a conventional processing is carried out (in a step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the bending is ended (in a step SE). The RDC control means herein directly measuring and controlling the distance from the upper surface of the die D to the lower surface of the workpiece W which is being bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> If the RDC control is conducted, the vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R are controlled to ascend the die D up to a hit point at which the punch P and the die hit against each other (in a step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned on to check the number of displacement gauges which are turned on (in a step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If the number of displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are turned on is zero (in a step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), a conventional processing is carried (in a step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the bending is ended (in the step SE). If the number of displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are turned on is not zero and the number thereof is not 1 (in a step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), then history control to be described later is conducted (in a step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), the positions of the displacement gauges are controlled to reach RDC target positions (in a step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and the bending is ended (in the step SE). If the number of the displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are turned on is one in the step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, then the history control is not conducted but the positions of the displacement gauges are controlled to reach the RDC target positions (in the step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and the bending is ended (in the step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The history control will next be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The basic concept of the history control will first be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, if offset bending is to be conducted, the workpiece W is offset to, for example, the left side. Therefore, load is, mainly applied to the left side of the workpiece W and the distance between blades widens as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>. As a result, the bending angle of the left side of the workpiece W is smaller than that at a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C and the bending angle of the right side of the workpiece W shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</cross-reference> becomes the greatest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> To correct the difference, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, the feed per stroke of the left vertical cylinder <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L is increased and that of the right vertical cylinder <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R is decreased as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> to thereby increase the left-side speed and decrease the right-side speed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B, 13C</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D, the bending angles at the respective positions are made equal to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, if the workpiece W is bent in the central portion thereof without offset, then the upper and lower tables <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L are deflected by a reactive force from the workpiece W during the bending and the bending angle of the central portion shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference> becomes smaller than those of the left and right sides shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14B and 14D</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To correct the difference, the feed per stroke of the crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is increased to increase the feed per stroke in the central portion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, thereby making the bending angles equal to one another as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15B, 15C</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when history control starts based on the above-stated concept(in a step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), it is determined whether or not the position of the workpiece W is the target position (in a step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). If the position is the target position, the bending is ended (in a step SE). If not the target position, bending speeds at the left and right displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are calculated by the bending speed calculation section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Namely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> bending speed S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the position of the RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained as S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/t. In the expression, L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represents a stroke quantity and t represents time. Likewise, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> bending speed S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the position of the RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be obtained as S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/t. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, a corrected quantity delta S is calculated so that each of the axial speeds of the left and right vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R becomes to equal to S&equals;(S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2 by the uniform speed arithmetic operation section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). As in the case of the positions of the left and right displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a bending speed at the position of the central displacement gauge RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is calculated by the bending speed calculation section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> and compared with the corrected bending speed stated above (in a step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). If the corrected bending speed S is faster, the axial speed of the crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is increased so that the bending speed S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the position of the displacement gauge RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes equal to the corrected bending speed S in response to the instruction of the stroke instruction section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and the processing returns to the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to repeat the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> To increase the axial speed of the crowning cylinder, CC% is increased and crowning cylinder pressure is set according to (Crowning cylinder pressure)&equals;(Pressures of left and right vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R)&times;CC%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if it is determined in the step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that the corrected bending speed S is not faster than the bending speed S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the position of the intermediate displacement gauge RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, then it is further determined whether or not the bending speed S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the position of the displacement gauge RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is faster than the corrected bending speed S (in a step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). If the bending speed S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is faster than the corrected bending speed S, CC% is decreased and the axial speed of the crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is decreased so that the bending speed S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes equal to the bending speed S, in response to the instruction of the stroke instruction section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). The processing returns to the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the following are repeated. Further, if it is determined in the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that the corrected bending speed S is not faster than the bending speed S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the processing returns to the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the following are repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As a result of the above, the bending speeds at the positions of the respective displacement gauges RDC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RDC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RDC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> become uniform, so that it is possible to improve workpiece passage accuracy in the longitudinal direction of the punch P and the die D and to perform bending with high accuracy. It is noted that this invention is not limited to the embodiment of the invention but can be appropriately changed to make it possible to carry out the invention in another modes.

However, a press brake for vertically moving the upper table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>U to which the punch P is attached is also available exactly in the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the above embodiment, description has been given to a case of employing the left and right vertical cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>R as the left and right driving shafts. Alternatively, a motor and a ball spring can be employed. Further, in the above embodiment, description has been given to a case of providing the crowning cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at the center of the lower table <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L as a driving shaft other than the left and right driving shafts.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Since the robot <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is already well known, it will not be described in detail but described herein only schematically. In this robot <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, a first movable carriage <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is provided movably in the X-axis direction along the base plate <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> used in the third embodiment, a plurality of displacement gauges <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> which detect the lower end of the workpiece W are provided in the die D in the longitudinal direction of the die D.

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the workpiece W which is pressed and bent by the punch P presses the detection pin <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> downward, the upper and lower positions of the detection pin <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> at this time are detected by the linear scale <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the distance between the upper end portion of the detection pin <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the die D is obtained as an inter-blade distance ST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, a</cross-reference> bending and robot operation program arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> which creates a program for the bending operation of the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> based on CAD information and creates a program for the workpiece support operation of the robot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is connected to the controller <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. In addition, the controller <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is provided with a press brake controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> which controls the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and a robot controller <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> which controls the robot <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and controls the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the robot <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in accordance with the programs created by the bending and robot operation program arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Displacement gauges <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> are connected to the press brake controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and the controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> includes a stroke position and speed arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> which calculates the upper and lower positions (ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>) of the punch P and the moving speed thereof from signals from the displacement gauges <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. The bending speed of the workpiece W is calculated from the relative position and speed of the punch P calculated by the stroke position and speed arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the robot controller <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the controller <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> includes a displacement gauge selection means <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> which selects the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> closest to the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> connected either through the press brake controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> or directly to the robot controller <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, a follow-up locus and speed arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> which receives signals for the relative positions, bending speed and the like of the punch P calculated by the stroke position and speed arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight>, which calculates the follow-up locus (X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) or (X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the workpiece damper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> and the follow-up speed thereof, and a robot driving instruction information providing means <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> which distributes an instruction pulse to the Z axis, Y axis, A axis and B axis and instructs axis motors MZ, MY and MA and MB which serve as shaft driving means to control the motors MZ, MY, MA and MB so that the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> moves at a follow-up speed along the follow-up locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Next, a bending method according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Before bending, based on graphic information, such as a development view and a three-dimensional view, from the CAD (in a step S<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>), the robot operation program including a workpiece bending order, the determination of a die, the workpiece clamper position and workpiece installation attitude and the like for the workpiece clamper, is created in advance (in a step S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Bending starts (in a step S<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>), and the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> closest to the workpiece damper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> in the X axis direction is selected from among a plurality of displacement gauges <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> which are provided in the longitudinal direction of the die D, by the displacement gauge selection means <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The press brake controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> distributes a D-axis pulse to control the left and right vertical cylinders, for example, ascending and descending the lower table <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>L (in a step S<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>), moves the D axis (in a step S<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>), and allows the stroke position and speed arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> to detect a bending speed from the detection pin <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> of the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>). The press brake controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> then determines whether or not the distance between the punch and the die reaches a target value (in a step S<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). If the distance does not reach the target value yet, the controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> returns to the step S<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and repeats the step S<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and the following. If the distance reaches the target value, the press brake controller <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> ends controlling the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the robot controller <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> starts following up the workpiece W in accordance with the operation of the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>), detects a bending speed from the position of the detection pin <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> of the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> previously selected by the displacement gauge selection means <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) and allows the follow-up locus and speed arithmetic operation means <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> to calculate the follow-up position of the workpiece damper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> and thereby calculates the follow-up speed (in a step S<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> To move the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> at the follow-up speed from this follow-up position, an instruction pulse is distributed to the robot axes (Z axis, Y axis, A axis and B axis) in response to the instruction of the robot driving instruction information providing means <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> (in a step S<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>), the motors MZ, MY, MA and MB which serve as respective shaft driving means are actuated to move the robot axes (in a step S<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>). If the distance between the die and the punch reaches the target value by the processing of the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the follow-up of the workpiece W is ended (in a step S<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>) and the bending is ended (in a step SE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As a result of the above, since the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> obtains the bending speed, spring position and spring speed and the like of the workpiece W, it is possible to more accurately obtain the follow-up locus of the workpiece damper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> based on the actual behavior of the workpiece W. Further, since the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> can follow up the workpiece W in accordance with the actual bending speed of the workpiece W, it is possible to prevent the buckling of the workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the workpiece W follow-up speed is obtained based on descending speed and speed information from the displacement gauge <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> closest to the workpiece clamper <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> during offset bending, it is possible to highly accurately obtain the follow-up position and follow-up speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments of the invention stated so far but can be carried out in the other modes by making appropriate changes to the invention. Namely, in the above-stated embodiments, the press brake <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> having the lower table <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>L ascending and descending has been described. However, a press brake of such a type as to ascend and descend the upper table <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>U is also available exactly in the same manner. </paragraph>
