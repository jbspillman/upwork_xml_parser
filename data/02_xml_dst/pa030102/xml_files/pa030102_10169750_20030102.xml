<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing processes of a circuit board, after forming circuit wirings on a board, it is required to inspect the presence of a disconnection or open circuit in the circuit wirings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, an open circuit state in circuit wirings on a circuit board has been determined by bringing a pair of pins into contact with two different portions of each circuit wiring and then checking conduction between the positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, in an area of the circuit board, such as the vicinity of an integrated circuit, where the circuit wirings are formed in close proximity to each other, it is difficult to assure a sufficient interval between the pins. On the other hand, a non-contact type inspection method (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 09-264919) has been proposed. However, since this inspection method has still been required to bring one pin into contact with each input section of the circuit wirings, it has been suffered from complicated and time-consuming positioning operations when circuit wirings such as those around an integrated circuit are in close proximity to each other and each of the circuit wirings has a short length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In view of the problems in the above conventional methods, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method capable of inspecting a circuit board at a high speed. </paragraph>

Therefore, the present invention is not limited to any arrangement, numerical values and others of elements or components described in this embodiment unless otherwise specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As one embodiment of the present invention, a system for inspecting a circuit board incorporating an integrated circuit will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> &lt;Construction of Inspection System&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is schematic diagram showing the inspection system in an inspection operation of a circuit board <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display (LCD) driver module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as an object to be inspection has an onboard LCD driving LSI <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A plurality of first circuit wirings <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;SEG circuit-wiring group&rdquo;) printed on the circuit board are connected to a plurality of segment (SEG) terminals of the LSI <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, respectively. A plurality of second circuit wirings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;COM circuit-wiring group&rdquo;) are connected to a plurality of common (COM) terminals of the LSI <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, respectively. Further, a plurality of third circuit wirings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are connected to a plurality of input terminals of the LSI <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The inspection system comprises an inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> composed of a computer, an SEG sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a COM sensor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a general-purpose computer incorporating an LCD driving program, a circuit and program for analyzing a detected signal from each of the sensors, an interface for allowing communication between the sensors and the LCD driver module, and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates an LSI drive signal and sends it to the input terminals <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the LSI <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Voltage changes in each of the SEG and COM circuit-wiring groups <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> caused by the LSI drive signal are detected by the sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and then the signals detected by the sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are analyzed in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are positioned opposedly to the SEG and COM circuit-wiring groups <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, respectively, in a non-contact manner. The sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> detect the voltage changes in the SEG and COM circuit-wiring groups <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> caused by driving the LSI <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and sends them to the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as detected signals. While the distance between each of the sensors and the corresponding circuit-wiring group is desired to be 0.05 mm or less, the voltage changes can be detected as long as the distance is set in 0.5 mm or less. The sensors may be closely placed on the circuit board with interposing a dielectric insulating material therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an equivalent circuit showing the relationship of one of the sensors, the LSI and the corresponding circuit-wiring group. As illustrated, it can be assumed that the sensor is connected with the LSI through a plurality of capacitive couplings. Thus, pulse waves from the LSI are converted into differential waves on a side of the sensor, and then these differential waves are received by the sensor as a detected signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the internal construction of the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the hardware of the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The reference numeral <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> indicates a power supply for supplying a power to the entire inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> indicating a CPU for performing various operations and controlling the entire inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the reference numeral <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> indicating a ROM for storing programs executed in the CPU <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, fixed values or the like, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> indicating a RAM as a temporary memory. The RAM includes a program loading area for storing loaded programs, a memory area for digital signals received from the sensors, and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The reference numeral <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> indicates a hard disk (HD) as an external memory. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> indicates a CD-ROM drive as a read device for a detachable storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The reference numeral <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> indicates an input/output interface. The inspection apparatus sends and receives signals to/from a keyboard <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> as an input device, a mouse <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and a monitor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> through the input/output interface <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A jig <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> sends signals to the LCD driver module as a work, and switches the SEG sensor and the COM sensor. The computer as the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is expanded to have compatibility for inspecting the LCD driver module, and an interface card <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and an A/D conversion board <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> are incorporated therein. The interface card <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> contains an amplifier <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, the detected signal from each of the sensors is amplified by the amplifier, and then sent to the A/D conversion board <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The interface card <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> further includes a power supply <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for jig controls. This is a booster operable to vary its supply voltage when the work includes a short circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Various programs such as an LCD-driver control program, jig control program and detected signal analysis program are stored in the HD <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and each program is loaded on the program loading area of the RAM <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and executed. An image data (CAD data) representing each shape of circuit wirings in design is also stored in the HD <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The LCD and/or jig control programs may be installed by reading a CD-ROM with the CD-ROM drive. Otherwise, these programs may be read from other medium such as a FD or DVD, or may be downloaded via networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Each of the sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made of a conductive material including metals such as aluminum or copper, and semiconductors. Preferably, each of the sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a dimension capable of covering all of the circuit wirings or the circuit-wiring groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one mode in which the single inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the single jig to inspect the single work, a plurality of interface cards may be incorporated in a single inspection apparatus to simultaneously inspect a plurality of works. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> method for detecting defects in the SEG circuit-wiring group will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The LSI is forcedly driven so that its 1st to N-th terminals provide output pulse signals as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Each point designated by the arrows X and Y is the timing for switching frames, and each of the output waveforms from the terminals is reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The pulse signals as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are detected by the sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and differentiated and added. The resulting sum forms a waveform as a detected signal having a shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As illustrated, at the timings X, Y for switching frames, each voltage in all of the terminals raises or turns down simultaneously to generate a relatively high peak periodically. One frame period of time can be determined by detecting these adjacent frame-switching points and counting the lapsed time between the two points. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), by checking the output signal of the sensor around a value n L/N derived from dividing the frame time L by the number of the terminals N and multiplying the resulting quotient by a positive integer n, where n is equal to or less than the number of the terminals N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, despite of existence of an output pulse signal from the 3rd terminal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), no deferential waveform is detected in the sensor output or detected signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Thus, it can be determined that the circuit wiring connected to the 3rd terminal includes a disconnection, and thereby no voltage change is caused at the corresponding position of the sensor. Further, if some circuit wirings include a short circuit therebetween, voltage in the booster circuit is varied by driving the terminal connected to this circuit wiring, and then voltage changes are caused in all of the terminals. This leads to a significant disorder in the sensor output waveform. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows that the two circuit wirings connected to the N&minus;1-th and N&minus;2-th terminals are short-circuited mutually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> method for detecting defects in the COM circuit-wiring group will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Differently from the SEG terminals, the COM terminals are turned on and off in a sequential order during a regular LCD drive. Thus, the COM terminals are driven in the ordinary way without any additional particular control. However, by the ordinary way, the timing of turn-off in one of the terminals is simultaneous with the timing of turn-on in adjacent one, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Thus, if no defect, at any one of the timing, the differential value representing a voltage change in one of the circuit wirings has the same magnitude as but the reverse sign to that in adjacent one. That is, in a normal state free from any defect, the sensor output waveform formed by adding respective differential values of all of the terminals will have a flat shape. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), only if one circuit wiring in the circuit group includes a disconnection, two circuit wirings connected to the terminals on both sides of the terminal of the circuit wiring including the disconnection have turn-on and turn-off waveforms, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As in the SEG terminals, a relatively high peak is generated at each of the frame switching timings X and Y. Further, disconnection and short circuit in the circuit wiring connected to the n-th COM terminal can be detected based on the frame time L and the number of the terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Fir example, in the sensor output as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a differential waveform is detected at the 4th position in the divided times. That is, it can be determined that the circuit wiring connected to the 4th terminal includes a disconnection, and thereby no voltage change is caused at the corresponding position of the sensor. Further, the waveform of a short circuit is the same as that in the SEG terminals. That is, if one circuit wiring in the circuit-wiring group includes a short circuit, voltage in the booster circuit is varied by driving the terminal connected to this circuit wiring, and then voltage changes are caused in all of the terminals. This leads to a significant disorder in the sensor output waveform. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows that the two circuit wirings connected to the N&minus;1-th and N&minus;2-th terminals are short-circuited mutually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> With reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the processing flow in the inspection operation will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In Step S-<highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, each position of frame inversions on a time axis is first detected. This can be achieved by detecting peaks each appears approximately periodically and equal to or greater than a given value. In Step S-<highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the period of time between the peaks of the frame inversions is then measured to determine a frame time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In Step S-<highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, L/N is derived from dividing the frame time L by the number of the terminals N. After initializing the terminal number n in Step S-<highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, n is incremented in Step S-<highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, and n L/N is calculated to specify a range on the time axis in which the voltage of the circuit wiring connected to the n-th terminals is to be detected. By comparing the sensor output waveform falling within in the range to a normal sensor output waveform or comparing a threshold derived from the normal sensor output waveform to a peak of the actual output, it is detected whether voltage change is caused in the n-th circuit wiring. More specifically, in the inspection operation of the SEG circuit-wiring group, when the peak of the actual output is equal to or less than a certain threshold, it is determined that the circuit wiring includes a disconnection. Further, when the peak of the actual output is equal to or less than another threshold, it is determined that the circuit wiring includes a short circuit. In the inspection operation of the COM circuit-wiring group, when the peak of the actual output is equal to or greater than a certain threshold, it is determined that the circuit wiring includes a disconnection. Further, when the peak of the actual output is equal to or greater than another threshold greater than the certain threshold, it is determined that the circuit wiring include a short circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If one of disconnection and short circuit is determined in Step S-<highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the process proceeds from Step S-<highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> to Step S-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, and the circuit wiring number n and its determined defect are recorded. In Step S-<highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>, n is then compared to N in order to determine if the inspection operation for the entire circuit-wiring groups is completed. If n is less than N, the process returns to Step S-<highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. After n is incremented, the processing in Step S-<highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to Step S-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> will be repeated. When n is equal to N, the completion of the inspection operation for the entire circuit-wiring groups is determined, and the processing is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When it is required to remove a defective circuit board even if only one defect is included in circuit wirings of the circuit board, in response to YES in Step S-<highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, the defect of the circuit board is notified to a user, and then the processing of this circuit board may be terminated without completing the inspection operation for the entire circuit-wiring groups. Otherwise, without the storing process in Step S-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the defect of the circuit board may be simply notified to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As above, in the inspection system according to this embodiment, disconnection and/or short circuit in the circuit board having the onboard LCD driving LSI as an integrated circuit are detected in a non-contact manner. Thus, even if highly fine circuit patterns are introduced in the market, it is unnecessary to prepare mechanisms and spend much time for troublesome positioning operations. Further, the jig is not damaged and desired automatic mechanization can be facilitated because any probe is not used in the inspection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inspection system according to this embodiment can inspect a circuit board having an onboard LSI. In the same state, the LSI itself can also be inspected (an inspection of current consumption during operation, an inspection and measurement of voltage, an inspection of frame frequency or the like), and thereby the time for inspecting the entire LSD driver module can be remarkably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> While the inspection system according to this embodiment detects voltage changes in the circuit wirings, the quantity and radiative configuration of an electromagnetic wave emitted from the circuit board may be detected. When the electromagnetic wave has a given quantity and configuration, it is determined that the circuit wiring has a normal continuity. If the electromagnetic wave has a quantity less than a give value and a configuration different from a given criterion, it is determined that the circuit wiring has a defect. </paragraph>
