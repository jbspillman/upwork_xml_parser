<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an evaporator for a refrigerating system which refrigerates an object to be cooled (e.g., water, brine, etc.) by exchanging heat between the object and the refrigerant, and a refrigeration apparatus using the evaporator. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Background Art </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a structure of large scale, such as a tall building, cool water, which has been chilled by a refrigerating system, is circulated through a pipe arrangement disposed in the structure so that heat is exchanged between the cool water circulating in the pipe arrangement and air present in the spaces of the structure to decrease the temperature of the spaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example of a conventional evaporator which may be provided with a refrigerator. In this evaporator, a plurality of bundles of heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through which water passes is disposed in a staggered form in a cylindrical container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into which a refrigerant is introduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The plurality of heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be divided into two groups, namely, a group of entering tubes which communicate with a water entrance <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a group of exiting tubes which communicate with a water exit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Water enters from the water entrance <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, passes through heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the entering tube group in the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to reach a water chamber (not shown in the figure), and then passes through the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the exiting tube group to exit from the water exit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. During this process, water is cooled down by heat exchange with the refrigerant introduced into the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the refrigerant which received heat from the water, in turn, boils and vaporizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The vaporized refrigerant is then compressed in a compressor, which is not shown in the figure, and transferred to a condenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned type of evaporator, however, when the refrigerant is boiled around the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and vapor is generated, droplets of the refrigerant are often blown upwards by the force of the refrigerant vapor. Then, some of these droplets of refrigerant are sometimes drawn into the above-mentioned compressor and cause problems, such as a decrease in the performance of the compressor or damage to an impeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although attempts have been made to create open passages (i.e., spaces among heat exchanger tubes) along the bundle of the heat exchanger tubes in an up-and-down direction as pathways for bubbles generated when the refrigerant boils, the force of the refrigerant vapor blown upwards from the opening of the passages is increased in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide an evaporator for a refrigerating system, which is capable of preventing blown upwards of droplets of the refrigerant, and a refrigeration apparatus using the evaporator. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an evaporator for a refrigerating system including a container into which a refrigerant is introduced, and heat exchanger tubes disposed in the container through which an object to be cooled down flows, comprising: a prevention plate disposed above the heat exchanger tubes so that droplets of the refrigerant, which are blown upwards due to boiling of the refrigerant, hit the prevention plate and are prevented from proceeding beyond the prevention plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the heat exchanger tubes are divided into a plurality of vertically spaced groups so that a space is formed between the groups of the heat exchanger tubes in vertical direction; and the prevention plate is disposed above the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the distance between the prevention plate and the heat exchanger tubes at an uppermost level is about 0.5 to 2 times the diameter of a heat exchanger tube which is located at the uppermost level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the prevention plate has a cross section shaped like an inverted letter &ldquo;V&rdquo;, &ldquo;U&rdquo;, &ldquo;W&rdquo;, etc., and the angle of the prevention plate is designed to be between about 60&deg; and 120&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, an end portion of the prevention plate covers at least a part, preferably, half or all, of a heat exchanger tube which is located at the uppermost level of the heat exchanger tubes and is adjacent to the prevention plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, a group of the heat exchanger tubes facing an inner surface of the container is disposed so that a space is formed between the group of the heat exchanger tubes and the container along the inner surface of the container; and a prevention plate is disposed above the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a refrigeration apparatus, comprising: a compressor for compressing a refrigerant; a condenser for condensing and liquefying the refrigerant which is compressed in the compressor; a throttling mechanism for reducing the pressure of the liquefied refrigerant; and an evaporator for cooling down an object to be cooled by exchanging heat between the object to be cooled and a resultant condensed and pressure-reduced liquefied refrigerant, and evaporating and vaporizing the liquefied refrigerant, wherein the evaporator is one of the above-mentioned evaporators. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The evaporator for a refrigerating system according to embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a schematic structure of a refrigerating system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The refrigerating system includes a condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an expansion valve (throttle valve) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a compressor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> condenses and liquefies a refrigerant by exchanging heat between cooling water (the cooled object) and the refrigerant which may be in a vapor phase. The expansion valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> decreases the pressure of the condensed refrigerant. The evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> refrigerates the cooling water by exchanging heat between the cooling water and the condensed refrigerant. The compressor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> compresses the refrigerant, which has been evaporated and vaporized in the evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and supplies it to the above-mentioned condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cooling water refrigerated in the evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be utilized, for instance, for air-conditioning in a building. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a cross-sectional view of the refrigerating system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> cut along the II - II line indicated by arrows. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into which a refrigerant is introduced, and a plurality of bundles of heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> disposed in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The plurality of heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is disposed in the longitudinal direction (i.e., a vertical direction with respect to the sheet surface of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and function as pathways for cooling water, which is the cooled object. The heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are divided into groups, namely, a group of entering tubes which communicate with a cooling water entrance <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a group of exiting tubes which communicate with a cooling water exit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The direction of the flow of cooling water in the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> communicating with the cooling water entrance <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is different from the direction of the flow of cooling water in the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> communicating with the cooling water exit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The plurality of heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be divided into a plurality of groups, for instance, four, (i.e., groups of tubes A-D as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in the lower half of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A space <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed between each of the groups A-D of the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in a vertical direction, and a space <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed between the group A and the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the inner surface of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and between the group D and the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the inner surface of the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Note that the above-mentioned spaces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are hereinafter referred to as passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> since it may be regarded that they are formed by extracting the corresponding heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which may be present there originally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A prevention plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having an inverted &ldquo;V&rdquo; cross sectional shape is disposed above each of the passage <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Also, a blow-up prevention plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may have a flat shape, is disposed above each of the passage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shape of the prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not particularly limited, and any suitable shape, such as inverted &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;W&rdquo;, can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in the enlarged view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vertical angle &thgr; of the prevention plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is designed to be between about 60&deg; and 120&deg;. The prevention plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is disposed at a position above the passage <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that the right and left portions, respectively, of the prevention plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> cover at least a part, preferably, half or all, of the corresponding adjacent heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the uppermost level, and that the distance between the right and left edge portions, respectively, of the prevention plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the corresponding heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> be 0.5 to 2 times the diameter D of the heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as shown in the enlarged view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the prevention plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed above the heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so that the edge portion thereof covers at least a part of the corresponding adjacent heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the uppermost level, and that the distance between the edge portion of the prevention plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the corresponding heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> be 0.5 to 2 times the diameter D of the heat exchanger tube <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Note that although the end portion of the prevention plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is downwardly bent in order to stop the upward flow from the passage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment, the prevention plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have a flat shape and no problems would be caused by the use of such a prevention plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The number of the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contained in the groups A-D in the above embodiment may be chosen to be, for instance, five hundreds. Also, the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in each of the groups A-D may be arranged in a staggered manner. That is, the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at an upper level are shifted by about half of the distance, i.e., &frac12; offset, between each other in the transverse direction with respect to the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the next lower level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the above-mentioned configuration, the refrigerant is introduced into the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a lower portion thereof. Since the refrigerant boils when heat is exchanged between cooling water flowing through the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and itself, vapor of the refrigerant is generated around the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which are mainly located at a lower portion of each of the groups A-D, and rises to the surface through the passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although the vapor and droplets of refrigerant bubbles up vigorously from the opening of the passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the ascent rate thereof is significantly reduced when the vapor and droplets hit the above-mentioned prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As a result, only the vapor of the evaporated refrigerant exits the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the demister <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. That is, it becomes possible to prevent the droplets of refrigerant from being supplied to the compressor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Note that the above-mentioned vapor of the refrigerant is supplied to the compressor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the evaporator of this embodiment of the present invention, since the prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> prevent the droplets of refrigerant being blown upwards beyond the plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the droplets of refrigerant are not drawn into the compressor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it becomes possible to avoid problems, such as a decrease in the performance of the compressor or damage to an impeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Note that although the prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed only above the passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the above-mentioned embodiments, droplets of refrigerant may sometimes be blown upwards by bubbles of the refrigerant which ascend between the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in each of the groups A-D. Accordingly, the prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be disposed so as to cover all of the heat exchanger tubes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the groups A-D as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this manner, it becomes possible to assuredly prevent the droplets of refrigerant from entering the compressor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, although each of the prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is disposed so as to be vertically shifted relative to each other and to overlap, when viewed from the above, with adjacent prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is possible to arrange the prevention plates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in a different manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Also, although the passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided in order to decrease the amount of bubbles in each of the tube groups A-D in the evaporator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according the above-mentioned embodiments, the present invention, which can prevent the droplets of refrigerant from blowing upwards, may also be effectively and suitably applied to an evaporator having no passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to the evaporator of the present invention, since the prevention plates are disposed above the heat exchanger tubes so that droplets of refrigerant, which are blown upwards when the refrigerant is boiled, hit the prevention plates, the droplets of refrigerant are not drawn into the compressor. Accordingly, it becomes possible to avoid problems caused by the droplets, such as a decrease in the performance of the compressor or damage to an impeller. </paragraph>
