<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an automatic water supply system for automatically supplying water to an object of water supply such as soil in a planting facility of, for example, pots or planting mats, mainly relates to an automatic water supply system for detecting presence or absence of water of an object of water supply and automatically supplying water based on a result thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, in a planting facility by, for example, pots or planting mats, as a technology with regard to supplying water to an object of water supply such as soil, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 17054/1990, there are pots for detecting a content of water in soil by electric resistance between opposed electrodes and provided with a lamp or a buzzer for informing start of water supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, when a person for supplying water is absent for a long period of time, the informing by a lamp or a buzzer cannot contribute to water supply at all and therefore, there is brought about a drawback that even when the pots are used, the plant is killed. Further, according to the pots, there is not disclosed with regard to a special water supply method or the like at all, water is supplied artificially in accordance with informing by the informing means and therefore, there is also brought about a drawback that in the case of a wide planting area, there is needed enormously laborious water supply operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to resolve the above-described drawbacks, there have been proposed an automatic water supply system for automatically supplying water at previously determined intervals of time as shown by, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 16257/1987, an apparatus of detecting an amount of water in soil and supplying water automatically in accordance with a result of detection as shown by, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 4862/1993, and an automatic water supply system of mounting a pot in a water supply tank, detecting an upper limit and a lower limit state of water in the water supply tank and starting to supply water after elapse of a constant time period after water reaches a lower limit value as shown in, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 74359/1986 and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, also in the above-described automatic water supply systems, no consideration is given at all to a state of a plant which is to constitute a basis of determination of necessity and unnecessity of water supply and water is supplied by the same processing for all of plants having time which needs much water and time which hardly needs water. Therefore, when the water supply processing is set to adapt to, for example, time which needs much water, a large amount of water is supplied at time which hardly needs water, such a large amount of water causes root rot and therefore, there is brought about a drawback that the plant is finally killed. Further, since extra water is supplied, there is also brought about a drawback that water cost becomes enormous. Conversely, when the water supply processing is set to adapt to time which hardly needs water, water is hardly supplied at time which needs much water, as a result, there is brought about a drawback that the plant is killed as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As the above-described time which needs much water, for example, there is time immediately after mounting cut turf or the like on soil in a planting facility of mounting the cut turf on the soil. Immediately after mounting cut turf on soil, there is brought about a state in which the root of lawn does not adapt to soil and does not take root deep into the soil, an air layer is formed between the root of the cut turf and the soil, which is a state in which the turf is the weakest. Therefore, this is time having high possibility of killing plant since water is deficient and much water is needed for making the lawn take root deep into the soil fastly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Conversely, as time which hardly needs water, for example, there is time in which the cut turf takes root deep into the soil in the planting facility of mounting the cut turf on the soil. After the cut turf takes root deep into the soil in the planting facility of mounting the cut turf on the soil. After the cut turf takes root deep into the soil, there is brought about a state of strong water absorption power and therefore, it is preferable to grow plant in a state as near to the nature as possible, which is time having high possibility of causing root rot or growing poor turf by excessive water supply. Further, in order to grow a robust plant, it is significant to give constant water stress and it is not necessary to supply so much water in such a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to resolve the above-described drawback in consideration of a state of a plant, there is a technology disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 313675/1998. According thereto, seeds of lawn or lawn at an initial stage of growing is planted in artificial soil, a water level at inside of the artificial soil is maintained to a high water level and successively the water level is lowered in accordance with growth of root of the lawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, according to the technology of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 313675/1998, the water level is not controlled automatically in accordance with a state of the plant but a state of growing root of lawn is confirmed by optical observation and therefore, it is necessary to monitor the state of the turf from time to time, further, the water level is adjusted artificially and there is brought about a drawback that water supply administration becomes troublesome. Further, the artificial soil is maintained in a state of always being immersed in water and therefore, grown turf can also absorb water from time to time, as a result, poor turf is constituted. Further, according to the constitution of adjusting the water level such that the artificial soil is immersed always in water, it is necessary to supply water even at time which does not need water so much and there is brought about a drawback that the water cost becomes expensive. </paragraph>

For example, the automatic water supply system includes the water content sensor for detecting presence or absence of water of the object of water supply, and control means for controlling operation of the water supply means in accordance with a measured value of the water content sensor, and the control means includes the first timer portion for measuring the first predetermined time period in accordance with input of a result of detection of absence of water by the water content sensor to the control means, when a predetermined amount of water is not detected by the water content sensor during a time period until finishing to measure the first predetermined time period by the first timer portion, a water supply start signal is outputted to the water supply means and the predetermined amount of water is detected by the water content sensor during the time period until finishing to measure the first predetermined time period by the first timer portion, at least the first timer portion of the control means is initialized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, an automatic water supply system according to the invention is characterized in an automatic water supply system comprising water supply means capable of supplying water to an object of water supply and control means set with a plurality of kinds of modes at least having different conditions of starting to supply water for controlling to carry out to supply water and stop to supply water by the water supply means in accordance with the modes, wherein the modes are switched in accordance with a predetermined switching condition. Further, the object of water supply is constituted by inside of a plant cultivating article of, for example, inside of a plant, soil, a water storage tray or the like, further, a portion of detecting a water content state, mentioned later, is constituted by inside of a plant cultivating article of, for example, inside of a plant, soil, a water storage tray or the like, further, a water supply portion and a water content detecting portion can be made to be the same as each other or different from each other as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, the automatic water supply system is characterized in that simultaneously with detecting sufficiency of water by the water content sensor simultaneously with starting to supply water or after starting to supply water, a second predetermined time period is measured by a second timer portion and after elapse of the second predetermined time period, water supply is stopped. For example, the second timer portion is provided at the control means, the second timer portion measures the second predetermined time period simultaneously with outputting a water supply start signal and outputting a water supply stop signal to the water supply means after measuring the second predetermined time period of the second timer portion, or the second timer portion detects water content by the water content sensor after outputting the water supply start signal and measures the second predetermined time period and outputs the water supply stop signal to the water supply means after measuring the second predetermined time period of the second timer portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, the automatic water supply system is characterized in that a flow rate meter is installed at a water path of the water supply means and water is stopped from being supplied when a measured value of the flow rate meter reaches a previously determined flow rate value after starting to supply water. For example, there is constructed a constitution in which the flow rate meter is provided at the water path between the water supply means and the water supply object and the control means outputs the water supply stop signal to the water supply means when the measured value by the flow rate meter reaches the previously determined flow rate value after outputting the water supply start signal. It is preferable to construct a constitution in which a condition of setting the flow rate value can be changed manually or automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, when the water supply object is constituted by a single or a plurality thereof, the automatic water supply system is characterized in that a plurality of the water content sensors are installed at necessary portions for detecting a predetermined number of pieces of the water content sensors each constituting a result of detecting deficiency of water content of the water supply object and the first timer portion measures the first predetermined time period. For example, when there are a plurality of the water supply objects, by installing an arbitrary number of pieces of the water content sensors at arbitrary portions of the plurality of water supply objects and detecting presence or absence of water content based on a previously determined number of pieces of the water content sensors in the arbitrary number of pieces of the installed water content sensors, presence or absence or water content is determined. There may be constructed a constitution in which the previously determined number of pieces of the arbitrary number of pieces of the installed water content sensors, can freely be set. Further preferably, at least two pieces or more of the installed water content sensors are installed at portions having different conditions in the plurality of water supply objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, the automatic water supply system is characterized in that the water supply object is divided into a plurality of blocks, detection of deficiency of water content by the water content sensor is carried out for the respective block and water is supplied to the block in which deficiency of water content is detected. </paragraph>

For example, there is constructed a constitution in which a single or a plurality of the water supply objects are constituted by a plurality of water supply units, and previously divided into a plurality of blocks including one or more of the water supply units and in accordance with a result of detection by the water content sensors of the respective blocks, water supply means can start to supply water and stop to supply water to the blocks in which deficiency of water content is detected, or in accordance with a result of detecting deficiency of water content by the water content sensors from a single or a plurality of blocks, the water supply means starts and stops supplying water to the respective blocks in a previously determined order for a total of the water supply object and further, these are repeatedly carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, in the automatic water supply system there can be constructed a constitution of capable of setting manually or setting automatically at least either or both of the first predetermined time period and the second predetermined time period by a condition, or there can be constructed a constitution in which time is measured by constituting a single timer portion by the first timer portion and the second timer portion or the water content sensor can be constructed by a constitution of detecting presence or absence of water content by electric resistance between at least two conductive members, further, there can be constructed a constitution of capable of manually setting or automatically setting by constituting a condition of an electric resistance value constituting a detection system of the water content sensor in the control means. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> According to the automatic water supply system of the embodiment, water is supplied to a plant cultivating unit of a bottom face irrigation type in which a plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> substantially in a box shape, an upper face of which is opened as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is mounted on a water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. By providing the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a constant amount of water can be stored after water supply or in the case of natural rainfall and therefore, a number of times of water supply can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a box member substantially in a square shape in plane view, an upper face of which is opened, a side face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thereof is formed with an inwardly recessed portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an opening portion thereof is widened toward an upper side. A bottom face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereof is provided with a water absorption projected portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>a top portion of which is bored with a water absorption hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a leg portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>projected downward from the water absorption projected portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a plant <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is planted in a soil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> arranged at an inner portion thereof. The soil is constituted by a soil in which a plant of cut turf of the like is previously planted, or a soil separately filled in the cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may be constituted by a cultivating material other than the soil. When a plurality of the plant cultivating containers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are laid as mentioned later, a space portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed between the inwardly recessed portions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&bull;<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and above the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a wire connecting a water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the like can be interposed in the space portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and an outlook thereof excellent in a beautiful outlook can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the upper face of which is opened, is formed mainly in a taper shape and constituted by a side face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having heights lower than that of the side face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the front cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is arranged above the bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and water <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a water level of <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is stored at an inner portion thereof. Further, the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is provided at inside of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to constitute a water content state detecting portion, because a detected value of the water content state having high accuracy and stability can more preferably be provided as a reference for detecting the water content state of the plant cultivating unit or the like used in operating the automatic water supply system than in the case of providing the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in, for example, the soil or the like, however, the water content state detecting portion can also be constituted by other portion such as soil and there can pertinently be adopted a constitution of providing the sensor in the soil in the case of, for example, a plant cultivating container which does not include the water storage tray or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> According to a state in which the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on the bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an upper end of the side face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed to be lower than the height of the leg portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and therefore, an air layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is necessarily formed between the bottom face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> mounted thereon by the leg portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the water level <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of water stored in the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> even when the water level <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>assumedly becomes an upper limit water level. By the air layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, ventilation can easily be carried out from a water passing and air passing hole, mentioned later, to inside of the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to thereby enable to achieve a root rot preventive effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Further, by the leg portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>more projected than the water absorption projected portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the bottom face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is maintained at a position higher than the top portion of the side face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a space portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed between the top portion of the water absorption projected portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the water storage tank tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. There is constructed a constitution in which water in the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be absorbed from the water absorption hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed at the top portion of the water absorption projected portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the capillary phenomenon to thereby constitute a plant cultivating unit of a so-to-speak bottom face irrigation type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Further, there is constructed a constitution in which the water <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> stored in the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sucked up from the water absorption hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the water <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is supplied to the soil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the plant <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, although omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the bottom face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is bored with, for example, a plurality of holes for discharging water and ventilation, extra water in the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be delivered into the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the holes, air can be delivered from the air layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the soil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the plant cultivating container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and root rot of the plant can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> provided above the bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by a wire via interface I/F, further, the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to an solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for controlling to supply water of the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by a wire via interface I/F and opening/closing of the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is controlled by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supplies the water <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from a water supply source into the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a water supply port disposed at a front end thereof is directed to inside of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, connection between the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as well as the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the automatic water supply system is not limited to connection by wires but can also be made wireless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A detecting portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is arranged with at least two of electrode members (conductive members) at a predetermined interval therebetween for detecting an amount of a water content by a resistance value when electricity is made to flow between the electrode members and when water is present to some degree, the resistance value between the electrode members is reduced. Meanwhile, when the water is reduced, the resistance value between the electrode members is increased since the electrode members are insulated by air. Further, when the resistance value between the electrode members reaches or exceeds a constant value, a state of being deficient in water is detected and when the resistance value reaches or does not exceed the constant value, a state of being sufficient in water is detected to thereby detect presence or absence of water. The determination of detection maybe carried out by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by acquiring a measured value of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Further, it is possible to use a pertinent one of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> capable of detecting a necessary amount of water. Further, in detecting presence or absence of the water content amount, there may be constructed a constitution in which absence of a predetermined amount of water is detected when the resistance value between the electrode members reaches a predetermined reference upper limit resistance value and presence of the predetermined water amount is detected when the resistance value reaches a predetermined reference lower limit resistance value, further, there may be constructed a constitution in which instead of using the same reference resistance values for the reference upper limit resistance value and the reference lower limit resistance value, for example, two of upper limit and lower limit reference resistance values are separately set and used for the reference upper limit resistance value and the reference lower limit reference value and water is supplied after detecting absence of the water content amount until the reference lower limit resistance value is reached. The reference upper limit resistance value and the reference lower limit resistance value can pertinently be changed to set to required values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The constant value can be set to a required value by a setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, mentioned later, for example, when the constant value is set to 600 k&OHgr;, deficiency of water is detected when the set 600 k&OHgr; is reached or exceeded, when water is supplied by supplying water by the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> or rainfall or the like, the resistance value between the electrode members is reduced and when the resistance value becomes smaller than 600 k&OHgr;, sufficiency of water is detected. With respect to the constant value, a constant value for detecting deficiency of water and a constant value for detecting sufficiency of water may be set to be different from each other, for example, may be set to 600 k&OHgr; and 500 k&OHgr;. By such setting, when a predetermined amount of water is not supplied by water supply or rainfall from a water deficient state, a necessary amount of water can firmly be supplied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the embodiment is constituted mainly by connecting the setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a display portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, RAM and ROM for storing required items to CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is connected respectively to the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> via interface I/F connected to CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a portion for setting a necessary content in the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is a portion for setting various values of the constant value comparing with the resistance value of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a first predetermined time period and a second predetermined time period, mentioned later, and the like. The time portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a portion for measuring a predetermined period of time under instruction of CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and includes at least a first timer portion for measuring the first predetermined time period and a second timer portion for measuring the second predetermined time period, mentioned later, according to the embodiment. The display portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is a portion for displaying a required content of an operational situation of the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and is, for example, LED, a liquid crystal screen or the like and by displaying an operational content in the display portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>from time to time, it can be recognized at a glance whether the automatic water supply system is operated normally. Further, the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be provided with informing means for informing an abnormality when detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> supplies water by the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and controls to supply water by the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided at the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The solenoid vale <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is connected to CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> via interface I/F and opening/closing of the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and accordingly, start and stop of water supply by the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is controlled by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of a procedure of carrying out an automatic water supply processing by the automatic water supply system having the above-described constitution. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing processings of the control means and the water supply means in the automatic water supply system, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a time chart when water is supplied by the above-described automatic water supply system and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a time chart when water is not supplied by the above-described automatic water supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> First, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in a state in which CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is initialized (S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>), the detecting portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> measures the resistance value between the electrode members continuously or at respective predetermined time periods and the resistance value constituting a result of detection is inputted from the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to initialized CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>determines whether the resistance value is inputted and when CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>recognizes that the resistance value is inputted, CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>compares the inputted resistance value and the predetermined constant value set by the setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> When the resistance value exceeds the constant value or the resistance value reaches the constant value as a result of comparing the resistance value and the constant value, the first timer portion of the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is operated to start measuring the first predetermined time period (S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>), on the other hand, when the resistance value does not exceed or reach the constant value, comparison between a newly inputted resistance value and the constant value is repeated (S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, during a time period until the first timer portion finishes measuring the first predetermined time period, a newly measured resistance value is inputted from the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a comparison thereof with the constant value is continuously carried out, so far as the respective resistance value exceeds the constant value or the respective resistance value reaches the constant value as a result of comparison between the resistance value inputted in the first predetermined time period and the constant value, measurement of the first predetermined time period and the comparison between a new resistance value and the constant value is continued, when the inputted resistance value does not exceed the constant value or the resistance value doe not reach the constant value, there is carried out a processing in which the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> returns to the initialized state such as stopping the measurement of the first predetermined time period by the first timer portion and the processing is carried out until the measurement of the first predetermined time period is finished (S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Next, when all of the resistance values continuously inputted during the first predetermined time period exceed the constant value or all of the resistance values reach the constant value and measurement of the first predetermined time period is finished (S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), a water supply start signal for bringing the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> into an opened state, is outputted from CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), and the second timer portion of the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>starts measuring the second predetermined time period by control of CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) According to the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, by input of the water supply start signal (S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>), the solenoid value <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is opened and water is started to supply to inside of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> When operation of the second timer portion is finished by finishing measurement of the second predetermined time period (S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>), CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>returns to the initialized state by outputting a water supply stop signal for bringing the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>into a closed state (S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). By input of the water supply stop signal (S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>), the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is brought into the closed state and water is stopped to supply into the water storage tray <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the water supply pipe (S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). The above-described processings are repeatedly carried out automatically and water supply to the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is automatically controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> According to the time chart of the case of supplying water in the above-described processings, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the inputted resistance value is brought into a state of exceeding the constant value, the first timer portion starts operating to be brought into an ON state, measurement of the first predetermined time period is started and after elapse of the first predetermined time period, the first timer portion is brought into an OFF state. Further, simultaneously with bringing the first timer portion into the OFF state, the water supply start signal is instantaneously brought into an ON state to output to thereby bring the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> into an ON state and start to supply water and the second timer portion is brought into an ON state to start to measure the second predetermined time. During measurement of the second predetermined time period, the resistance value measured by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> does not exceed the constant value by supplied water. Next, simultaneously with finishing measurement of the second predetermined time period and bringing the second timer portion into an OFF state, the water supply stop signal is instantaneously brought into an ON state to output and the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is brought into an OFF state to stop supplying water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the time chart in the case of not supplying water, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the inputted resistance value is brought into a state of exceeding the constant value, the first timer portion starts operating to be brought into the ON state and starts to measure the first predetermined time period. Further, during the time period until finishing to measure the first predetermined time period, the resistance value does not exceed the constant value, the first timer portion is brought into the OFF state and measurement is finished. This is a case in which although deficiency of water is temporarily detected, in measuring the first predetermined time period, rainfall or artificial water supply or the like is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> By using the automatic water supply system according to the first embodiment, when the state in which water is deficient is detected by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the first predetermined time period is measured and stress of the first predetermined time period of being deficient in water, can be given to the plant and a robust plant can be cultivated in a state of being as natural as possible. Further, when the state of being deficient in water is resolved by rainfall or the like in measuring the first predetermined time period, water supply can be stopped and root rot can be prevented. Further, stop of water supply and setting and control of the water supply time period by measuring the second predetermined time period by the second timer portion, can be carried out and therefore, it is not necessary to supply extra water and plant cultivating and maintaining cost can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Further, by the constitution of setting both or at least one of the first predetermined time period and the second predetermined time period by the setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a better environment for the plant can be created in accordance with a kind and a location of installing the plant and the environment and desire of the user can be adopted. For example, the first predetermined time period can be set to be long such as one weak or the like and the second predetermined time period can be set to be short such as an hour or the like although depending on a size of the object of water supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Further, although according to the embodiment, there is constructed the constitution of measuring the second predetermined time period and water supply is stopped after elapse of the second predetermined time period, for example, even when there is constructed a constitution in which, for example, a flow rate meter is installed at a water path comprising the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and water supply is stopped when a measured value of the flow rate meter reaches or exceeds a previously determined flow rate value after starting to supply water, the constitution is excellent since the predetermined amount of water supply is firmly carried out. Specifically, a flow rate in the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is summed up based on the measured value of the flow rate meter and water supply is stopped by bringing the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>into the closed state based on a predetermined summed-up flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of a second embodiment of an automatic water supply system according to the invention by centering on a portion thereof different from the first embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> show the second embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing processings of control means and water supply means in the automatic water supply system according to the second embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a time chart when water is supplied by the automatic water supply system and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a time chart when water is not supplied by the automatic water supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Although the automatic water supply system of the embodiment is basically similar to the first embodiment, the automatic water supply system of the embodiment is an embodiment in which time of starting to operate the second timer operation of the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is made to differ. That is, the water supply start signal is outputted by control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), thereafter, the respective resistance value inputted from the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is successively compared with the constant value and when the necessary amount of water is ensured by supplying water and the inputted resistance value does not exceed or does not reach the constant value (S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), that is, it is confirmed that water is supplied firmly and thereafter, the second timer portion starts operating to start measuring the second predetermined time period (S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the time chart, when water is supplied as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, even after the first timer portion is stopped to finish to measure the first predetermined time period, the second timer is not operated, when inputted resistance value does not exceed the constant value, the second timer portion is operated to start measuring the second predetermined time period and there is produced a time lag between time of finishing measurement by the first timer portion and time of starting measurement by the second timer portion. Further, other characteristic of the time charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are similar to those in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> By using the second embodiment, it is possible to prevent beforehand that an amount of supplying water differs by a case in which water remains at inside of the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a case in which water does not remain therein and a necessary amount of water can be supplied firmly into the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. That is, when water does not remain in the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, there is taken a time period until water reaches the object of water supply, conversely, when water remains at inside of the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, although a time period is not taken for water to reach the object of water supply, an error of the water supply amount caused thereby can be eliminated and the water supply amount can be maintained constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of a third embodiment of an automatic water supply system according to the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> show the third embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a system block diagram of the automatic water supply system according to the third embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a document with regard to an automatic water supply system control yearly content by outputting means of the automatic water supply system and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a set content confirmation table by the outputting means of the automatic water supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> According to the automatic water supply system of the embodiment, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in addition to the constitution of the automatic water supply system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a storing portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is connected to CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is further connected to a printer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of outputting means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via interface I/F. Further, although the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the separate outputting means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the outputting means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can also be integrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The storing portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is a portion for storing a control content by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from time to time and is constituted such that for example, when power breakdown is brought about in measuring at the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a measuring situation at the time point is stored and counting can be carried out again from the measuring situation in the power breakdown after recovering power. That is, when power breakdown is brought about in measuring the first predetermined time period, the measuring situation of the first predetermined time period is stored and after recovering power, from the measuring situation, measurement of the first predetermined time period is started and therefore, it can be prevented beforehand that counting of the first predetermined time period is initialized in power breakdown and a time period of not supplying water is prolonged. Further, also with regard to the second predetermined time period, by the above-described constitution, it can be prevented beforehand that a time period of supplying water is prolonged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The printer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outputting means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a portion capable of outputting a content stored to the storing portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, a content set by the setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the like and can output, for example, a document with regard to details of a control content over a year by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and a set content confirmation table for printing out a set content of the automatic water supply system as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The yearly control content document of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is described with date, time and control content, operation until the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is initialized is classified as a single operation and is printed, further, when a set content is automatically or manually changed, date and time of change and content of change thereof are printed and outputted and therefore, it can be recognized over a year whether the automatic water supply system is operated normally. According to the document, for example, the first timer portion starts operating at a.m. 9 o&apos;clock 5 minute of Jan. 14, 1998 and is initialized at p.m. 8 o&apos;clock 34 minute of Jan. 18, 1998 and it is recognized whether rainfalls or water is supplied artificially from around p.m. 8 &apos;clock 30 minute of Jan. 18, 1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown by the set content confirmation table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, two kinds of the first predetermined time period are set, it is set that the first predetermined time period is automatically switched on May 1 and November 1 and the interval of giving stress to the plant is changed by winter and summer. One kind of the second predetermined time period is set. Further, 600 k&OHgr; is set as the resistance value constituting a constant value for comparing with a resistance value acquired by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and when the acquired resistant value is equal to or larger than 600 k&OHgr;, measurement of the first predetermined time period is started. Further, the method of supplying water can be set automatically or manually and when water is intended to supply artificially, by manually setting the method, plant cultivation can be enjoyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> By printing and outputting the set content or the like as described above, even when the set content or the like is forgotten, the set content or the like can instantly be grasped at a glance. Further, by comparing the yearly control content document and the set content confirmation table, it can be grasped whether the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is operated normally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Further, the control content, the set content or the like may be displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Further, layout of the yearly control content document and the set content confirmation table is not limited to those in the above-described embodiment. Further, the print content is not limited thereto but date and time of bringing about abnormality, content of the abnormality or the like may be printed. Further, after all, also the set content is an embodiment and can be set variously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of a fourth embodiment of an automatic water supply system according to the invention. The automatic water supply system according to the fourth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, supplies water to a plurality of the laid water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a total constitution view showing the automatic water supply system, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a system block diagram of the automatic water supply system and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing processings of control means and water supply means in the automatic water supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment is a box member having a substantially square shape in plane view, an upper portion of which is opened and is constructed by a constitution in which an upper end portion of the side face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with respective two pieces of narrow width connecting and engaging portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a wide width connecting and engaging portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having sections substantially in a hook shape and when a plurality of the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are laid to align, the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be laid in a state in which an upper portion of the narrow width connecting and engaging portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of one of the water storage strays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is covered with and connected with the wide width connecting and engaging portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of other of the water storage strays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, there is constructed a constitution in which recessed portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for flowing of water are provided at least at a pair of the connecting portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>opposed to each other substantially at centers of upper ends of the narrow width connecting and engaging portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the wide width connecting and engaging portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a water flow path is formed from an upper side to a lower side by the recessed portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>when the plurality of water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected and water can flow in a constant direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Further, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there is arranged a water supply main pipe <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to a water source of water service, a water storage tank or the like and provided with the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a midway thereof in a longitudinal direction, and there is arranged a water supply branch pipe <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>constituting a porous pipe connected to the water supply main pipe <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>above the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and at an upper position orthogonal to the water flow path. Further, a location of installing the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be disposed on the side of the water supply branch pipe <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to the water supply main pipe <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or may be provided at a vicinity of a portion connecting the both pipes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> By the above-described constitution, water flowing out from the porous portion of the water supply branch pipe <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is supplied to an uppermost one of the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and when water is stored in the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and goes over the recess portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for flowing of water disposed on the lower side, water is supplied successively to the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the lower side and therefore, the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which are not supplied with water can be eliminated. That is, even when there is present a projected portion at a face of laying B, since the water flow path from A is not present in D or G, water from A is firmly supplied to B without detouring D or G and thereafter supplied to C. Therefore, all of the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can firmly be supplied with water. In other words, it is possible to regulate a water flow direction to one direction by the recessed portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and supply water by the porous pipe evenly to all of the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Further, when an arbitrary number of four or the like of pieces of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are provided at arbitrary portions of the plurality of laid water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are connected to the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> via wires and the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When a predetermined number of pieces of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is set as a set value, according to the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, when a number of pieces of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in each of which an acquired resistance value exceeds a constant value, exceeds the set value or equal to or larger than the set value (S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>), the first timer portion is operated to measure the first predetermined time period (S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>), when there is maintained a state in which a number of pieces of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in each of which the acquired resistance value exceeds the constant value, exceeds the set value or equal to or larger than the set value during a time period until finishing to measure the first predetermined time period (S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), the water supply start signal is outputted (S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), and the second timer portion is operated to measure the second predetermined time period (S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). The other constitution is the same as that in the first embodiment. By the above-described constitution, presence or absence of water can accurately be detected and the plant can be cultivated further firmly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Further, the time of operating the second timer portion according to the fourth embodiment may be started simultaneously with when a number of pieces of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in each of which the resistance value acquired after outputting the water supply start signal does not exceed the constant value, reaches a predetermined number of pieces thereof similar to the second embodiment, or there may be constructed also a constitution in which the previously determined number of pieces thereof can be set arbitrarily. Thereby, regardless of presence or absence of water in the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a necessary amount of water can be supplied to the plant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The third predetermined time period and the fourth predetermined time period can also be set by the setting portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and in the case of the time periods of the embodiment, it can be confirmed whether the automatic water supply system is operated normally in 15 minutes and the highly reliable automatic water supply system can be provided to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of an example of applying the automatic water supply system. A constitution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is applicable to all of the above-described embodiments, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a constitution view when a water content sensor mounting base is provided at the water storage tray and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a sectional view enlarging a vicinity of the water content sensor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> According to the example, a water content sensor mounting base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided above the bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is installed above the water content sensor mounting base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at inside of the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The constitution in which the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>installed at the water supply pipe <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, is similar to the above-described and notation <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>designates the water level in the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> By mounting the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> above the mounting base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, erroneous operation of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by influence of dust or dirt brought into the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be prevented beforehand. Further, even when the water storage tray <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is deformed by recesses and projections of a laying face or when the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is accidentally provided at a recessed portion of the recesses and projections of the bottom face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the water storage tray, presence or absence of water can be determined firmly and easily. That is, by providing the mounting base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, when the water level <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is lowered and the water level <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>reaches the mounting base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> mounted with the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the state of being deficient in water can be recognized and therefore, before completely evacuating water, the automatic water supply system can be started to operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Further, by providing the mounting base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, even in the case of a small amount of rainfall, the state of being deficient in water can be recognized.

By selecting the mode, it is determined which of the switching mode or the nonswitching mode is selected (S<highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>) Further, although a system of selecting the mode differs by setting an initial state or the like, there may be constructed also a constitution in which when the nonswitching mode is not selected, the switching mode is carried out automatically and only when the nonswitching mode is selected, the nonswitching mode is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> When the switching mode is selected, a first mode is started (S<highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>) and the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>starts measuring a predetermined switching time period (S<highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>). The switching time period is a time period set as, for example, a predetermined time period for carrying out the switching mode. Further, it is determined whether the switching time period is finished (S<highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>) and during the switching time period, a comparison between the resistance value acquired by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a reference resistance value set to the storing portion of RAM, ROM or the like, is carried out continuously or at predetermined time intervals and when the resistance value of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> reaches the reference resistance value or when the resistance value exceeds the reference resistance value, absence of a necessary water amount is detected, and when the resistance value of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> does not reach the reference resistance value or when the resistance value does not exceed the reference resistance value, presence of the necessary water amount is detected (S<highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

On the other hand, when absence of the necessary water amount is detected, the water supply processing is carried out (S<highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>). The water supply processing is carried out until elapse of, for example, a predetermined water supply time period or until a summed-up flow rate summed up by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> based on, for example, a measured value of the flow rate meter, reaches a predetermined upper limit value. </paragraph>

Further, in the first mode, there can be constructed a constitution in which even in supplying water, presence or absence of the necessary water amount is detected by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and water supply is stopped at a time point at which presence of the necessary water amount is detected, or there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply is stopped at midway by giving a priority to the switching time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> When the second mode is started, determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount is carried out continuously or at predetermined intervals by the resistance value acquired by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>) and when absence of the necessary water amount is detected, measurement of a predetermined stress time period is started by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> During measurement of the stress time period, determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount is carried out continuously or at predetermined intervals based on the resistance value by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>), when presence of the necessary water amount is determined, the stress time period which is being measured by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is initialized (S<highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>) and the operation returns to again to determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount (S<highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>). This is because when the plant cultivating unit is provided outdoors, the water content absent state is switched to the water content present state by rainfall during the stress time period and it is waste of water and is not preferable to supply water after the switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Further, when absence of the necessary water amount is detected during the stress time period, it is determined whether measurement of the stress time period is finished (S<highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>), when measurement of the stress time period is not finished, the operation returns again to determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount (S<highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>) and when measurement of the stress time period is finished and a state of absence of the necessary water amount is maintained during the stress time period, the stress time period measured by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is initialized (S<highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>) and the water supply processing is carried out (S<highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>). The water supply processing is carried out until, for example, elapse of the predetermined water supply time period or until the summed-up flow rate reaches the predetermined upper limit value. When the water supply processing is finished, the operation returns again to determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount (S<highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> An explanation will be given here of the time chart of the embodiment in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, in the total of the system, when the power source of the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is made ON and the switching mode is selected, the first mode is started and measurement of the switching time period is started. When absence of the necessary water amount is detected based on the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> during the first mode, by outputting the water supply start signal, the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> starts supplying water and measurement of the summed-up flow rate or the water supply time period is started. Further, although the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can detect the state of presence of the necessary water amount by arrival of water to the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> after starting to supply water, according to the embodiment, the processing of determining presence or absence of the necessary water amount by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is stopped. Further, when the summed-up flow rate value reaches the upper limit value or when measurement of the water supply time period is finished, the water supply stop signal is outputted and water supply is finished. The above-described is repeatedly carried out during the first mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Further, when measurement of the switching time period is finished, the first mode is switched to the second mode. When absence of the necessary water amount is detected based on the resistance value of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> during the second mode, the predetermined stress time period is measured. When absence of the necessary water amount is not maintained during measurement of the stress time period, the stress time period is initialized (illustration is omitted), and when absence of the necessary water amount by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is maintained, the water supply start signal is outputted, the water supply means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> starts supplying water and measurement of the flow rate by the flow rate meter or measurement of the water supply time period is started. Further, although the state of presence of the necessary water content can be detected by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by arrival of water to the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> after starting to supply water, according to the embodiment, the processing of determining presence or absence of the necessary water amount by the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is stopped.

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> By using the automatic water supply system according to the seventh embodiment, the effectiveness can be achieved in a case described below. For example, when cut turf is used as the plant immediately after constructing the plant cultivating unit at the laying face, the cut turf does not take root deep in the soil, an air layer is formed between the root of the cut turf and the soil and the turf is brought into the weakest state (state easy to be killed). The time period under the state is a time period which needs much water and it is necessary to take root as fast as possible to thereby prevent the turf from being killed. By carrying out the water supply processing at the time period by the first mode of the seventh embodiment, rooting of the turf can be accelerated. Further, according to the turf after having been rooted, by constructing a constitution of automatically switching to the second mode, the turf can be cultivated in a state more proximate to be natural and the robust turf can be cultivated. That is, immediately after constructing the plant cultivating unit, the nonswitching mode is not selected by the switching mode selecting portion and by setting the switching time period to be the second mode after, for example, two weeks by which the turf is likely to take root, the above-described control can be carried out. </paragraph>

When the nonswitching mode is selected, the operation proceeds to A, when the switching mode is selected, the first mode is started (S<highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>), measurement of the predetermined switching time period is started by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>). During a time period until finishing to measure the switching time period, based on detection of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount is repeatedly carried out continuously or at predetermined intervals (S<highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>), the water supply processing is carried out only when absence of the necessary water content is determined (S<highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>). When measurement of the switching time period is finished, the switching time period measured by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is initialized (S<highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> After initializing the switching time period, CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>determines time of the calendar portion and determines the mode based on a result of the determination. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, when time&equals;time <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is determined based on the calendar portion, the operation proceeds to B (S<highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight>), when time&equals;time <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is determined, the operation proceeds to C (S<highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight>) and when time&equals;time <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined, the operation proceeds to D (S<highlight><bold>829</bold></highlight>). Further, in any mode of the respective embodiments, when the nonswitching mode is selected by the switching mode selecting portion, there can be constructed a constitution in which the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> proceeds to the nonswitching mode processing in the predetermined processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> When the operation proceeds to A, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, the second mode is started (S<highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>), when the second mode is started, based on detection of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount is carried out continuously or at predetermined intervals (S<highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>), when absence of the necessary water amount is detected, measurement of the predetermined stress time period is started by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>). Even in measuring the stress time period, determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount is carried out continuously or at predetermined intervals (S<highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>), when presence of the predetermined water amount is determined, the stress time period which is being measured by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is initialized (S<highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>), and the operation returns again to determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount (S<highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>). When absence of the necessary water amount is maintained during the stress time period (S<highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>), the stress time period measured by the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is initialized (S<highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>), and the water supply processing is carried out (S<highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>). The water supply processing is carried out until elapse of, for example, predetermined water supply time period or until the summed-up flow rate by measurement of the flow rate meter reaches a predetermined upper limit value and after finishing the water supply processing, the operation returns again to determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount (S<highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> After the operation proceeds to B, there is started the first mode modified as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> (S<highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>), it is confirmed from time to time whether time is changed by the calendar portion (S<highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight>), when the time is not changed, based on detection of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, presence or absence of the necessary water amount is determined (S<highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>), and only when a result of determining absence of the necessary water amount is provided, the water supply processing is carried out (S<highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, when the time is changed by the calendar portion, in the case of time&equals;time <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the calendar portion, the operation proceeds to C (S<highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight>) and in the case of time&equals;time <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the operation proceeds to D (S<highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> After the operation proceeds to C, there is started the second mode modified as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> (S<highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight>), it is confirmed from time to time whether the time is changed by the calendar portion (S<highlight><bold>837</bold></highlight>), when the time is not changed, based on detection of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, presence or absence of the necessary water amount is determined (S<highlight><bold>838</bold></highlight>), only when a result of determining absence of the necessary water amount is provided, measurement of the predetermined stress time period is started (S<highlight><bold>839</bold></highlight>), only when the state of absence of the necessary water amount is maintained during the stress time period (S<highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>841</bold></highlight>), the stress time period is initialized and the water supply processing is carried out (S<highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight>), when the state of absence of the necessary water amount is not maintained, measurement of the stress time period of the timer portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is initialized (S<highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight>) and the operation returns again to determination of whether the time of the calendar portion is changed (S<highlight><bold>837</bold></highlight>). When the time of the calendar portion is changed, in the case of time&equals;time <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the calendar portion, the operation proceeds to B (S<highlight><bold>845</bold></highlight>) and in the case of time&equals;time <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the operation proceeds to D (S<highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> After the operation proceeds to D, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>, the third mode is started (S<highlight><bold>847</bold></highlight>), confirmation of whether of the time is changed by the calendar portion is repeatedly carried out until time is changed (S<highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight>), when the time is changed, in the case of time&equals;time <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the calendar portion, the operation proceeds to B (S<highlight><bold>849</bold></highlight>) and in the case of time&equals;time <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the operation proceeds to C (S<highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> By using the ninth embodiment of the invention, the water control all around the year can be carried out by the automatic water supply system, for example, when the turf grows in March or the like, the system is carried out by the first mode, with respect to the turf from April to October or the like, by carrying out the second mode, the turf is cultivated in a state more proximate to be natural and in the period of dormancy of the turf from November to February, by executing the third mode, life of the turf can be maintained only by natural rainfall and water stored in the water storage tray <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or in the soil to some degree, and by necessary minimum water, control of growing the plant such as excellent turf control or the like can be carried out. Further, according to the above-described example, the time <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signifies March, the time signifies from April to October and time <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> signifies from November to February. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Further, as pertinent modified examples of the respective embodiments of the automatic water supply system according to the invention, for example, there is a case of forming a planting area and using a plurality of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, there is constructed a constitution of installing the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in all of the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or in arbitrary ones of the water storage trays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, further, for example, there is a case of determining absence of the necessary water amount when absence of the necessary water amount is detected based on at least one of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a plurality of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, there is a case of determining absence of the necessary water amount when absence of the necessary water amount is detected based on an arbitrary number of the water content sensors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a plurality thereof and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Further, the third mode of the ninth embodiment is not limited to the constitution of not supplying water but, for example, there may be constructed a constitution of carrying out control by measuring a third stress time period which is a time period longer than the stress time period in the second mode of the eighth embodiment, or, for example, a constitution of carrying out control by measuring third water supply interval time period which is a time period longer than the water supply interval time period in the second mode and in this case, water to some degree can be ensured even at indoors in the third mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> As such a modified example, for example, in the case of the ninth embodiment on the premise of the seventh embodiment, there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply start is controlled by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the first mode, water supply start is controlled by the first stress time period in the second mode and water supply start is controlled by the third stress time period in the third mode. Further, as other modified example of the ninth embodiment, there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply start is controlled by the water supply interval time period in the first mode, water supply start is controlled by the stress time period in the second mode and water supply start is controlled by the third water supply interval time period or the third stress time period in the third mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Further, as other modified example of the ninth embodiment, there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply start is controlled by a first water supply interval time period in the first mode, water supply start is controlled by a second water supply interval time period in the second mode and water supply is controlled by a third water supply interval time period in the third mode. Further, in the case of the ninth embodiment on the premise of the eighth embodiment, there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply start is controlled by a first stress time period in the first mode, the water supply is controlled by a second stress time period in the second mode and water supply is controlled by a third stress time period in the third mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Further, although content of the seventh embodiment is adopted for main control content of the ninth embodiment, particularly for control content of the first mode or the second mode, the invention is not limited thereto but there can be constructed a constitution in which, for example, water supply start is controlled by water supply interval time period in the first mode, water supply start is controlled by stress time period in the second mode and water is not supplied in the third mode. Further, for example, there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply start is controlled by the first water supply interval time period in the first mode, water supply start is controlled by the second water supply interval time period in the second mode and water is not supplied in the third mode. Further, for example, when the eighth embodiment is adopted, there can be constructed a constitution in which water supply start is controlled by the first stress time period in the first mode, water supply start is controlled by the second stress time period in the second mode and water is not supplied in the third mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Further, the water supply interval time period or the stress time period in the above-described respective embodiments is arbitrary, it is possible to set these time periods to be short at times in which water supply is needed and to set these time periods to be long in times in which water supply is not needed so much. Further, even times of the calendar portion can similarly be set pertinently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Further, when the seventh or the eighth or the like is used completely outdoors, basically, the period of dormancy of the turf can be dealt with by cutting the power source of the automatic water supply system. Further, in that case, it is also possible to make the second mode stay as it is without cutting the power source. Further, it is possible to accelerate to grow the turf by carrying out maintenance on first ten days of March, making the power source of the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> ON again and bringing about a state of carrying out the switching mode. Further, it is natural that the turf immediately after construction can be accelerated to take root by the seventh through the ninth embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Further, the plant <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> constituting the object of the automatic water supply system according to the invention is not limited to the turf but the object is constituted by various ones of the plants <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and various ones of the plants <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be dealt with by carrying out various settings therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Further, although according to the above-described respective embodiments, an explanation has been given of the constitution of carrying out the second mode when the nonswitching mode of the switching mode selecting portion is selected, the invention is not limited thereto but there can be constructed a constitution of carrying out only the first mode by setting. Further, the second mode is carried out when the nonswitching mode is selected, in order to deal with the plant which is not provided immediately after construction, for example, when the object is constituted by the plant which takes root without using the automatic water supply system, or when the automatic water supply system is used for the plant which has been supplied with water artificially, the plant <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has already adapted sufficiently to the soil and taken root deep in the soil and therefore, it is not necessary to carry out the first mode and the respective embodiments are described by conceiving such cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Further, although according to the above-described respective embodiments, switching of the mode is carried out by finishing to measure the switching time period in the seventh and the eighth embodiments, and by times in the ninth embodiment, the invention is not limited thereto but the mode maybe switched by providing a sensor for detecting weak acidity in the soil and detecting a state of the turf of taking root, or the mode may be switched by providing a pressure sensor between the soil and the cut turf when the cut turf is mounted and detecting the state of the turf of taking root by the pressure sensor and the sensor of the invention is not limited to the water content sensor. Further, by adopting a system of switching the mode by detecting the state of the turf of taking root, further accurate time of switching the mode can be recognized, further, in the case of using the third mode in which water is not supplied or the water supply amount is small as in the ninth embodiment, it is preferable to switch the mode by times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Further, as water supply means used in the invention, a water supply pipe of a porous pipe may be used, or a mere water supply pipe may be used, or a sprinkler or the like may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Further, although an explanation has been given up to the third mode according to the ninth embodiment, the invention is not limited up to the third mode but there may be constructed a constitution in which a fourth or higher mode is prepared in accordance with the kind of the plant and these modes may be switched as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Further, although according to the above-described embodiments, the control means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is constructed by the constitution in which the power source is made ON and the switching mode or the nonswitching mode is selected by the switching mode selecting portion, the invention is not limited thereto but there can be constructed a constitution in which the switching mode is carried out by setting to initialize the mode automatically by making the power source ON other than the case in which the nonswitching mode is particularly selected by the switching mode selecting portion, or a constitution of carrying out the nonswitching mode by setting to initialize the mode automatically by making the power source ON other than the case in which the switching mode is conversely carried out by the switching mode selecting portion. Further, for example, when the switching time period is set to 2 weeks as initial setting, there may be constructed a constitution in which it is determined that the nonswitching mode is selected, for example, by setting to change the switching time period to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Further, although according to the seventh and the eighth embodiments, an explanation has been given of the constitution in which there is not carried out determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount based on detection of the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> during a time period until water supply is finished, the invention is not limited to the embodiments but there may be constructed a constitution of carrying out determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> even in the water supply processing. In this case, for example, there are carried out processings F<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through F<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> or processings F<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through F<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of a flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> in the water supply processing. Although a result of determining presence or absence of the necessary water amount does not influence on the water supply processing, by constructing the constitution, there can be omitted a program with regard to a time period of carrying out determination of presence or absence of the necessary water amount by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (setting a time period of not carrying out detection of the necessary water amount by the water content sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) and the inexpensive and highly safe automatic water supply system can be provided. </paragraph>
