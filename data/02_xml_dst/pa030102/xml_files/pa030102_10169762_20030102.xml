<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a driving method of a liquid crystal display panel which enables a reduction in power consumption by driving a liquid crystal display panel, which performs display by changing optical characteristics thereof by applying voltage to a liquid crystal layer composed of a memory liquid crystal, at a low voltage or by stopping the driving signal in accordance with a driving environment, and a liquid crystal display device whose liquid crystal display panel is driven by the driving method. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device is composed of a liquid crystal display panel and a drive circuit thereof, and the basic configuration of the liquid crystal display panel is such that a first substrate formed with many scanning electrodes on the inner face and a second substrate formed with many data electrodes, in such a manner to be perpendicular to the scanning electrodes, on the inner face, are bonded together with a fixed gap provided therebetween, a liquid crystal layer is sealed in the gap, and portions where the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes oppose each other with the liquid crystal layer sandwiched therebetween become pixel portions respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As a driving method of this liquid crystal display panel, a method is employed which applies selection signals in a time division manner to all the scanning electrodes constituting the pixel portions of the liquid crystal display panel and applies a data signal to the data electrode in correspondence with the selection signal of each scanning electrode to induce an optical change in the liquid crystal layer at the individual pixel to thereby perform display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In such a driving method of the liquid crystal display panel, when the number of pixels of the liquid crystal display panel is increased to improve its display quality, the time during which the signal can be applied to one pixel is decreased, and thus it is necessary to increase the voltage of the selection signal or to increase the voltage of the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, since the display disappears if the liquid crystal is not supplied with charge in a predetermined cycle, it is necessary to apply a predetermined voltage in a fixed cycle even for the same display contents. Therefore, an increase in the number of scanning electrodes causes an increase in the frequency for switching the voltage of the selection signal and also an increase in the frequency of the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The output voltage and the output frequency of a circuit for applying a predetermined selection signal and data signal to the liquid crystal display panel accordingly become higher to increase the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the liquid crystal display panel is used for a small portable electronic device, however, there is a limit in thickness, weight, and volume of the case thereof and there is also a restriction in battery capacity. Hence, it is required to enable operation for a long time by a battery having a capacity as small as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, a liquid crystal display device having a power generating function is scarcely commercialized in the status quo. The reason is that the electric power consumed is very large as compared to the capacity of a storage battery which stores energy therein. Therefore, it is important to allow the liquid crystal display device to function for a time as long as possible by a predetermined battery capacity, and it can be said that it is also preferable for the earth environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a method, as a method of reducing the power consumption, which does not perform display on a part or the entire face of the liquid crystal display panel, but it is not preferable because a decrease in display area results in a reduction in the display contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Hence, it is desired to reduce the electric power consumed while allowing a display to be performed on the entire face of the liquid crystal display panel constituting the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case of a liquid crystal display device provided with a power generating element, it is necessary to balance the amount of power generated by the power generating element and the amount of power consumed by the liquid crystal display device, and therefore it is necessary to reduce the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. Especially when a photovoltaic element is disposed as the power generating element on the observer side of the liquid crystal display panel and at a position adjacent to the liquid crystal display panel, it is necessary to decrease the area of the photovoltaic element and to increase the proportion of transmitting portions around the photovoltaic element to prevent the display quality of the liquid crystal display panel from deteriorating. Thus, it is very important to reduce the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Hence, it is an object of this invention to reduce power consumption while keeping as much as possible display contents displayed on a liquid crystal display panel constituting a liquid crystal display device so as to increase battery life. Specifically, it is an object to attain a reduction in the power consumption without decreasing its display region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, it is another object to substantially reduce power consumption, also in a liquid crystal display device having a power generating function, by appropriately controlling the driving waveform of a liquid crystal display panel to enable driving of the liquid crystal display panel by a power generating element with a small power generation amount which cannot be used in the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To attain the above-described objects, this invention provides the following driving method of a liquid crystal display panel and liquid crystal display device: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the driving method of a liquid crystal display panel according to this invention is a driving method of a liquid crystal display panel in which a liquid crystal layer is sealed between a transparent first substrate formed with a plurality of scanning electrodes and a transparent second substrate formed with a plurality of data electrodes, the electrodes being formed on respective inner faces opposing each other, and portions where the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes oppose each other with the liquid crystal layer sandwiched therebetween constitute pixel portions respectively, and which performs display by an electrooptical change having a memory property in the liquid crystal layer at each pixel portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The driving method is characterized in that selection signals are applied to the plurality of scanning electrodes and a data signal is applied to the data electrode in correspondence with the selection signal of each scanning electrode to control the individual pixel portion independently, and a plurality of selection signals having different selection periods each for selecting one scanning electrode are selectively applied as the selection signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that a liquid crystal layer charge memory period, during which potentials of the scanning electrode and the data electrode are set to the same potential or a floating potential, is provided after each pixel portion within a display region of the liquid crystal display panel is selected at least once and display contents thereof are rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it is also adoptable that a liquid crystal layer charge memory period is provided after each pixel portion within a display region of the liquid crystal display panel is repeatedly selected and display contents thereof are rewritten a plurality of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that a refresh period for applying a refresh voltage for canceling unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer at the same time to the liquid crystal layer between each of the plurality of scanning electrodes and each of the plurality of data electrodes is provided before the selection period of a first scanning electrode by the selection signal, and voltages of both positive and negative polarities are applied as the refresh voltage by the selection signal and the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it is also adoptable that a refresh period for applying a refresh voltage for canceling unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer to the liquid crystal layer between the scanning electrode and the data electrode associated therewith is provided before the selection period of each scanning electrode by the selection signal, and voltages of both positive and negative polarities are applied as the refresh voltage by the selection signal and the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is possible to perform a whole display rewriting in which the selection signal is applied to each of the scanning electrodes constituting all the pixel portions within a display region of the liquid crystal display panel, and the data signal is applied to each data electrode in correspondence with the selection signal of each scanning electrode to thereby rewrite display contents of all the pixel portions. Further, it is also possible to perform a partial display rewriting in which the selection signals are applied only to the scanning electrodes constituting the pixel portions within a display change region where display contents are changed within the display region, the data signals are applied only to the data electrodes associated therewith respectively, and potentials of the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes constituting the pixel portions except for the display change region are set to a floating potential to thereby rewrite a part of display contents of the display region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is preferable that the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode by the selection signal is made longer in the partial display rewriting than in the whole display rewriting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that a potential difference between the scanning electrode to which the selection signal is applied and the data electrode to which the data signal is applied is made smaller in the partial display rewriting than in the whole display rewriting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that when the partial display rewriting is switched to the whole display rewriting, a refresh period for applying a refresh voltage for canceling unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer at the same time to the liquid crystal layer between each of the plurality of scanning electrodes and each of the plurality of data electrodes is provided before start of the whole display rewriting, and voltages of both positive and negative polarities are applied as the refresh voltage by the selection signal and the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that a voltage amplitude of at least one of the selection signal and the data signal is decreased as the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode by the selection signal is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that a longest selection period for selecting one scanning electrode by the selection signal is 100 milliseconds or more, and it can be, for example, one minute, one hour, one day or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that a potential difference between the selection signal to be applied to the scanning electrode and the data signal to be applied to the data electrode when the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode by the selection signal is short is made larger than a potential difference between the selection signal and the data signal when the selection period is long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further, it is desirable that the plurality of selection signals having different selection periods are changed after the pixel portions at least within a predetermined region in the display region of the liquid crystal display panel are selected and display contents thereof are rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is also possible that the selection signal and the data signal are generated by electric energy generated by a power generating element or by discharge energy of a storage battery for storing the electric energy, and the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode by the selection signal is changed in accordance with an amount of power generated by the power generating element or an amount of power stored in the storage battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is preferable that the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode by the selection signal is made shorter and a potential difference between the selection signal to be applied to the scanning electrode and the data signal to be applied to the data electrode is made larger when the amount of power generated by the power generating element or the amount of power stored in the storage battery is large than when it is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, the plurality of selection signals are switched at a set point of time, and one selection signal of the plurality of selection signals has a period during which a potential thereof to the data signal is positive and a period during which the potential is negative in the selection period of one scanning electrode, which makes it possible to prevent unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer by using the selection signal to eliminate the necessity for providing the refresh period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it is more preferable that one selection signal of the plurality of selection signals has a period during which a potential thereof to the data signal is positive and a period during which the potential is negative in the selection period of one scanning electrode, and an order of the period during which the potential of the selection signal to the data signal is positive and the period during which the potential is negative is reversed in a field and in the next field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it is also adoptable that each selection signal applies voltages of the same polarity during the period for selecting each scanning electrode in a sequential plurality of fields, and thereafter applies voltages of both positive and negative polarities during the period for selecting one scanning electrode in the next field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that in a mode of reducing power consumption, voltages of one polarity to the data signal are applied as the selection signal during the selection period of each scanning electrode by the selection signal, and a refresh period for applying a refresh voltage for canceling unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer at the same time to the liquid crystal layer between each of the plurality of scanning electrodes and each of the plurality of data electrodes is provided before the selection period of a first scanning electrode by the selection signal, and voltages of both positive and negative polarities are applied as the refresh voltage by the selection signal and the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it is also adoptable that in another mode of reducing power consumption, there are provided a field, in which voltages of one polarity to the data signal are applied as the selection signal during the selection period of the scanning electrode by the selection signal, and a field, in which voltages of both positive and negative polarities are applied, and a refresh period for applying a refresh voltage for canceling unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer at the same time to the liquid crystal layer between each of the plurality of scanning electrodes and each of the plurality of data electrodes is provided before the selection period of a first scanning electrode by the selection signal, and voltages of both positive and negative polarities are applied as the refresh voltage by the selection signal and the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is preferable that the selection period of one scanning electrode is made longer in the field, in which the voltages of both positive and negative polarities to the data signal are applied as the selection signal, than in the field, in which the voltages of one polarity are applied, and absolute values of the voltages of both polarities are made equal to absolute values of the voltages of one polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Next, the liquid crystal display device according to this invention comprises: a liquid crystal display panel in which a liquid crystal layer is sealed between a transparent first substrate formed with a plurality of scanning electrodes and a transparent second substrate formed with a plurality of data electrodes, the electrodes being formed on respective inner faces opposing each other, and portions where the scanning electrodes and data electrodes oppose each other with the liquid crystal layer sandwiched therebetween constitute pixel portions respectively, and which performs display by an electrooptical change having a memory property in the liquid crystal layer at each pixel portion; and a liquid crystal display panel drive circuit for applying selection signals to the plurality of scanning electrodes and applying a data signal to the data electrode in correspondence with the selection signal of each scanning electrode to control the individual pixel portion independently, and for selectively applying, as the selection signals, a plurality of selection signals each having different selection periods for selecting one scanning electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is possible to use, as the liquid crystal layer performing an electrooptical change having a memory property, a chiral nematic liquid crystal layer, a ferroelectric liquid crystal layer, an antiferroelectric liquid crystal layer, a scattering type liquid crystal layer composed of a ferroelectric liquid crystal and a transparent solid substance containing a ferroelectric liquid crystal, and the like. </paragraph>

There is a chiral smectic liquid crystal as a representative of the ferroelectric liquid crystal, and this chiral smectic liquid crystal is used in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A chiral smectic phase showing ferroelectricity is typically of a spiral structure, but it becomes, for example, in a cell gap thinner than 2 &mgr;m, not the spiral structure but a state in which a domain where liquid crystal molecules incline in a positive molecular direction <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from a smectic phase normal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a domain where liquid crystal molecules incline in a negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are mixed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> due to the interface with the alignment films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Since the display becomes best and ideal when the inclinations are &plus;22.5&deg; and &minus;22.5&deg;, the liquid crystal molecules are adjusted to have these angles by alignment films <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> When a voltage is applied to this chiral smectic liquid crystal layer, the directions of spontaneous polarization align in one direction to provide a state in which the directions of the molecules are aligned. Alternatively, when a voltage of the polarity opposite to the above is applied thereto, the molecules are aligned in the opposite direction to the above. Once the directions of the molecules are aligned, the state in which the directions thereof are aligned is kept even after the application of the voltage is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The above-described state can be understood as the liquid crystal molecules moving along a ridge line of a circular cone <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> forming an angle of 45&deg; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> due to the polarity of the applied voltage, and thus it is possible to change the directions of the molecules in the liquid crystal layer by changing the polarity of the voltage so as to change the optical axes thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a transmission axis <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is thus arranged parallel to the negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a transmission axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged perpendicular to the negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to realize display that becomes a dark display when a voltage of positive polarity is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and becomes a bright display when a voltage of negative polarity is applied thereto, in the case of display using light of an external light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the state in which the molecules are aligned in the positive molecular direction <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, linearly polarized light which has passed through the transmission axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from the visible side is made incident on the liquid crystal molecules in a polarization direction of 45&deg; to become circularly polarized light when passing through the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> due to birefringence, and reflected by the second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is a reflection type polarizer, to become linearly polarized light rotated 90&deg; from the state at the time of incident when passing again through the liquid crystal layer due to the birefringence to be made incident on the absorption axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, so that no light goes out to the visible side, resulting in a dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the state in which the molecules are aligned in the negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the linearly polarized light which has passed through the transmission axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from the visible side passes, as it is, through the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> because the polarization direction thereof is parallel to the liquid crystal molecules, is made incident on the reflection axis of the second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is a reflection type polarizer to be reflected, and passes again through the transmission axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to go out to the visible side. The diffusing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which does not change the polarization state is provided here to suppress glare of display, resulting in a bright display that is a white display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The display when performed by the light emitted by the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is inverted in brightness and darkness to the display when performed by the light of the external light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the state in which the molecules are aligned in the positive molecular direction <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the linearly polarized light which has passed through the transmission axis of the second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> side is made incident on the liquid crystal molecules in a polarization direction of 45&deg; to become circularly polarized light when passing through the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> due to birefringence, so that a part of the light passes through the transmission axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to go out to the visible side, resulting in a bright display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the state in which the molecules are aligned in the negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the linearly polarized light which has passed through the transmission axis of the second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the auxiliary light source side passes, as it is, through the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> because the polarization direction thereof is perpendicular to the liquid crystal molecules, and is made incident on the absorption axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to be absorbed and not to go out to the visible side, resulting in a dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the driving signals having opposite polarities of voltages applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are used for the reflection display using the external light source and for the transmission display using the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. An explanation will be made of the driving signal for performing the reflection display unless otherwise particularly noted, for convenience of explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the experiment by the inventor, a holding characteristic (memory property) of display was better when a silicon oxide (SiOx) film was used as the material of the alignment film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> than when a polyimide resin was used. Further, the memory property could be improved also in a hybrid case in which the alignment film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be formed on the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was made of a silicon oxide film and the alignment film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be formed on the second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> was made of a polyimide resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned by the silicon oxide films formed, on the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> including the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> including the data electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in a 45&deg; direction to the substrates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by the oblique evaporation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a graph showing the relationship between the brightness of display and the applied voltage when a standard selection signal and a standard data signal for rewriting the display region once at a frequency of typically used video rate (30 Hz) or higher are applied to the liquid crystal layer structured as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the brightness of display is indicated on the vertical axis and the applied voltage is indicated on the horizontal axis. A state of low brightness here shows a dark display in the absorption state, and a state of high brightness shows a bright display with a strong reflection characteristic. Further, the right side of the graph shows a state of the applied voltage to the liquid crystal layer being positive polarity and the left side shows a state thereof being negative polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, in the case of display performed in the standard mode, when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is changed from the bright display state in which the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the brightness of display changes as shown by a positive polarity application curved line <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the brightness does not change only by stopping application of the voltage to zero voltage, the state of the bright display being held, and when a large voltage of positive polarity is applied, the display decreases in brightness to a dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is changed from this state, the brightness of display changes as shown by a negative polarity application curved line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the brightness does not change only by stopping application of the voltage to zero voltage, the state of the dark display being held. When a voltage having a large absolute value of negative polarity is applied, the display increases in brightness to a bright display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In other words, the display in the liquid crystal display device has a memory property so that it is possible to hold the state thereof last performed even if the applied voltage is brought to zero or at least one of the electrodes is set at a floating potential after a voltage having a large absolute value is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In such a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the memory property, it is possible to create a great optical change as in the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> even by a small voltage by applying the voltage for a time several tens of times or 1000 or more times longer than that in the standard selection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the brightness of display is indicated on the vertical axis and the applied voltage is indicated on the horizontal axis. The right half of the graph shows a state of the applied voltage to the liquid crystal layer being positive polarity and the left half shows a state thereof being negative polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the case of application of voltage for a long time, when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is changed from the bright display state in which the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the negative molecular direction <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the brightness of display changes as shown by a power-saving mode positive polarity application curved line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Further, when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is changed from the dark display state in which the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the positive molecular direction <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the brightness of display changes as shown by a power-saving mode negative polarity application curved line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In other words, even such display has a memory property so that it is possible to hold the state thereof last performed even if the applied voltage is brought to zero or at least one of the electrodes is set at a floating potential after a voltage having a somewhat large absolute value is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> However, since the period for applying a signal to one electrode is long, differing from the display in the standard mode, it is possible to switch the bright and dark displays by the application of a voltage greatly smaller than that in the standard mode to reduce the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment realizes a liquid crystal display device having a very low power consumption by providing a power-saving mode which has a selection period for selecting each electrode longer than that of the standard mode through the use of such a characteristic so as to perform display in the power-saving mode when there is no need to switch the display to a high speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The driving signal in the standard mode for performing display on the liquid crystal display panel of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows waveforms of the driving signal for performing display on the liquid crystal display panel in the standard mode. A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a first standard selection signal to be applied to a first scanning electrode, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a first standard data signal to be applied to a data electrode, and A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a composite waveform of them which is a waveform showing a voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> here shows an example of a signal for bringing all the pixels on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Further, A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is also a waveform of the first standard data signal and A<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a composite waveform of this signal and the first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and this A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> shows an example of a signal for bringing all the pixels on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the bright display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, in the following explanation, the period from selection of the first scanning electrode to rewrite once display contents of each pixel portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the display region of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to reselection of the first scanning electrode to rewrite them the next time, is defined as a field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The horizontal axis of the waveform diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, in which each of Tf(&plus;) and Tf(&minus;) indicates one field (write period for one picture). Each of the Tf(&plus;) and Tf(&minus;) shall be {fraction (1/120)} of a second here to prevent flicker. Accordingly, assuming that the number of scanning electrodes is <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, the selection period for selecting one electrode is about 17 microseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The vertical axis is an axis representing voltage. The first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a signal at five levels from V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the middle is 0 V (volts). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> To prevent a direct current component from being applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which is the period for selecting the first scanning electrode, is further divided into four parts in the fist standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that a positive voltage at V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is applied during a first application period and a fourth application period and a negative voltage at V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied during a second application period and a third application period. The voltage at V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that as for a first standard selection signal for selecting another electrode, voltages corresponding to those from the aforesaid first application period to the fourth application period are applied during the selection period for selecting the electrode, and the voltage at V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Further, the first standard data signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a signal at a high frequency of a square wave which reciprocates between voltages at V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and is repeated two cycles in the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The first standard data signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in a phase in which the high voltage at V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is applied during the first application period in the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to form a composite waveform like A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the voltage having a large absolute value which is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the last time in the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a positive voltage at V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (&equals;V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) applied during the fourth application period, so that a pixel to which these two signals are applied becomes a dark display. Thereafter, a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied until the first scanning electrode is selected the next time, so that the dark display is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the first standard data signal A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is also the same square wave as that of the first standard data signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but is in a phase in which the low voltage at V<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is applied during the first application period. Accordingly, the composite waveform thereof with the first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes like A<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the voltage having a large absolute value which is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the last time in the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a negative voltage at V<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (&equals;V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) applied during the second application period, so that a pixel to which these two signals are applied becomes a bright display. Thereafter, a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied until the first scanning electrode is selected the next time, so that the bright display is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the standard mode, such signals are applied to each of the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and data electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to perform display. It should be noted that since the driving waveform repeating the same display is shown here, the signals are the same in the Tf(&plus;) field and in the Tf(&minus;) field, and since the polarities are reversed in the selection period of each scanning electrode in the first standard selection signal to prevent the direct current from being applied to the liquid crystal layer, it is unnecessary to reverse the polarities in the Tf(&plus;) field and in the Tf(&minus;) field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> By the way, in such a standard mode, the optical characteristics of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> should be changed in a short time to write about 120 pictures per second, and it is thus necessary to increase the driving voltage. This results in an increase in power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the selection signal applied to the first (first row) scanning electrode will be shown as an example of the selection signal unless otherwise particularly noted, also including a waveform diagram used for the explanation of each embodiment hereafter, and selection signals having the same waveform for selecting in a time division manner are applied to other scanning electrodes. Further, the data signal applied to one of the data electrodes will be shown as an example of the data signal unless otherwise particularly noted, and different signals are applied to the data electrodes in accordance with the display contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The driving waveform in the power-saving mode which is the feature of this invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a waveform diagram showing waveforms of signals for driving the liquid crystal display panel in a first power-saving mode, in which B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a first power-saving selection signal, and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a first power-saving data signal. B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a composite waveform of them which is a waveform showing a voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other. B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> here shows an example of a signal for bringing all the pixels on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> This figure is the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. However, a Tg(&plus;) field and a Tg(&minus;) field each corresponding to a write period for displaying one picture are time periods 100 times longer than the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field respectively in the case of the standard mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Accordingly, a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is also a period 100 times that of the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> used in this embodiment has a memory property, so that even when there is an interval from the first write to the next write due to the increase in the write period as described above, the display never deteriorates during the period to enable the display with the same quality as that in the standard mode to be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> To prevent a direct current component from being applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the selection period <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which is the period for selecting the first scanning electrode, is further divided into four parts also in the fist power-saving selection signal B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that a positive voltage at Va is applied during a first application period and a fourth application period and a negative voltage at Ve is applied during a second application period and a third application period. A voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that as for a first power-saving selection signal for selecting another electrode, voltages corresponding to those from the aforesaid first application period to the fourth application period are applied during the selection period for selecting the electrode and the voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Further, the first power-saving data signal B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a signal of a square wave which reciprocates between voltages at Vf and Vh and is repeated two cycles in the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The first power-saving data signal B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in a phase in which the high voltage at Vf is applied during the first application period in the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to form a composite waveform like B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the first power-saving selection signal B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the voltage having a large absolute value which is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the last time in the selection period <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is a positive voltage at Vi (&equals;Va&minus;Vh) applied during the fourth application period, so that a pixel to which these two signals are applied becomes a dark display. Thereafter, a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied until the first scanning electrode is selected the next time, so that the dark display is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> When the bright display is performed, it is only required to apply the low voltage at Vh during the first application period by shifting the phase of the first power-saving data signal B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by a half wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> According to each power-saving signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is possible to induce the optical change in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by a low voltage because the application period thereof is 100 times longer than that of the signal in the standard mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The potential difference between the applied potentials Va and Ve used for the first power-saving selection signal B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced to about one-third the potential difference between V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the signal levels Vf to Vh for the first power-saving data signal B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the signal levels Vi to Vm for the composite signal B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can also be reduced to about one-third the respective potentials used for the signals in the standard mode. Therefore, the display can be performed by a power consumption lower than that in the standard mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In this liquid crystal display device of the first embodiment, it is also possible to further increase the selection period so as to perform display by a signal at further lower voltage. The driving waveform of a second power-saving mode is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. However, a Th(&plus;) field and a Th(&minus;) field each for performing one picture are time periods still several tens of times longer than the Tg(&plus;) field and the Tg(&minus;) field respectively in the case of the power-saving mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Accordingly, a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is a period of about 100 milliseconds, which is also still several tens of times that of the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Further, C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a second power-saving selection signal, C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a waveform of a second power-saving data signal, and C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a composite waveform of them which is a waveform showing a voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other. C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> here shows an example of a signal for bringing a pixel on the first row on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the dark display and holding displays of other pixels during the first write period, and for bringing all the pixels on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the dark display during the next write period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The second power-saving selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at Vq during the selection period <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which is a period for selecting the first scanning electrode and applies a voltage at Vr during the other periods. The second power-saving data signal C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at Vx during the selection period <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and applies a voltage at Vw during the other periods in the first field Th(&plus;). In the next field Th(&minus;), the voltage at Vx is applied during all the periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As a result, the voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> becomes like C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the applied voltage is thus V<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during the selection period <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, so that this pixel becomes the dark display and the display is held during the other periods due to the memory property of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> When the pixel is switched to the bright display, a field (write period) is provided in which display is performed by a power-saving selection signal for applying a voltage at Vs in place of Vq during the period for selecting a scanning electrode and a power-saving data signal for applying a voltage at Vv in place of Vx during the period for selecting a pixel for performing the bright display. In this write period, it is selectable whether the pixel is switched into the bright display or the display until then is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Typically, the polarities are not reversed in each selection period in the second power-saving selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second power-saving data signal C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the voltage switching frequency can be still lower than that in the case where the selection periods of the first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the first standard data signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are just increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> However, the selection period is made a period four times the selection period <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> once for every several writes, in which a first application period <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, a second application period <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a third application period <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and a fourth application period <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are provided, and positive and negative voltages having large absolute values are applied during this period to prevent unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The second power-saving selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies the voltage at Vq during the first application period <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the fourth application period <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the voltage at Vs during the second application period <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the third application period <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The second power-saving data signal C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies the voltage at Vv during the first application period <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the third application period <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and the voltage at Vx during the second application period <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the fourth application period <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The provision of the selection period having a length four times as long as described above can prevent a direct current voltage from being applied to the liquid crystal layer through the use of a signal at a potential having a small absolute value which is the same as the potential used in this second power-saving mode, resulting in reduced power consumption. However, if the selection period is made to have this length in every write period, the display undesirably flicks and it is disadvantageous in terms of power consumption, and thus the period having this length shall be provided only once for every several writes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In the second power-saving mode described above, since the selection period is increased to be several hundreds times to a thousand times longer than the standard selection period, the driving voltage can be decreased to about several volts that is about one-tenth that of the standard mode. In other words, it is possible to reduce the potential difference between the applied voltages Vp and Vt used in the second power-saving selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be about one-tenth the potential difference between V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the first standard selection signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Similarly, it is also possible to reduce the potential difference between applied voltages Vu and Vy used in the second power-saving data signal C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be about one-tenth the potential difference between V<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the first standard data signal. Further, it is also possible to reduce the potential difference between potentials V<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the composite signal C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> actually applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to be about one-tenth the potential difference between V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the case of the standard mode. Furthermore, as is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the frequency of the driving signal is also very reduced, so that it is possible to extremely reduce the power consumption required for driving the liquid crystal display panel and the power consumption of the drive circuit of the liquid crystal display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The above-described signal waveforms in the power-saving mode utilize the characteristics of the liquid crystal display panel shown on a graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The horizontal axis in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> represents a time required for the liquid crystal layer to reach predetermined optical characteristics, that is, a response time, and the vertical axis represents the power consumption in a relative value (ARB). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> A curved line <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on this graph indicates that the power consumption sharply increases when the response speed is high, that is, when the response time is reduced to be shorter than 100 milliseconds. Accordingly, the liquid crystal display panel is driven in a response time of 100 milliseconds or more to enable an extreme reduction in the amount of electric power consumed by the liquid crystal display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> As is clear from this graph, it becomes possible to greatly reduce the voltage which causes the liquid crystal layer to attain the predetermined optical characteristics by increasing the application time (response time) of the voltage to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is effective in reducing the power consumption to decrease the voltage amplitude of the driving signal and the potential difference between the selection signal and the data signal which are applied to the liquid crystal layer as the selection period is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Further, the power consumption shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> does not include a contribution by the frequency of the drive circuit of the liquid crystal display device, and thus it can be said that the power consumption can be reduced to be still lower than the value shown on the graph in consideration of the contribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> A reduction in the voltage for performing the optical change in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> effects the reduction in the power consumption in particular. For example, a potential difference of 12 V applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is required to drive it in a response time of 1 millisecond, but the optical change can be attained by 4 V for the case of a response time of 100 milliseconds, 2.5 V for 1 second, and 1.5 V for 2.5 seconds. This enables simplification of a voltage-up converter necessary for the selection signal and the data signal applied to the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the prevention of loss of the electric power in the liquid crystal display device, which is effective in reducing the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The selection period for selecting each scanning electrode is allowed to be selected from a plurality of periods, and the signal waveform is allowed to be selected from a plurality of waveforms so as to select an appropriate selection period and signal waveform in accordance with the operation state and the necessary write frequency as in this embodiment, which makes it possible to realize the reduction in power consumption while the display quality is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In this case, the same selection period and signal waveform shall be used in one write period, and a change shall be performed between one write period and the next write period. The same applies to the following embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The driving waveform of a liquid crystal display device in the second embodiment of the invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The liquid crystal display device to which the driving waveform in this embodiment is applied is the same as that explained in the first embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a second standard selection signal D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second standard data signals D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which are the driving waveform in the standard mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Each standard signal of the second embodiment of this invention applies an alternate current waveform by switching between signals of positive polarity and negative polarity for each field of Tf(&plus;) and Tf(&minus;). A voltage of positive polarity is applied in the Tf(&plus;) field, and a voltage of negative polarity is applied in the Tf(&minus;) field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> To prevent flicker, one field is set 16 milliseconds (msec.) to several msec. in the case of the display sequentially updated, and it shall be {fraction (1/120)} of a second (about 8 milliseconds) here. In the case of a short write period, an increase in the frequency for driving the liquid crystal and an increase in the voltage applied to the liquid crystal cause an increase in the electric current consumed by the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> A second standard selection signal D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of a five-level signal of V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the Tf(&plus;) field, during a selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for selecting a first scanning electrode, a first selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is applied to the scanning electrode and a first non-selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied during the other selection periods. In the Tf(&minus;) field, a second selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied to the scanning electrode during the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode, and a second non-selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied during the other selection periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The second standard selection signal to be applied to a second scanning electrode applies, in the Tf(&plus;) field, the first selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> during a selection period for selecting the second scanning electrode and the first non-selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the other selection periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the second standard selection signal to be applied to a third scanning electrode applies, in the Tf(&plus;) field, the first selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> during a selection period for selecting the third scanning electrode and the first non-selection signal voltage at the voltage level V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the other selection periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> To other scanning electrodes, the selection signal voltage for selecting the scanning electrodes and the non-selection voltage are similarly applied in a time division manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a ternary signal at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is applied to a data electrode to perform ON/OFF display. A second standard data signal D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> This second standard data signal D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies, in the Tf(&plus;) field, a first data voltage at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a voltage at V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the other periods. In the Tf(&minus;) field, a second data voltage at V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is applied during the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The second standard data signal D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a waveform for applying a large voltage (V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) only to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a pixel on a first row on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, to bring the pixel into the dark display and not applying a voltage having a large absolute value to the pixels formed by the data electrode and other scanning electrodes to hold the display in the Tf(&plus;) field, and for applying a negative voltage having a large absolute value (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) only to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixel on the first row on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, to bring the pixel into the bright display and not applying a voltage having a large absolute value to the other pixels to hold the display in the Tf(&minus;) field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> A second standard data signal D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also shown as a signal to be applied to another data electrode. On the data electrode to which this signal is applied, in the Tf(&plus;) field, a large voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at pixels on odd-numbered rows so that the pixels become the dark display, and a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at pixels on even-numbered rows so that the display is held. In the Tf(&minus;) field, a negative voltage having a large absolute value is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixels on the odd-numbered rows so that the pixels become the bright display, and a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixels on the even-numbered rows so that the display is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the number of scanning electrodes is <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> microseconds as one field Tf is {fraction (1/120)} of a second, and further a potential difference between the voltages V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of 30 volts is required, which requires switching of a large voltage in a short time, resulting in a state of a large amount of electric power being consumed by the circuit for generating the selection signal and the data signal and the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In other words, the liquid crystal display device is in a state of consuming a large amount of electric power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a third power-saving selection signal E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a third power-saving data signal E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is a composite waveform of them and a waveform showing a voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other, which are the driving signal in the power-saving mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. However, a Ti(&plus;) field and a Ti(&minus;) field each for displaying one picture shall be 1 second which is a time period 120 times longer than each of the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field in the case of the standard mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Accordingly, a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a period of about 2 milliseconds which is also 120 times longer than the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The third power-saving selection signal E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at Va during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode and a voltage at Vc during the other periods. The third power saving data signal E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an example of a data signal for bringing the pixel on the first row on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the dark display, and applies a voltage at Vd during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a voltage at Vc during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> As a result, in the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a relatively large plus voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixel on the first row on the data electrode to which the third power-saving data signal E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied, so that the pixel becomes the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Since the increase in selection period enables an optical change to be induced in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by a signal having a small voltage amplitude, the driving voltage becomes five levels from Va to Ve, so as to make the potential difference about 10 volts that is a fraction of the potential difference between V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This only requires switching of an extremely small voltage, resulting in a state of an extremely small electric power consumed by the circuit for generating the selection signal and the data signal, and the liquid crystal display panel. In other words, the liquid crystal display device can be in a state of consuming an extremely small amount of electric power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Further, the third power-saving selection signal E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the third power-saving data signal E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are not reversed in polarity in each of the fields Ti(&plus;) and Ti(&minus;). In other words, when the display is performed in the power-saving mode, switching of voltage of the signal waveform is reduced in number as small as possible for prevention of disorder of display and for power saving. When writing is performed to bring a pixel into the bright display, however, the display is performed using a signal which is reversed in polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> It is possible to attain the optical change at a low voltage by employing the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is composed of a liquid crystal with a memory property for attaining the optical change by accumulating applied electric power, and preparing a plurality of switching frequencies of the selection signal and the data signal to select in accordance with the driving condition as described above, particularly by increasing each field to be the order of a second or more, so that the amount of electric power consumed by the liquid crystal display panel can be reduced to enable a further reduction in the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>

Further, the driving waveforms in the standard mode explained in the first and second embodiments may be used for the driving waveform in the standard mode in this embodiment, and thus the explanation thereof is also omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a fourth power-saving selection signal F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a fourth power-saving data signal F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are the driving waveforms in the power saving mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. However, write periods in a Tj(&plus;) field and a Tj(&minus;) field are very long as compared to those of the standard selection signal, and they are periods of 100 milliseconds to the order of a second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment is characterized in that, to prevent an unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a selection signal and a data signal, each of which is a group of three voltages composed of a positive voltage, a zero voltage and a negative voltage, are applied in the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode such that the potential difference between the selection signal and the data signal has positive and negative values symmetrical with respect to the ground potential. It is another characteristic that a liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, during which the selection signal and the data signal are at the same potential without potential difference therebetween, is provided in addition to the selection period for selecting each scanning electrode to allow the liquid crystal layer to hold the charge during this period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> In the fields Tj(&plus;) and Tj(&minus;) of this embodiment, in addition to a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> representing a period for selecting the first scanning electrode and a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>&prime; which is a period for selecting the other scanning electrodes, the liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is provided for holding the display at the point of time when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is brought to zero in the whole display region. Therefore, the fields Tj(&plus;) and Tj(&minus;) are called write periods for convenience, which does not mean that a write is being performed at any scanning electrode all the time during the periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The fourth power-saving selection signal shown by F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially applies voltages at three levels Va, Vc and Ve during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the Tj(&plus;) field. The voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods including the liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the fourth power-saving data signal F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an example of a data signal for bringing the pixel on the first row on the data electrode into the dark display, and sequentially applies voltages at three levels Vd, Vc and Vb during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In the Tf(&minus;) field, the fourth power-saving selection signal F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially applies voltages at three levels Ve, Vc and Va during the power saving selection period <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods including the liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> As a result, during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a negative voltage (Ve&minus;Vb), a zero voltage (Vc&minus;Vc), and a positive voltage (Va&minus;Vd) are sequentially applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixel on the first row on the data electrode to which the fourth power-saving data signal F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied, resulting in the dark display at last. During the other periods, a zero voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that the display is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The positive and negative voltages symmetrical with respect to the ground potential are applied during the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode as described above to prevent unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, Tf(&plus;) is a field for writing the bright display and Tf(&minus;) is a field for writing the dark display. Further, it is not always necessary to provide the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field alternately, and, for example, when only the bright display needs to be written, only the Tf(&plus;) filed may be provided in succession. Furthermore, the length of each field is not necessarily fixed, and the liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> may be continued after a write is performed until rewriting of the display becomes necessary next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Further, it is also applicable to provide the liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> after a field provided with no liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is repeated a plurality of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> If the same display is continued in succession for a long time, for example, for several minutes to several hours, and more than that, for several days, until the display is rewritten, the selection of the first scanning electrode in the display region to the selection of the last scanning electrode are implemented in serial to write the same display again every predetermined time, for example, every minute or every hour, but the power consumption increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In the case of the same display continued for a long time, the power consumption can be reduced here by counting the time period of the liquid crystal layer charge memory period <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> or by providing an environment sensor provided in the liquid crystal display device, particularly, an optical sensor for sensing the brightness in the external environment to select the number of implementation of rewriting the display depending on the brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The above configuration is very effective particularly in the case of a reflection-type liquid crystal display device, which has a solar cell as a photovoltaic element and performs display utilizing light from the external environment in a normal use condition of the liquid crystal display device, because the brightness in the external environment is sensed based on the amount of power generated by the solar cell to conduct power saving when the amount of power generation decreases to thereby attain the reduction in power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Such an embodiment will be described later in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The driving waveform of a liquid crystal display device in the fourth embodiment of the invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. This embodiment is characterized in that, after selection of scanning electrodes corresponding to the entire display region, a period is provided during which the electrodes are set at the floating potential, or that, after selection of scanning electrodes corresponding to a region where the display is updated within the display region, a period is provided during which the electrodes are set at the floating potential, in the power-saving mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device to which the driving waveform in this embodiment is applied is the same as that explained in the first embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a third standard selection signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a third standard data signal G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are the driving waveform in the standard mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Each of fields Tk(&plus;) and Tk(&minus;) is {fraction (1/120)} of a second, and the entire picture is rewritten at 120 Hz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> The third standard selection signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to select a first scanning electrode during a selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a voltage at V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> This third standard data signal G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies, in the Tk(&plus;) field, a voltage at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during periods for selecting odd-numbered scanning electrodes and a voltage at V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during periods for selecting even-numbered scanning electrodes. Accordingly, a large voltage is applied to the odd-numbered rows to write the dark display, and a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied to the even-numbered rows to hold the display as it is. In the Tk(&minus;) field, the voltage at V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is applied during the periods for selecting the odd-numbered scanning electrodes and the voltage at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied during the periods for selecting the even-numbered scanning electrodes. Accordingly, a voltage having a large absolute value is not applied to the odd-numbered rows to hold the display as it is, and a large voltage is applied to the even-numbered rows to produce the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the selection signals applied in Tk(&plus;) and Tk(&minus;) are of the same polarity to reduce the power consumption also when the standard signals are in use. When the bright display is written in the pixel, however, a period is also provided during which a signal of reversed polarity is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the number of scanning electrodes is <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the third standard selection signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is 17.4 microseconds as each of the Tk(&plus;) field and the Tk(&minus;) field is {fraction (1/120)} of a second, and further the difference between voltages V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 30 volts, which requires switching of a large voltage in a short time, resulting in a state of a large amount of electric power consumed by the circuit for generating the selection signal and the data signal, and the liquid crystal display panel. In other words, the liquid crystal display device is in a state of consuming a large amount of electric power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows a fifth power-saving selection signal H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a fifth power-saving data signal H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are the driving signal in the power-saving mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Each of fields Tl(&plus;) and Tl(&minus;) shall be a time period several tens of times longer than each of the fields Tk(&plus;) and Tk(&minus;) in the standard mode. This enables the voltage levels for use to be equal to or less than one-third Vi to V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the standard signal, so that Va to Ve are used. Further, after selection of scanning electrodes corresponding to the entire display region, a floating period <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, during which the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes are set at the floating potential, is provided as a liquid crystal layer charge memory period. Accordingly, each of the T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(&plus;) field and the T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(&minus;) field are called a write period for convenience, which does not mean that a writing is being performed at any scanning electrode all the time during the periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The fifth power-saving selection signal H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies the voltage at Va during a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode and the voltage at Vc during periods for selecting the other scanning electrodes. Further, the scanning electrode is set at the floating potential during the floating period <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> thereafter, the signal during the period being shown by a broken line (the same applying to waveform diagrams illustrated hereafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The fifth power-saving data signal H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies the voltage at Vd during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to thereby apply a large voltage to the liquid crystal layer at the pixel on the first row on the data electrode to which the signal is applied so as to bring the pixel into the dark display, and applies the voltage at Vc during the other power-saving selection periods to hold the display contents. The data electrode is set at the floating potential during the floating period <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The floating period <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is preferably provided after the display is written once until the display needs to be written next. The potentials of the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes are set at the floating potential when there is no updating of the display as described above, which makes it possible to stop the drive circuit in a state in which a predetermined display is presented, resulting in a possibility of almost no power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Further, the liquid crystal display device can also be driven in a power-saving mode in which the selection period is increased to be still several tens of times longer than that of the fifth power-saving selection signal H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a sixth power-saving selection signal J. In the sixth power-saving selection signal J, it becomes possible to use a voltage level still lower than that of the fifth power-saving selection signal H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the increase in the selection period. It is possible to use a voltage level still lower than that of the fifth power-saving data signal H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for a sixth power-saving data signal though the illustration thereof is omitted, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> In this power-saving mode, the display can be performed at a voltage level equal to or less than one-tenth that of the standard signal, which makes it possible to further reduce the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> As for the signals shown here, the selection signals applied in the fields Tl(&plus;) and Tm(&plus;), and Tl(&minus;) and Tm(&minus;) are of the same polarity to reduce the power consumption, but when the bright display is written in the pixel, a period is also provided during which a signal of reversed polarity is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Further, the example is explained here in which the floating period <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is provided after performance of a whole display rewriting that the scanning electrodes within the entire display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are sequentially selected to rewrite the display contents of all the pixel portions. However, when there is no need to update the display of the entire display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, it is also possible that the scanning electrodes corresponding to a display updating region that is a part of the display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are sequentially selected, and a data signal is applied to associated data electrodes to thereby perform a partial display rewriting, and thereafter the electrodes are set at the floating potential. In this event, the electrodes to which no signal is applied are preferably set at the floating potential. This can further reduce the power consumption. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The driving waveform of a liquid crystal display device in the fifth embodiment of the invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device to which the driving waveform in this embodiment is applied is the same as that explained in the first embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. Further, the driving waveforms in the standard mode explained in the first, second, and fourth embodiments may be appropriately selected for use for the driving waveform in the standard mode in this embodiment, and thus the explanation thereof is also omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a seventh power-saving selection signal K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a seventh power-saving data signal K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are the driving waveform in the power-saving mode in this embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> In this power-saving mode, in each of fields Tn(&plus;) and Tn(&minus;), a refresh period <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is provided before a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for applying the selection signal to each scanning electrode, and further, a floating period <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> for setting the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes at the floating potential is provided, as a liquid crystal layer charge memory period, after completion of selection of all the scanning electrodes within the display region. Accordingly, each of the Tn(&plus;) field and the Tn(&minus;) field is called a write period for convenience, which does not mean that a writing is being performed at any scanning electrode all the time during the periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is several ten of times or more longer than the selection period of the standard signal, and therefore a voltage level of the applied signal is equal to or less than a fraction of that of the standard signal. Further, each of the fields Tn(&plus;) and Tn(&minus;) shall be a period of 100 milliseconds to the order of a second, but they are not necessarily the same length, and further they can also be a very long period such as one minute, one hour, or one day when there is no need to rewrite the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The seventh power-saving selection signal K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> alternately applies voltages having large absolute values at potentials Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of opposite polarities plural times during the refresh period <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> which is provided before the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode, and a voltage at Va during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to select the scanning electrode, and the scanning electrode shall be set at the floating potential during the other periods. Since there is no need here to apply a voltage to the first scanning electrode except for the refresh period <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the first scanning electrode is set at the floating potential during not only the floating period <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> but also all the periods other than the refresh period <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The power-saving selection signals are also applied to the other scanning electrodes to select them in a time division manner, and in each of the signals, the scanning electrode shall be set at the floating potential during the periods other than the power-saving selection period corresponding to the scanning electrode to which the signal is applied and the refresh period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The seventh power-saving data signal K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> alternately applies voltages having large absolute values at Vr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Vr<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of opposite polarities during the refresh period corresponding to each scanning electrode, a voltage at Vd during the selection period <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and a voltage at Vc during the other selection periods. Further, the scanning electrode shall be set at the floating potential during the floating period <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> By applying such signals, positive and negative voltages having large absolute values are applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during the refresh period to cancel unbalance of charge, resulting in prevention of a decrease in the display quality such as an afterimage due to the unbalance of charge. A negative voltage is applied at the end of the refresh period to produce the bright display. During the selection period thereafter, the pixel, in which the voltage at Vd is applied to the data electrode thereof by the seventh power-saving data signal, can be brought into the dark display by applying a large positive voltage thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the same waveform is repeated in the fields Tk(&plus;) and Tk(&minus;) in the seventh power-saving selection signal, and it is also applicable to reverse both polarities of the seventh power-saving selection signal and the seventh power-saving data signal so as to bring the state after the refresh into the dark display and thereafter write the bright display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Further, the scanning electrode is set at the floating potential during the periods other than the power-saving selection period corresponding to the scanning electrode to which the seventh power-saving selection signal is applied and the refresh period, and thus if a large voltage is applied to the data electrode during the refresh period, there is no influence exerted on the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the floating period <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is provided after the completion of selection of all the scanning electrodes, the power consumption can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the example in which the positive and negative voltages having large absolute values are alternately applied during the refresh period is explained in this embodiment, and it is also applicable to apply a voltage larger than the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in displaying or a voltage which sweeps from a large voltage to a small voltage or from a large voltage to a small voltage and further to a smaller voltage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> This liquid crystal display device is a liquid crystal display device provided with a photovoltaic element as a power generating element, and is different from the liquid crystal display device explained in the first embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> only in this point and in that the diffusing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not provided, and thus the explanation except for these points is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view, corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing the enlarged cross section of a liquid crystal display panel thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> In this liquid crystal display device, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> that is a photovoltaic element is provided at a position overlapping the display portion on a glass <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> side (visible side) of the liquid crystal display panel, and is connected to a circuit board <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by a solar cell connecting FPC <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In this liquid crystal display device, electric power generated by the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is an energy supply, and a battery <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is used as a secondary battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, power generating portions <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are alternately provided on a solar cell substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> that is a transparent substrate. The power generating portions <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are arranged in stripes, and although the area of the power generating portion <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is shown large for convenience of illustration, the ratio of the area of the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to the total area of the power generating portions <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (the transmittance ratio) is actually 80%. Therefore, an observer can recognize display on the liquid crystal display panel through the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The power generating portion <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> has a configuration in which a semiconductor layer (power generating layer) <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> having a PIN junction constituted by a P-type, an I-type and an N-type amorphous silicon (a-Si) is provided between a first solar cell electrode <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and a second solar cell electrode <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> which are transparent conductive films respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Further, a protective layer <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> made of a polyimide resin is provided on the solar cell substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> to prevent the power generating portions <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> from deteriorating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Further, on the opposite side to the observer of the liquid crystal display panel, an auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> composed of an EL element is provided to form a transflective liquid crystal display device which can perform a reflection-type display using incident light from a use environment of the liquid crystal display device as a main light source and a transmission-type display by light emitted from the auxiliary light source. Since the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is not provided with the diffusing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the bright display of the reflection-type display becomes a mirror display. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> A first incident light <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> which is made incident on the power generating portion <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> of the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> from the external light source is used for photovoltaic generation and is not made incident on the liquid crystal display panel. A second incident light <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is made incident on the transmitting portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is reflected by a second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is a reflection-type polarizer and then made incident on the transmission axis of a first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to go out to the observer side as a first outgoing light <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the pixel is in the bright display due to a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In the case of the dark display, the light is reflected and then made incident on the absorption axis of the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to be absorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> In the case of the above bright display, an incident light <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is a part of light incident from the external light source is reflected by the second polarizer and then reaches the power generating portion <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> as an outgoing light <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which makes it possible to increase the amount of power generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, an auxiliary light source outgoing light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> outgoing from the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> outgoes to the observer side when the pixel is in the transmission state due to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the first and second polarizers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and outgoes to the observer side in a small amount in the absorption state. Therefore, the amount of light incident on the power generating element is small. Further, because of insufficient light emission efficiency of the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and power generation efficiency of the photovoltaic element, it has not been realized yet to update the display contents of the liquid crystal display panel by the power generated in the power generating element only by the light emission of the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display device in the status quo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> However, the power generation is performed by utilizing the main light source in the external environment, and the driving signal to be applied is selected such that the amount of power consumed by the liquid crystal display device becomes a value matching the amount of power generation, so as to attain a self-standing liquid crystal display device without necessity of being supplied with electric energy from other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> A method for selecting such a driving signal and a control circuit thereof are explained here using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the relationship between the amount of power generation in the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment and the response time and the power consumption of the liquid crystal display panel. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a system block diagram of the drive circuit of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> In the graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the horizontal axis represents elapse of time and the vertical axis represents the magnitude of each parameter at the point of time. A curved line <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> shows the amount of power generated by the solar cell, a curved line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> shows the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device, and a curved line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shows the frequency of updates of the display contents of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> When the amount of power generated by the solar cell and the amount of power remained in the storage battery (secondary battery) are large, the display contents of the liquid crystal display panel are intermittently rewritten during rewriting periods <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. During these periods, a signal at a relatively high voltage is applied to rewrite at a relatively high speed. A holding period <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, however, is provided between the rewriting periods <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, so that the scanning electrode and the data electrode are set at the same potential or at least one of them is set at the floating potential to hold the display contents by the memory effect of the liquid crystal layer during this period. It is preferable to select an appropriate signal from among the signals explained in the embodiments (hereafter, such an explanation including signals explained in the following embodiments (except those explained in twelfth and fourteenth embodiments)) for use as the driving signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Although the amount of power generated by the solar cell depends on the illumination of the use environment of the liquid crystal display device, in the case the liquid crystal display device is irradiated with about 1000 lux of light in a typical office environment so that assuming that the area of the photovoltaic element is 2 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the efficiency is about 20%, the amount of power generation is about 70 &mgr;W. Further, when the solar cell unit is provided on the observer side of the liquid crystal display panel, the amount of power generation is not so large, about 14 &mgr;W, because the area of the power generating portion <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is about 20% of the photovoltaic element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is very effective to use not the driving signal in the standard mode but the driving signal in the power-saving mode having a selection period of each scanning electrode of about 1 millisecond also during the rewriting periods <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> so as to decrease the voltage required for the optical change in the liquid crystal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> When the use environment of the liquid crystal display device becomes dark to greatly decrease the amount of power generated by the solar cell unit (during a period <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>), it is also necessary to greatly decrease the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. Accordingly, in such a state, the updating of the display contents is stopped and the scanning electrode and the data electrode are set at the same potential or at the floating potential to hold the display contents, thereby greatly reducing the power consumption without deleting the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Further, when the display contents need to be updated in such a state, the signals are applied only to the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes corresponding to the updating region and further an update is performed extremely slowly with the selection period being about one second per one electrode so as to suppress the signal voltages low for control of the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The visibility of the liquid crystal display panel is lowered in the state of a dark use environment of the liquid crystal display device, and thus the display contents do not need to be updated in serial, so that the liquid crystal display device is usable even with a minimum update. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a display &ldquo;Energy management ON&rdquo; is performed at a part of the display as a notice of the display contents being updated at a low speed, and this display is made possible with almost no power consumption by holding the display once written without new application of a signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> When the use environment of the liquid crystal display device becomes bright to increase the amount of power generated by the solar cell (during a period <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>), the battery remaining amount of the secondary battery is detected. When the remaining amount is large, the display contents are updated by signals having a large potential difference at a high speed (about a millisecond per scanning electrode). When the remaining amount is small, the display contents are updated by signals having a relatively small potential difference at an intermediate speed (about 100 milliseconds per scanning electrode) to suppress the power consumption low, thereby increasing the battery remaining amount. In the example shown here, the update of the display contents is performed by display rewriting at an intermediate speed during a period <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> since the battery remaining amount is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Such switching of the driving signal is performed by a circuit shown in a block diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> This circuit includes a reference clock oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, a synchronization separation circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a vertical synchronization circuit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, a horizontal synchronization circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, a display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, a selection signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a data signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, a voltage detection circuit <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, a battery remaining amount detection circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, a charging voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, a display data generation circuit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, a counter block <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, a power-saving mode switching block <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, and a display refresh block <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> A signal of the reference clock oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is divided to the vertical synchronization circuit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and the horizontal synchronization circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> via the synchronization separation circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and the vertical synchronization circuit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and the horizontal synchronization circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> input a vertical synchronization signal and a horizontal synchronization signal to the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the power generating condition of a power generating means <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> that is the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is detected by the voltage detection circuit <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. The generated energy from the solar cell charges a secondary battery <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> by means of the voltage detection circuit <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> through the charging voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. Further, the battery remaining amount detection circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> detects the conditions of the voltage detection circuit <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and the secondary battery <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>, and sends a signal to the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> The display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is constituted by a selection signal frequency decision circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, a data signal frequency decision circuit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, a partial display rewriting period decision circuit <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, and a voltage amplitude decision circuit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, and decides the mode and waveforms of the selection signal and the data signal to be applied in accordance with the conditions of the voltage detection circuit <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and the secondary battery <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> inputted from the battery remaining amount detection circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> and display data inputted from the display data generation circuit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Then, predetermined signals are transferred to the selection signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the data signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, so that the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is driven by the selection signal and the data signal generated by these circuits to perform display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The signal waveform to be applied to the liquid crystal display panel is divided into the rewriting period, the holding period, the refresh period, the floating period and the like to control the voltage and time by the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, which makes it possible to greatly reduce the power consumption of the display by the liquid crystal display panel. Further, the amount of power generated by the power generating means <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the remaining amount of the secondary battery <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> are detected to control the signal waveform by the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, which makes it possible to continue the display even if the amount of power generation decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Further, the power-saving mode switching block <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> forcedly sets the power-saving mode or the standard mode in the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. The power-saving mode includes a plurality of modes, so that the signal waveforms explained in the embodiments are controlled by the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. Further, it is also possible to set the cycle of updates of the display by the display refresh block <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> It is also possible that signals from the power-saving mode switching block <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and the display refresh block <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> are transferred to the counter block <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, and the counter block measures the operating time thereof and controls the power-saving mode switching block <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, the display refresh block <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> and the display management block <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> to perform the power-saving mode switching or the refresh operation at a previously set time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> When the power-saving mode switching button <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> or the display refresh button <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are pushed, the signals thereof are inputted into the power-saving mode switching block <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> or the display refresh block <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> respectively, so that it is also possible to switch the mode of the display signal (the power-saving mode or the like) or to perform the display refresh operation by the user operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> By conducting the above-described driving control, the power consumption can be reduced to realize a self-standing liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> It is naturally possible to use a thermal power generating element which generates power utilizing temperature difference as a power generating element other than the solar cell or a method of converting kinetic energy into electric energy in the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. In addition, for example, when the liquid crystal display device is a fixed and self-standing type, there is a method of generating temperature difference utilizing ventilation around the liquid crystal display device or the like, but the use of the photovoltaic element is the most effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The use of the photovoltaic element is effective in reducing the thickness and weight, and more particularly, the provision of the power generating element on the observer side of the liquid crystal display panel can increase the area of the power generating element and eliminate the necessity of consideration given to the position of the power generating element. As for the shape of the power generating element, a transmission-type power generating element is effective in which transparent portions and power generating portions are alternately arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Further, the use of a reflection-type polarizer for the polarizer constituting the liquid crystal display panel enables the reflectance from the liquid crystal display panel side to increase and a part of the reflected light to be made incident on the solar cell, resulting in efficient power generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that a circuit made by removing the power generating means <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, the voltage detection circuit <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, and the charging voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> from the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is applicable to the liquid crystal display device explained in the first embodiment. Furthermore, this circuit is also applicable to liquid crystal display devices of embodiments described below. The circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> can be applied, as it is, to modifications of those liquid crystal display devices provided with power generating elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device of the seventh embodiment of this invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view, corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, of a liquid crystal display panel of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, and the same numerals are assigned to portions corresponding to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> This liquid crystal display device is the same as the liquid crystal display device of the sixth embodiment explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> except that a solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is provided on a first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by bonding thereto, that a diffusing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided between a second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, that a cold-cathode tube <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is used for an auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and that a color layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is provided between the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second polarizer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and thus the explanation except for these points is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> In the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, as for power generating portions <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> arranged in stripes, the ratio of the area of the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to the total area of the power generating portions <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (the transmittance ratio) is set 70%. Even in such a configuration, it is possible to recognize the display on the liquid crystal display panel through the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> as in the sixth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, there occurs no reflection at interfaces between the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a gap therebetween because the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is provided bonded to the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with an acrylic adhesive, resulting in improvement of the display quality. Further, it becomes easy to hold the solar cell unit, resulting in a structure with high strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the diffusing layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided to suppress glare of display in the reflection display, so that the bright display in the reflection display becomes a white display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in this embodiment, the auxiliary light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is constituted by the cold-cathode tube <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that is a light emitting means, a lamp house <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, a scattering plate (not shown), and the color layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. An EL plate, however, may be used as in the sixth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Also with the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, the power generation is performed by utilizing the main light source in the external environment, and the driving signal to be applied is selected such that the amount of power consumed by the liquid crystal display device becomes a value matching the amount of power generation, which enables to attain a self-standing liquid crystal display device without necessity of being supplied with electric energy from other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The control thereof can be conducted in the same manner as that explained in the sixth embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the solar cell unit and the liquid crystal display device explained here are only examples, and it is also preferable, for example, to dispose the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> between the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or on a face on the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> side of the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, it is also possible to form the first polarizer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with the solar cell unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to serve as both of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Such a change is also applicable to the liquid crystal display device of the sixth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Eighth Embodiment: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device of the eighth embodiment of this invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a plan view showing an external appearance of a digital timepiece using the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, this timepiece <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> has a display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> composed of the same liquid crystal display panel as that explained in the sixth or the seventh embodiment, and a panel cover portion <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> provided therearound. The display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has a character display portion <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, a schedule display portion <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, a menu display portion <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, and a time display portion <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> to display a plurality of kinds of information. Further, the character display portion <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> has a first character display <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> for displaying fish and a second and a third character display <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> for displaying polka dots. Furthermore, the time display portion <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> has a partial display switching portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Moreover, this timepiece <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, which is provided with a solar cell unit through the illustration thereof is omitted, has a power generating function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> By the way, some of the display contents of the display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> need to be updated in serial and the others have only to be displayed as is without update of the display for a fixed time. More specifically, for example, the character display portion <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> has no problem as information even if it continues the same display for days for a reduction in power consumption. In the schedule display portion <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, if it is capable of displaying much information, the display thereof does not need to be updated in several hours or several days, or in several months in some cases. Furthermore, in the menu display portion <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, there is no need to update the display in particular if all of the information content of menu is always being displayed. In the time display portion <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, however, the display needs to be updated every minute if it has a minute display portion and every second if it has a second display portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the timepiece <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, frequent updates of the display are required only for the time display portion <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, in which if the display is updated every minute at the portion which performs the minute display, every hour at the portion which performs the hour display, and every half-day at the portion which performs the AM/PM display, each display has only to be held as is during other times. Accordingly, only when there occurs necessity to update the above display, the driving signal is applied to scanning electrodes and signal electrodes corresponding to a region which needs to be updated, and further a driving signal having a long selection period in the power-saving mode is used to decrease the driving voltage, which enables a display with a very low power consumption, which enables to attain a self-standing liquid crystal display device using a power generating element with a small amount of power generation. </paragraph>

Further, the driving waveforms in the standard mode explained in the first, second, and fourth embodiments may be appropriately selected for use for the driving waveform in the standard mode in this embodiment, and thus the explanation thereof is also omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> shows an eighth power-saving selection signal L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an eighth power-saving data signal L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is a composite waveform of them and a waveform showing a voltage to be applied to a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other, which are the driving waveform in the power-saving mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, different signals are applied in a To(&plus;) field and in a To(&minus;) field. During periods in the To(&plus;) field, the eighth power-saving selection signal L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at Va during a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode and a voltage at Vc during the other periods. The eighth power-saving data signal L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at Vd during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the voltage at Vc during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a voltage at Vfl larger than Va is applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixel in a portion where the electrodes, to which these signals are applied, oppose each other, so that the pixel becomes the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> As for periods in the To(&minus;) field, the power-saving selection period for selecting one scanning electrode has a length three times the period in the To(&plus;) field. The eighth power-saving selection signal L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially applies voltages at three levels Ve, Vc and Va for equal time during a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode. The voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods. The eighth power-saving data signal L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sequentially applies voltages at three levels Vb, Vc and Vd for equal time during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, a negative voltage, a zero voltage, and a positive voltage are applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the pixel in the portion where the electrodes, to which these signals are applied, oppose each other. A large positive voltage is applied the last time, so that the pixel becomes the dark display. The absolute values of the voltages applied here are the same as those applied during the periods in the To(&plus;) field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> The voltages of different polarities are sequentially applied to the liquid crystal layer as described above to cancel unbalance of charge in the liquid crystal layer. Since an unbalance of charge occurs in the liquid crystal layer when the To(&plus;) field is repeated for a long time, the To(&minus;) field is sometimes provided to cancel this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the signal waveforms shown here are waveforms for writing the dark display, and thus a selection signal and a data signal of reversed polarities are used to write the bright display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> As has been described, the eighth power-saving selection signal and the eighth power-saving data signal are used to reduce the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device so as to prevent unbalance of the charge in the liquid crystal layer. Further, the signal waveforms and the selection period are made different in the To(&plus;) field and in the To(&minus;) field, which enables driving at the same voltage level, resulting in a simple circuit system of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device to which the driving waveform in this embodiment is applied is the same as that explained in the first embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows fourth standard selection signals M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a fourth standard data signal M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are the driving waveform in the standard mode of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The tenth embodiment is characterized in that refresh periods <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> are provided at once for each scanning electrode in each of fields Tp(&plus;) and Tp(&minus;) to prevent unbalance of charge in a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in display in the standard mode. This refresh period <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> shall be provided immediately before a selection period <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> The fourth standard selection signal M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a selection signal to be applied to the first scanning electrode, and the fourth standard selection signal M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a selection signal to be applied to the second scanning electrode. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, either signal alternately applies voltages at V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during the refresh period <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. The same voltages are applied to other scanning electrodes. On the other hand, the fourth standard data signal M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> alternately applies voltages at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to all the data electrodes during the refresh period <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a positive voltage (V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and a negative voltage (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) which have large absolute values are alternately applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at all the pixels within the display region during the refresh period <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to cancel unbalance of charge and ion component in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as well as to refresh the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Since the voltages are alternately applied at high frequencies during the refresh period <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the voltage at VS and the voltage at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are applied to the scanning electrodes and the data electrodes respectively at the end of the refresh periods <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and after they are stabilized, the selection period <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> The display during each selection period is the same as that in the standard mode of the first embodiment explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> except that the applied voltages of the fourth standard data signal are not at V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> but at V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Signal waveforms used in the power-saving mode are explained next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows ninth power-saving selection signals N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and ninth power-saving data signals N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which are the driving waveform in the power-saving mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Each of fields Tq(&plus;) and Tq(&minus;) and the power-saving selection period for selecting each scanning electrode here is several hundreds of times or more longer than that in the standard mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, and in addition, the refresh period <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is not provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> The ninth power-saving selection signal N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the ninth power-saving data signal N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are examples of signals for writing the dark display into a pixel, so that a large positive voltage (Va&minus;Vd) is applied to the liquid crystal layer at the pixel to bring the pixel into the dark display. When the ninth power-saving data signal N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> applies Vc, the display does not change and is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> The ninth power-saving selection signal N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the ninth power-saving data signal N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are examples of signals for writing the bright display into a pixel, so that a negative voltage (Ve&minus;Vb) having a large absolute value is applied to the liquid crystal layer at the pixel to bring the pixel into the bright display. When the ninth power-saving data signal N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> applies Vc, the display does not change and is held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> It is applicable to repeatedly apply the same signal of these signals or to appropriately combine them for rewriting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device is driven with the signals in the standard mode and the signals in the power-saving mode of this embodiment appropriately switched, thereby attaining a great reduction in power consumption when the display is not frequently updated. Further the picture is sometimes rewritten at a low voltage and a low speed, which makes it possible to prevent deterioration in the display quality also when a liquid crystal layer with an insufficient memory property is used for the liquid crystal layer. Furthermore, it becomes possible that the unbalance of ions and the like in the liquid crystal layer due to a fixed display in the power-saving mode for a long time is cancelled by the refresh period provided in the standard mode, which enables the display to be updated at a high speed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device to which the driving waveform in this embodiment is applied is the same as that explained in the first embodiment using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. Further, the driving waveforms in the standard mode explained in the embodiments may be appropriately selected for use for the driving waveform in the standard mode in this embodiment, and thus the explanation thereof is also omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows a tenth power-saving selection signal P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a tenth power-saving data signal P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is a composite waveform of them and a waveform showing a voltage to be applied to a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other, which are the driving waveform in the power-saving mode in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is characterized in that a single voltage is applied during each selection period in a Tr(&plus;) field to perform display and a Tr(&minus;) field is used as a refresh period in which positive and negative voltages having large absolute values are alternately applied during each selection period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> In the Tr(&plus;) field, the tenth power-saving selection signal P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies a voltage at Va during a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode to select the scanning electrode, and applies a voltage at Vc during the other periods. The tenth power-saving data signal P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a data signal for bringing only the pixel on the first row on the data electrode, to which the signal is applied, into the dark display and applies a voltage at Vd during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and the voltage at Vc during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> becomes Vf<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is a large positive voltage, so that the pixel becomes the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> In the Tr(&minus;) field, the tenth power-saving selection signal P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially applies Va<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is a voltage higher than Va and Ve<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is a voltage lower than Ve during a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> for selecting the first scanning electrode. The voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods. The tenth power-saving data signal P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sequentially applies the voltages at Va and Ve to all the data electrodes during all the power-saving selection periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> As a result, during the periods in the Tr(&minus;) field, the positive and negative voltages Vf<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and Vf<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having large absolute values are sequentially applied to the liquid crystal layer at all the pixels on the scanning electrode to cancel the unbalance of ions and the like in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and thus the periods serve as refresh periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> The display is performed using the Tr(&plus;) field, and the Tr(&minus;) field is used from once every several tens of times to once every several thousands of times to cancel the unbalance of ions and the like to thereby refresh the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the signals in the Tr(&plus;) field here shown in the figure are also signals for writing the dark display, and thus when the bright display is written, signals of reversed polarities are used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device of the twelfth embodiment of this invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is a plan view showing a liquid crystal display panel of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment with a pixel portion and the surroundings enlarged, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is an equivalent circuit diagram showing its pixel portion, switching element, and storage element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> The twelfth embodiment is characterized in that each pixel portion has a three-terminal type thin film transistor (TFT) as a switching element which is connected in series to a liquid crystal layer constituting the pixel portion, and further, in that a storage element is provided which is connected in series to the switching element and connected in parallel to the liquid crystal layer constituting the pixel portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is different from the liquid crystal display device in the first embodiment explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> only in the configuration of electrodes, and thus the explanation except for this point is omitted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, on a first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in stripes are provided and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> connected to the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided for every pixel. A gate insulating film (not shown) is provided on each gate electrode <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, and a polysilicon (p-Si) film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is provided on the gate insulating film. A source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> connected to a signal electrode <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> is provided on the polysilicon film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, and a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is connected to a drain electrode <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> which is provided to have a predetermined gap with the source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. This pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is provided for every isolated region surrounded by the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the signal electrodes <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> Polysilicon films (not shown) containing impurity ions are provided between the polysilicon film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, and between the polysilicon film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the drain electrode <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight>, respectively. These source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, drain electrode <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight>, gate electrode <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, gate insulating film, and polysilicon film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> form a three-terminal type TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the intersection of the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the signal electrode <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> for every pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> The insulating film is provided at least between the signal electrode <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> and the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to prevent these electrodes from conducting to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> On the second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a data electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided over the entire face of a display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and a portion where the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and the data electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> oppose each other with a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> sandwiched therebetween becomes a pixel portion, so that a voltage applied to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> via the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> induces an optical change in the liquid crystal layer to perform display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> Further, a storing electrode <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is provided on the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> through a storing insulating film (not shown). The pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, the storing insulating film, and the storing electrode <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> form a storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. A predetermined potential is applied to the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> through the storing electrode <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> at the outer periphery of the display region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display device. This forms the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> which is connected in parallel to a liquid crystal capacitance constituted by the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> The provision of the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> makes it possible to store charge in a short time in the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> from the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that is the switching element and to slowly supply the charge (electric current) to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that the provision becomes effective when the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is great in viscosity or slow in response. Furthermore, it is also possible to supply charge again from the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> when a tiny amount of charge is internally consumed from the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and thus the provision is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the consumption of the charge can be reduced by providing a switching element with a high resistance at the pixel portion also when the pixel portion is set at the floating from an external circuit during a liquid crystal layer charge memory period, and thus the provision is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> By the way, it is impossible to use the driving signals explained in the embodiments so far, as they are, to drive the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> First of all, since the selection signal is a signal for conducting the TFT, selection has to be conducted by a signal at a positive potential. In addition, the data electrode shall be at the ground potential at all times. Then, a signal corresponding to a composite waveform of the selection signal and the data signal is applied to the signal electrode <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> during each selection period, whereby the same voltages as those in the embodiments so far can be applied to the liquid crystal layer. The signals explained in the embodiments are modified for use as described above, which enables to drive the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> Examples of such signal waveforms are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows waveforms made by modifying the waveforms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> to use them to drive the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> Each of Ti(&plus;) field and Ti(&minus;) field is <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> second which is a period 120 times each of the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field in the case of the standard mode. Accordingly, the selection period for selecting each scanning electrode is also a period 120 times that in the standard mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> A waveform Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is a scanning signal to be applied to the first scanning electrode, that is, a signal waveform to be applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> of the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> connected to the scanning electrode. Further, it is a signal waveform which turns ON and OFF the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A voltage at Vga is applied at a timing of turning ON and a voltage at Vc is applied during the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> A waveform Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a signal to be applied to the data electrode, a signal waveform for applying a zero voltage at Vc at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Waveforms Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are signals to be applied to the signal electrode, that is, signal waveforms to be applied to the source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> of the TFT. Further, they are signals which turn ON and OFF the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a signal waveform which writes the dark display of ON into the pixel on the first row and causes the others to hold the display without update. Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a signal waveform which causes only the pixel on the first row to repeat the dark display of ON and the bright display of OFF every field Ti(&plus;) and Ti(&minus;) and the others to hold the display without update. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> These signals apply a large positive voltage Vad (&equals;Va&minus;Vd) to the source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> when the TFT is in the ON state, that is, in a low resistance state to charge the liquid crystal layer and the storage element with charge. The storage element is sufficiently charged, which makes it possible to turn OFF the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a short time and thereafter to turn ON the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> spending time. Therefore, the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> slowly turns ON and OFF as compared to the standard frequency to be able to sufficiently charge the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> at a low voltage. Further, also when the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is slow in response and thus requires a long selection period, the operating time of the circuit can be decreased by the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, so as to reduce the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a large negative voltage Ved (&equals;Ve&minus;Vb) is applied to the source electrode <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> when the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is in the ON state, that is, in a low resistance state, which makes it possible to turn the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the OFF state. The storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is sufficiently charged, which makes it possible to turn OFF the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a short time and thereafter to turn OFF the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> spending time. Therefore, the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> slowly turns ON and OFF as compared to the standard frequency to be able to sufficiently charge the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> at a low voltage. Further, also when the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is slow in response and thus requires a long selection period, the operating time of the circuit can be decreased by the TFT <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, so as to reduce the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although the example without providing a power generating means has been explained in this embodiment, a power generating means may be provided as in the liquid crystal display devices explained in the sixth embodiment and the seventh embodiment to perform driving by the energy supplied therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> Thirteenth Embodiment: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device of the thirteenth embodiment of this invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> is a plane view showing a liquid crystal display panel of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment with a pixel portion and the surroundings enlarged, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> is an equivalent circuit diagram showing its pixel portion, switching element, and storage element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> The thirteenth embodiment is characterized in that each pixel portion has a two-terminal type thin film PIN diode (TFD) composed of an amorphous silicon (a-Si) film as a switching element which is connected in series to a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> constituting the pixel portion, and further, in that a storage element is provided which is connected in series to the switching element and connected in parallel to the liquid crystal layer constituting the pixel portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is different from the liquid crystal display device in the first embodiment explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> only in the configuration of electrodes, and thus the explanation except for this point is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows a state of a liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> viewed from a first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side with the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> removed therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, on the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> composed of a transparent conductive film are provided in stripes. On a second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> composed of a transparent conductive film, a first diode lower electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> connected to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, and an isolated second diode lower electrode <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are provided for every pixel. Amorphous silicon (a-Si) films <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which are separated and have PIN connections, are provided on the first and second diode lower electrodes <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, respectively. The P-type amorphous silicon provided on the second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> uses a film low in impurity concentration of boron (B) and high in resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> On the amorphous silicon films <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a first diode upper electrode <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and a second diode upper electrode <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> are provided respectively. Data electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in stripes are also provided here, and the first diode upper electrode <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is provided connected to a data electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> Further, since the data electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided to partially overlap the second diode lower electrode <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, they conduct to each other, and since the second diode upper electrode <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is provided to partially overlap the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, they conduct to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> These first diode lower electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and first diode upper electrode <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> form a first diode <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second diode lower electrode <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and second diode upper electrode <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> form a second diode <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> According to the above configuration, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the switching element in which the first and second diodes <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are connected in ring form is arranged between the data electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. The PIN diode composed of the amorphous silicon film is effective in flowing a large electric current at a low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a storing electrode <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is provided through a storing insulating film (not shown) on the second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, the storing insulating film, and the storing electrode <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> form a storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. A predetermined potential is applied to the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> through the storing electrode <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> at the outer periphery of the display region of the liquid crystal display device. This forms the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> connected in parallel to a liquid crystal capacitance constituted by the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> It is possible to drive the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment using the driving waveforms explained in the embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> The provision of the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> makes it possible to store charge in the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> from the TFD that is the switching element in a short time and to slowly supply the charge (electric current) to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that the provision becomes effective when the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is great in viscosity or slow in response. Furthermore, it is also possible to supply charge again from the storing capacitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> when a tiny amount of charge is internally consumed from the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and thus the provision is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the provision of a switching element with a high resistance at the pixel portion enables a reduction in the consumption of charge also when the pixel portion is set at the floating from an external circuit during a liquid crystal layer charge memory period, and thus the provision is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> It is possible to apply the driving waveforms explained in the embodiments except the twelfth embodiment to the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although the example without providing a power generating means has been explained in this embodiment, a power generating means may be provided as in the liquid crystal display devices explained in the sixth embodiment and the seventh embodiment to perform driving by the energy supplied therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Fourteenth Embodiment: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> Waveforms for driving a liquid crystal display device of the fourteenth embodiment of the invention and waveforms for driving a liquid crystal display panel thereof are explained next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is characterized in that an antiferroelectric liquid crystal, which has a short memory time as compared to the ferroelectric liquid crystal but is capable of AC drive, is used for a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This liquid crystal display device is the same as that of the first embodiment explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> except this point, and thus the explanation except for this point is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> First of all, the characteristics of the antiferroelectric liquid crystal are explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> are graphs showing the relationship between the applied voltage and the brightness of display when the driving signals in the standard mode and in the power-saving mode are applied to the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment respectively, and are graphs corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, the brightness of display is indicated on the vertical axis and the applied voltage is indicated on the horizontal axis. The right side of the graph shows a state of the applied voltage to the liquid crystal layer being positive polarity and the left side shows a state of the applied voltage being negative polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, the pixel is in a dark state (dark display) with the applied voltage being zero in the standard mode in which a display region is rewritten once at a frequency of typically used video rate (30 Hz) or higher. When a voltage of positive polarity is applied from this state, the brightness of display increases along a curved line <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, and a large voltage of positive polarity is applied to bring the pixel into a bright state (bright display). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, when the applied voltage is decreased from this bright display state, the brightness of display decreases along a curved line <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. When the applied voltage is decreased here to zero voltage, the display becomes dark, but the brightness of the bright display is held even if the voltage is decreased to some extent. In other words, the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> composed of an antiferroelectric liquid crystal also has the memory property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when a negative voltage is applied from a state of the applied voltage being zero, the brightness of display increases along a curved line <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and when a voltage having a large absolute value of negative polarity is applied, the display becomes bright. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, when the applied voltage is decreased in absolute value keeping negative polarity from this bright display state, the brightness of display decreases along a curved line <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. When the absolute value of the applied voltage is decreased here to zero, the display becomes dark, but the brightness of the bright display is held even if the absolute value of the voltage is decreased to some extent. In other words, the liquid crystal layer has the same memory property also in the negative polarity as that in the case of positive polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> More specifically, once a voltage having a large absolute value is applied to bring the pixel into the bright display, predetermined brightness can be held thereafter by applying a holding voltage having a small absolute value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> In such a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the memory property, even a small voltage can create a great optical change as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> by applying the voltage for a period several tens of times or 1000 times or longer than that in the standard selection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> In the case of applying the voltage for a long time, when a voltage of positive polarity is applied from the state of the applied voltage being zero, the brightness of display changes as shown by a curved line <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Then, when the applied voltage is decreased from the state of the bright display by the voltage of positive polarity, the brightness of display changes as shown by a curved line <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> Further, when a voltage of negative polarity is applied from a state of the applied voltage being zero, the brightness of display changes as shown by a curved line <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. Then, when the applied voltage is decreased in absolute value keeping negative polarity from the bright display state by the voltage of negative polarity, the brightness of display changes as shown by a curved line <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> In other words, such a display also has the memory property, and once a voltage having a somewhat large absolute value is applied to bring the pixel into the bright display, predetermined brightness can be held thereafter by applying a holding voltage having a smaller absolute value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> However, since the period for applying a signal to one electrode is long, different from the display in the standard mode, the bright and dark displays can be switched by applying a voltage far smaller than that in the standard mode, resulting in reduced power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, a power-saving mode is provided which has a selection period for selecting each electrode of 100 times to 1000 times or more longer than that in the standard mode using such characteristics, and the display is performed in the power-saving mode when there is no need to switch the display in a high speed, which enables to realize a liquid crystal display device having a very low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> Since the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is different from the liquid crystal display devices explained in the embodiments so far in relationship between the applied voltage and the brightness of display, the driving signals explained in the embodiments cannot be applied thereto. Hence, signals for driving the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment are explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> shows a fifth standard selection signal R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a fifth standard data signal R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a waveform R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is a composite waveform of them and shows a voltage to be applied to a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other, which are the driving waveform in the standard mode of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> In each standard signal of this embodiment, signals of positive and negative polarities are switched every field of Tf(&plus;) and Tf(&minus;) to thereby apply an alternating current waveform. Each write period shall be {fraction (1/120)} of a second (about 8 milliseconds) to prevent flicker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> The fifth standard selection signal R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies, in the Tf(&plus;) field, a voltage at V<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> during a selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that is a period for selecting the first scanning electrode to select the first scanning electrode, and a voltage at V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during the other periods to hold the display. In the Tf(&minus;) field, a voltage at V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is applied during the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to select the first scanning electrode, and a voltage at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied during the other periods to hold the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> The fifth standard selection signal to be applied to a scanning electrode other than the first one applies a voltage at V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> until the selection period for selecting the scanning electrode to hold the display in the Tf(&plus;) field, and applies a voltage at V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> until the selection period for selecting the scanning electrode to hold the display in the Tf(&minus;) field. The reason is that the display needs to be held by a voltage having the same polarity as that of the voltage which has performed write. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> The fifth standard data signal R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a signal example which brings the pixels on odd-numbered rows into the bright display and the pixels on even numbered rows into the dark display. In the Tf(&plus;) field, a voltage at V<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the bright display, and a voltage at V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the dark display. In the Tf(&minus;) field, a voltage at V<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the bright display, and the voltage at V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, voltages having large absolute values V<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are applied in the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field respectively as shown by R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the selection period for bringing the pixel into the bright display. Further, the bright display by the voltage at V<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is held by applying a voltage of V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (&lt;V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) to V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (&gt;V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and the bright display by the voltage at V<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held by applying a voltage of V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (&lt;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (&gt;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). During the selection period for bringing the pixel into the dark display, the voltages at V<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are applied in the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> Further, voltages which are symmetrical with respect to V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and have the same absolute value are applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the Tf(&plus;) field and the Tf(&minus;) field to prevent a direct current component from being applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> The driving waveform in the power-saving mode that is a feature of the invention is explained next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> shows an eleventh power-saving selection signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an eleventh power-saving data signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a waveform S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is a composite waveform of them and shows a voltage to be applied to a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a portion where the scanning electrode and the data electrode oppose each other, which are the driving waveform in the power-saving mode of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> is also the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the horizontal axis is a time axis <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the vertical axis represents voltage, and the middle of the scale set for each waveform shows a voltage of 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> Each of fields Ts(&plus;) and Ts(&minus;) is, however, a time period 1000 times longer than that of each of the fields Tf(&plus;) and Tf(&minus;) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. Therefore, a power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> that is a period for selecting the first scanning electrode is also a period having a length 1000 times the selection period <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> The eleventh power-saving selection period S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> applies, in the Ts(&plus;) field, a voltage at Vaa during the power-saving selection period <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to select the first scanning electrode, and applies a voltage at Vb during the other periods to hold the display. In the Ts(&minus;) field, a voltage at Vee is applied during the selection period <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to select the first scanning electrode, and a voltage at Vd is applied during the other periods to hold the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> The eleventh power-saving selection signal to be applied to a scanning electrode other than the first one applies the voltage at Vd until the selection period for selecting the scanning electrode to hold the display in the Ts(&plus;) field, and applies the voltage at Vb until the period for selecting the scanning electrode to hold the display in the Ts(&minus;) field. The reason is that the display needs to be held by a voltage having the same polarity as that of the voltage which has performed write. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> The eleventh power-saving data signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a signal example which brings the pixels on odd-numbered rows into the bright display and the pixels on even-numbered rows into the dark display. In the Ts(&plus;) field, a voltage at Vdd is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the bright display, and a voltage at Vc is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the dark display. In the Ts(&minus;) field, a voltage at Vbb is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the bright display, and the voltage at Vc is applied during a selection period for selecting the scanning electrode on the row to be brought into the dark display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, voltages having relatively large absolute values Vab and Veb are applied in the Ts(&plus;) field and the Ts(&minus;) field, respectively, as shown by S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during the selection period for bringing the pixel into the bright display. Further, the bright display by the voltage at Vab is held by applying a voltage of Vb&minus;Vbb (&lt;Vb) to Vb&minus;Vdd (&gt;Vb), and the bright display by the voltage at Veb is held by applying a voltage of Vd&minus;Vbb (&lt;Vd) to Vd&minus;Vdd (&gt;Vd). During the selection period for bringing the pixel into the dark display, the voltages at Vaa and Vee are applied in the Ts(&plus;) field and the Ts(&minus;) field respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> Further, the voltages which are symmetrical with respect to Vc and have the same absolute value are applied to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the Ts(&plus;) field and the Ts(&minus;) field to prevent a direct current component from being applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> Since each application period (power-saving selection period) is 1000 times as long as that in the standard mode, the potential difference between the applied potentials Vaa and Vee used for the eleventh power-saving selection signal can be reduced to about one-fifth the potential difference between V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fifth standard selection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a range of the applied voltage of the eleventh power-saving data signal from Vbb to Vdd and a range of the applied voltage to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from Vab to Veb can also be reduced to about one-fifth each potential used in the standard mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> As described above, the selection period is increased to be about 1000 times as long as the standard selection period, which makes it possible to reduce the driving voltage to about several volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> The display is performed by using the driving signal in the standard mode when the display needs to be updated frequently and quickly, and using the driving signal in the power-saving mode when the display has only to be updated slowly, thereby realizing a liquid crystal display device with a low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment can be driven by an alternating current waveform because the antiferroelectric liquid crystal is employed for the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that unbalance of charge and the like is never accumulated in the liquid crystal layer without providing the refresh period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> Further, in each write period, a period for holding the display by continuing the application of the holding voltage may be provided after completion of selection of all the scanning electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> Further, although the example without providing a power generating means has been explained in this embodiment, a power generating means may be provided as in the liquid crystal display devices explained in the sixth embodiment and the seventh embodiment to perform driving by the energy supplied therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Fifteenth Embodiment: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display device of the fifteenth embodiment of the invention is explained next using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> is a plan view showing only electrodes and alignment films of the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing the arrangement of liquid crystal molecules in a liquid crystal display panel of the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is different from the liquid crystal display device in the first embodiment explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> only in that the polarizers and the diffusing layer are not used and in the configuration of the alignment films and the electrodes, and thus the explanation except for these points is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is characterized in that alignment films of four types of alignment directions are arranged in mosaic form to cause the alignment directions of the liquid crystal molecules to be nonuniform and that a projecting portion is provided at the scanning electrode in such a manner to shift in the lateral direction in the figure from an opposing data electrode to form a pixel portion so as to cause a lateral electric field at the application of voltage. This configuration brings about a structure in which an application of voltage to the liquid crystal layer produces scattering by minute domains of the liquid crystal layer, which enables display in a scattering state and a transmission state without using the polarizer and the diffusing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in stripes provided on a first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display device are provided with predetermined gap portions <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> in stripes. Portions sandwiched between the gap portions <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> become projecting portions <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, and the portions of the projecting portions <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> become pixel portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> Further, data electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided on a second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a direction perpendicular to the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at positions opposing the gap portions <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> to the extent that they may slightly overlap the projecting portions <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> On the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> including the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a first alignment region <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, a second alignment region <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, a third alignment region <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, and a fourth alignment region <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> for alignment in directions different by <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> degrees are provided as an alignment film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> composed of a silicon oxide (SiOx) film. In this embodiment, the size of each alignment region shall be an area of about two pixels in a rectangular, and four alignment regions shall be provided arranged in mosaic form, but the size and arrangement are not limited to these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> The first alignment region <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is formed in such a manner that a mask having an opening at a portion corresponding to the alignment region is disposed on the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the silicon oxide film (SiO) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is evaporated in a slanting direction of the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the vacuum evaporation method. The above evaporation is repeatedly performed four times with the first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rotated by 90 degrees using masks for forming the alignment regions so as to form the first to the fourth alignment region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> The above alignment regions in four directions are similarly provided also on the second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> including the data electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The above first substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are bonded together with a sealing material (not shown) with a predetermined gap provided therebetween, and filing the gap with the ferroelectric liquid crystal to form the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has four types of alignments to cause reflection to occur at each boundary therebetween into a scattering state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, voltage is applied to the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the data electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to create oblique electric fields <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that the molecules in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> move also in the directions of the electric fields so as to enhance scattering intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device having the above-described configuration, the relationship between the applied voltage to the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the brightness of display is the same as that of the liquid crystal display device explained in the fourteenth embodiment, and thus the driving waveforms in the standard mode and the power-saving mode which are explained in the fourteenth embodiment are appropriately selected for driving, so as to realize a liquid crystal display device of a scattering type and with a very low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although the example without providing a power generating means has been explained in this embodiment, a power generating means may be provided as in the liquid crystal display devices explained in the sixth embodiment and the seventh embodiment to perform driving by the energy supplied therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Modifications of Embodiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Although the explanation has been made mainly of the example of performing the whole display rewriting, in which all the scanning electrodes within the display region are sequentially selected to rewrite the display contents of all the pixel portions during periods in one field, in the explanation of each embodiment, it is also possible to perform the partial display rewriting in which only the scanning electrodes corresponding to a display change region where the display contents are updated within the display region are sequentially selected using respective driving signals and the data signals are applied only to the data electrodes corresponding to the region to thereby rewrite a part of the display region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> In this case, the number of scanning electrodes to be selected is small in the case of performing the partial display rewriting as compared to the case of performing the whole display rewriting, so that the period required for rewriting can be decreased even if the selection period for selecting one scanning electrode is increased. Therefore, it is effective that the selection period is made longer when performing the partial display rewriting than when performing the whole display rewriting, so as to perform write by a signal at a low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the whole display rewriting is performed again after the partial display rewriting is performed, it is preferable that a refresh period is provided before the performance of the whole display rewriting to apply the refresh voltage to the liquid crystal layer so as to cancel the unbalance of charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> Further, the selection period in each driving signal is not limited to the value explained in each embodiment, but it can be appropriately set in accordance with the display contents. In this case, as the selection period is set longer, the optical change in the liquid crystal layer can be induced by a signal with a smaller amplitude, resulting in a reduction in power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the driving signals in the standard mode and the power-saving mode are not limited to the combinations explained in the embodiments, but necessary signals can appropriately be combined for use. It is not always necessary to make the signals in both modes applicable, and it is naturally adoptable to select the driving signal from a signal group including signals in plural types of standard modes or in plural types of power-saving modes and to apply them. Furthermore, the liquid crystal layer charge memory period is appropriately provided in each driving signal including the driving signal in the standard mode, which makes it possible to perform display with reduced power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> The switching (selection) of the driving signal may be performed at a predetermined time. For example, it is preferable to set the selection period very long and slowly perform rewriting by a small voltage amplitude or to provide the liquid crystal layer charge memory period to hold the display during the time when it is considered that no users are looking at the display such as at night or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible to use a chiral nematic liquid crystal other than the ferroelectric liquid crystal for the liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal display device explained in each embodiment. Further, it is also adoptable to use a scattering type liquid crystal layer composed of the ferroelectric liquid crystal and a transparent solid substance containing the ferroelectric liquid crystal using no polarizer to perform display in a scattering state and a transmission state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> Further, the explanation has been made assuming that the center voltage of the driving signal is 0 V in the explanation of each embodiment, but a signal having the same waveform may be applied by a negative voltage with the maximum voltage being 0 V. If the selection signal and the data signal have the same center voltage, an appropriate voltage value may be set in consideration of simplification of the signal generation circuit and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> As has been described, according to a liquid crystal display device of this invention and a driving method of the same, a selection period for selecting a scanning electrode is set in accordance with display contents and the required frequency of update thereof to configure a liquid crystal display device with a remarkably low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> Especially when there is no need to update the display, the voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal layer is made zero or at least one of the scanning electrode and the data electrode is set at a floating potential, which makes it possible to hold the display with almost no power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a liquid crystal display device provided with a power generating element, by selecting the driving waveform for a power consumption in accordance with the amount of power generated by the power generating element and the amount of power stored in a secondary battery, it is possible to configure a self-standing liquid crystal display device which covers all the driving energy only by the generated energy by the power generating element installed in the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> Such a liquid crystal display device can be used widely for a portable electronic device such as a wristwatch, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile game machine, or the like, which is strongly required to decrease in size and cannot be provided with a large capacity battery. Further, it is very effective to use the liquid crystal display device for other electronic devices because of a substantial reduction in power consumption. </paragraph>
