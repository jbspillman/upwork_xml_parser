<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As is well known, it is not a special thing that people, young and old, for all times and spaces are interested in heath as far as a human being exists. Health is one of things that are always cared about in daily lives. Particularly, our daily lives are exposed to harmful environments in which environmental pollution is severe and there is generated a new disease that has never been seen. Interest in and desire for keeping health from the harmful environments are accordingly on the increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As a result of such interest and effort to keep health, substances, medicines, and foods that are helpful in curing diseases or improving health have been found or developed, and provided in a state of being easily taken and treated, such as a state in which a liquid medicine is contained in a packing-bottle, a state in which a granular medicine or a powdered medicine is contained in a capsule, or a state of tablet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In most cases of the health foods for improving health and medicines for curing diseases and relieving pains, different kinds of medicines are often recommended to be ingested together and it seems to be natural. By way of example, a medicine which is most conforming with healing of a target disease is basically used, and auxiliary medicines are also prescribed and taken for the purpose of raising a synergy effect, reducing an adverse reaction, or obtaining an additional therapeutic effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In particular, health foods called special nutritive foods, functional foods, etc., are believed to be highly beneficial to health. In general, when being ingested together various medicines, the health foods rarely cause an adverse reaction, rather, enhance virtue or produce other additional therapeutic effect. Therefore, the health foods get used to so-called mixed ingestion. For example, in some cases, a liquid medicine contained in a packing-bottle, a capsule, and a tablet are taken together, a capsule and a tablet are taken together, a liquid medicine, a capsule and a tablet are taken together, or one kind of capsule or other kind of capsule and other kind of capsule or other kind of tablet are taken together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Let&apos;s assume a case of health foods in which a liquid medicine and a capsule, or a liquid medicine and a tablet are taken together. Since the respective medicines are separately provided, everyone who wants to ingest or sell them should disadvantageously purchase or prepare each medicine. In particular, to select medicines edible together is almost impossible for general people and requires considerable carefulness even for a seller, a doctor and a pharmacist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, there are other medicines most suitable for specific medicines in the light of purposes, such as enhancement in virtue, production of additional effect, prevention of adverse reaction, and the likes. Similarly, when a food is developed by using some specific foods as objects, other foods are sometimes recommended to be taken together. However, to keep these recommendations causes more or less inconvenience, and also there are many foods having similar virtue and effect to the especially recommended foods. Accordingly, to prevent inconvenience in selecting the especially recommended foods, or, in case that the pertinent foods are not prepared or there are no foods stored, other foods than the recommended foods are often suggested. It is unnatural and may cause unexpected adverse effect as well as finally decreasing expected effect of the mixed ingestion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the liquid medicine additionally taken to the capsule and the tablet is used as a drink water to maximize effect of the mixed ingestion, enable a convenient ingestion, eliminate rejection feeling of the capsule and the tablet as well as enhancing the virtue. In addition to the problem caused due to the difficulty in selection, there is caused increase in cost since the respective medicines are separately distributed and treated, and thus distribution system and inventory management are complicated. Besides, if the capsule or the table suitable for the currently distributed liquid medicine is to be provided together with the liquid medicine, or the liquid medicine suitable for the currently distributed capsule or tablet is to be provided in a state of being added to the capsule or tablet in advance, a conventional packing-bottle, capsule packing means or tablet packing means doesn&apos;t consider a structure for the above supposition. Thus, we cannot help adopting a primitive method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described in detail in connection with preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. For reference, like reference characters designate corresponding parts throughout several views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Initially, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrate a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A basic structure of a packing-bottle includes a bottle body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for accommodating a liquid medicine, and a main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being put on a bottle finish <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the bottle body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Well-known bottle and cap are used as the packing-bottle and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first preferred embodiment, and especially the cap formed of plastic is illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the well-known bottle body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, an extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upwardly extends from an upper circumference of the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is coupled with the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to close and open the extension part. An accommodating part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is comprised of the inside space defined by the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to accommodate auxiliary capsules, tablets, granular medicines, and powered medicines. The illustrated drawings show a state that a capsule <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is contained in the accommodating part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Here, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed according to the present invention, and the well-known main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is omitted. The well-known main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a shape in which the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the upper part of the main cap are removed from the main cap of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the shape which can be seen in our daily lives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Here, the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by being connected with a connection part a which is flexibly formed on a side of the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Without being limited to this, the cover can be separated and mounted as a separate cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is forcedly and elastically attached/detached to/from the extension part so as to improve a sealing effect, and, preferably, not readily separated against a user&apos;s intention. When the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are separately provided, at least one of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of plastic. Preferably, the cover is formed of an elastic plastic material and the main cap is formed of a metallic material, so that the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is elastically contacted and coupled with an inner wall of the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the unique elasticity of the plastic material. Further preferably, the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are all injection molded with a plastic material, so that a manufacturing process can be simplified. Most preferably, the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are integrally formed of a plastic material and the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected on a side of the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by using the connection part a as shown in the drawings. If the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not integrally formed with the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> but separately provided, the connection part a is removed in the aforesaid construction, which is not especially shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In particular, when at least one of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed of plastic or all of them are formed of plastic, the plastic is a colorless transparent plastic or a colored transparent plastic, so as for the capsule, tablet, granular medicine, and powder medicine contained in the accommodating part to be seen from the outside. The colored transparent plastic is advantageous when the capsule <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the tablet, the granule and the powder are apt to be changed in quality by an external light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, for the purpose of deterring ready opening of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a groove b is formed on an inner wall of the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a projection c is formed on the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be elastically coupled with the groove b. Furthermore, a lip part d is formed on a side of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outside beyond the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to serve as a handle when the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is opened and closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention constructed as above, the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is coupled with the bottle finish <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in any well-known manner in a state that a predetermined liquid medicine is contained inside the bottle body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the packing-bottle. The accommodating part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is defined by the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that are added to the upper side of the main cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a relatively simple way. The capsule <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the tablet, the granular medicine or the powdered medicine which is conforming with the liquid medicine inside the bottle body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in virtue and effect is contained and provided in the accommodating part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the operation for containing the capsule <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the tablet, the granular medicine or the powdered medicine in the accommodating part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, when the lip part d projecting to one side of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is held and pulled up, the projection c of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is in the insertion state into the groove b of the extension part is elastically separated and the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is easily opened, whereby the predetermined capsule <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the tablet, the granular medicine or the powdered medicine can be contained in the opened accommodating part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, when the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is closed under pressure, since at least one of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed of the elastic plastic material, an external circumference of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is forcedly/elastically contacted to an inner surface of the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to close the cover, and at the same time the projection c of the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is elastically inserted into the groove b of the extension part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to easily close the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Then, the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is prevented from being arbitrarily opened by virtue of the coupling relationship between the projection c and the groove b. </paragraph>
