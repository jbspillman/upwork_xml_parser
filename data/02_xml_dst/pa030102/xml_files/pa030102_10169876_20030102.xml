<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A portable safety kit including a plurality of compartments for accommodating first-aid means, and comprising means for fastening the kit to a vehicle or similar. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a portable safety kit including first aid means such as fire extinguishers, blankets and containers for bandages, plasters, et cetera, and for quick-reference first-aid manuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention is particularly suitable for common vehicles such as cars, vans and trucks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention is also usable in watercrafts for local and offshore coastal navigation, in aircrafts for commercial and leisure use and in holiday homes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The state of the art in safety kits for vehicles is constituted by metallic cases for extinguishers, mostly used for trucks and racing vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Those cases are substantially formed by a circular supporting base for an extinguisher, by a bracket which protrudes vertically from the base along the container of the extinguisher, and by two quick-closing straps adapted to wrap around the extinguisher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Cases made of plastics are also known and are formed substantially like the above described ones, wherein the straps are replaced by wings that partially surround the container of the extinguisher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The motorists normally keep a plurality of first-aid means scattered in the vehicle because fire extinguishers, first-aid boxes and blankets are commercially available only separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Also, first-aid manuals allowing quick reference in case of accidents are not commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A fire extinguisher kept in the boot mixed up with other items is not immediately available when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Conventional cases presently used in cars only partially surround the fire extinguisher and therefore do not prevent its release if the vehicle overturns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> DE-U-9214211, U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,974, U.S. Pat. No. 4,437,568, U.S. Pat. No. 3,254,756, U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,220, DE-U29713246, DE-U-9415691 all disclose safety kits either portable or fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> None of the cited prior art documents disclose a portable kit that can also be effectively fastened to a vehicle and, in the fastened position, still allows to rapidly access the first aid means included therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The aim of the present invention is to solve the drawbacks noted in the prior art by providing a multipurpose portable safety kit that can also be effectively fastened to a vehicle and, in the fastened position, still allows to rapidly access the first aid means included therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide a compact portable safety kit that occupies a minimal amount of space for example in the boot, or trunk, of a motor vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a safety kit that allows the user to keep the first-aid means always tidy and perfectly efficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This aim and these and other objects which will become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by portable safety kit, comprising a plurality of compartments for accommodating first-aid means, characterized in that it comprises means for fastening the kit to a vehicle or similar.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the covering may be constituted by a tubular portion made of plastics and adapted to the bottom of the extinguisher <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The second compartment <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is arranged laterally and adjacent to the first compartment <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The second compartment is open upwards, so as to accommodate a blanket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the like, which is rolled up and inserted therein vertically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The third compartment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is arranged laterally and adjacent to the first and second compartments <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The third compartment is closed, in an upper region, by a cover <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is pivoted horizontally to the rear delimiting wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The third compartment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> accommodates a box <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for plasters, bandages, disinfectants, et cetera, and a quick-reference manual <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is associated with the box <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
