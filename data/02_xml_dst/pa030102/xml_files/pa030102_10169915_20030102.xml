<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optically rewritable optical disc and to an apparatus and method for reading addresses prewritten to the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> DVD-RAM, CD-RW, and MD are examples of user-recordable optical discs that have become available in the last few years. This type of recordable optical disc has grooves formed along a spiral or plural concentric tracks with a phase change material or magneto-optical material formed on the groove surface. Addresses for specifying a particular location on the disc are also pre-recorded to the tracks using rewritable marks. This type of address is described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (kokai) H8-315426. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Kokai H8-315426 describes providing discontinuities in the grooves and using these discontinuous parts for forming a pattern corresponding to the address signal. A pattern corresponding to the address signal is a binary signal that inverts at each discontinuity, an on/off signal used for generating an ATIP (Absolute Time Pregroove) signal. The discontinuities are therefore used simply as a signal indicating presence or absence. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (Technical Problem to be Solved) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More address values and a method for more efficiently assigning address values is needed in order to create an optical disc with an even higher recording density. In an optical disc according to the related art, however, the discontinuities are nothing more than a trigger signal for signal inversion and can carry only one piece of information (trigger data). Numerous marks are therefore required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the approximate location of a track can be detected with the ATIP signal, but the position where recording starts cannot be precisely determined. This means that when appending a new recording after recording once, or when overwriting data in the middle of a previous recording, new data may be recorded over previously recorded data that is still necessary. Crosstalk also occurs more easily when the track pitch is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a solution for these problems and provides an optical disc wherein discontinuities or modifications are formed in the grooves and two or more meanings are imparted to the discontinuities or modifications in order to provide address information more efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide an optical disc whereby the positioning precision of the recording start point can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A yet further object of the invention is to provide an optical disc enabling the track pitch to be reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A yet further object of the invention is to provide an apparatus and method of simple design for accurately reading address information from an optical disc having address information containing two or more meanings imparted to discontinuities or modifications formed in the grooves. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a plan view of an optical disc according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> describes the placement of sector blocks. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> are the optical disc substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is preformed when the disc is made, recording area <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> where data can be recorded, and sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which is the data recording unit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows a sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> containing a specific number (such as <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) of sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> A phase change film is formed on the optical disc substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Data is recorded to this phase change film by optically changing this phase change film between amorphous and crystalline phases, and signals are read using the difference in reflectivity between amorphous and crystal phase parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The relationship between sectors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is described in detail next with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In an optical disc according to this embodiment of the invention a track comprises a number of consecutive sector blocks <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As noted above, each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> contains <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sectors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Each sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> starts with a header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> followed by a recording area <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> where signals are recorded and reproduced. A sector is 2448 bytes long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> A synchronization mark S is recorded in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The start of a sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be detected by detecting this synchronization mark S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> A positive mark or negative mark is recorded in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the second sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. A value of 1 is below assumed to be assigned to positive marks and a value of 0 assigned to negative marks. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> negative mark 0 is recorded to the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the second sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It is thus possible to assign one bit of information to the header in the second and successive sectors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (referred to below as successive sectors). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> It is therefore possible to generate 31 bits of information using the synchronization mark S and the following positive marks (1) and negative marks (0) by accumulating these data bits from the headers of the 32 sectors in a sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Stated another way, 31 bits of information can be dispersed one bit at a time to the 31 sectors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in a sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and a synchronization mark is disposed at the beginning of each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> so that the start of each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be detected. An address having 0 and 1 bits thus dispersed is referred to herein as a &ldquo;dispersed address.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> These 31 bits include 19 bits of primary data and 12 bits of secondary data. The 19-bit primary data identifies the sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> position. This enables detecting the location of (2 to the 19th power&equals;) 524,288 sector blocks <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This means that if the address of the first sector block in the optical disc is 0 and the sector block address value increments 1 at each successive sector block, the value yielded by the 19-bit primary data is the absolute address of each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and each sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> stores 2048 bytes of data and each sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> thus stores 65,536&equals;(2048*32) bytes, then addresses enabling a maximum 34 gigabytes of data can be assigned using this 19-bit address data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The 12-bit secondary data is allocated to an error correction code enabling correction if any particular bit in the 19-bit primary data or 12-bit secondary data is dropped because of a disc defect, for example, or is erroneously detected during playback. This could be an error correction code for all 31 data bits. Furthermore, because the sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> address value increments one in each successive sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the higher bits can be predicted from a preceding sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the 12-bit secondary data could be an error correction code for the lower 8-bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> A dispersed address is described in further detail in Japanese Patent Application H11-343060. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, an optical disc <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> according to the present invention has multiple spiral or concentric (spiral in this embodiment) tracks divided into sectors. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> sector headers (containing the synchronization mark S, positive mark (1) or negative mark (0)) are aligned along virtual lines in the radial direction of the disc, but the headers do not align in any radial direction in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the tracks are grooves and the space between adjacent tracks, such as the space between groove n and groove n&plus;1, is a land. The lands have a mirror surface. The grooves are wave-shaped wobble grooves. The wobble wave has a frequency of 153 cycles per sector, for example. The wobble period thus corresponds to 16 bytes. If the data is recorded with 8-16 modulation and one clock period is T, the shortest mark is 3T and the longest mark is 14T, and one byte is 16T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the invention a positive mark (1) is formed by a discontinuity of width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the track direction in the first groove, a negative mark (0) is formed by a discontinuity of a width <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> in the track direction in a second groove, and a synchronization mark S is formed by a discontinuity of width Ws in the track direction in a third groove. These groove discontinuities have a mirror surface such as found in the lands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The synchronization marks S, positive marks, and negative marks do not need to be aligned in the radial direction of the optical disc. The sector length can therefore be the same at any position on the disc, and full CLV control can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Recording start positions can also be precisely determined because recording can start immediately following a groove discontinuity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks can be formed using the groove discontinuities as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Before the grooves are formed the optical disc has a mirror surface coated with a photoresist. The wobble grooves are formed by emitting a laser oscillating perpendicularly to the track while the disc rotates. When the laser is interrupted during groove formation a discontinuity resulting in a synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0) is formed in the groove with the length of the discontinuity determined by how long laser emission is interrupted. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the synchronization marks S, positive marks (1), and negative marks (0) are formed at the peaks or troughs of the wobble groove, that is, where the amplitude is greatest, in order to make the groove discontinuities easier to detect. A single beam laser can therefore be used to cut the grooves by thus forming the marks in groove discontinuities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The widths Ws, W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the groove discontinuities corresponding to synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), and negative mark (0), respectively, are determined as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Mark width is preferably greater than the longest mark in the recorded data (i.e., longer than 14T in the present example) so that recorded data signals that leak into the tracking error signal as noise are not mistakenly recognized as a dispersed address, that is, a signal from a synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the synchronization marks S, positive marks (1), and negative marks (0) are disposed where wobble signal amplitude is greatest. Mark width must therefore be less than 112 the wobble period and preferably {fraction (1/4)} or less of the wobble period in order to improve detection precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The width W of the groove discontinuity corresponding to any synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0) is therefore </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>14T&lt;W&lt;(wobble period/2)&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> and preferably </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>14T&lt;W&lt;(wobble period/4).&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> To satisfy these conditions (1) and (2) and enable the widths of the groove discontinuities denoting a synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0) to be easily identified, the width ratio of these marks is set to 4:2:1, for example. While the ratio of the groove discontinuities could be 4:4:4, groove discontinuities in the third groove corresponding to the marks that are most important to recognize, i.e., synchronization marks S, are preferably 4, discontinuities corresponding to the positive marks (1) are 2 (or 1), and discontinuities corresponding to the negative marks (0) are 1 (or 2). Yet more specifically, the widths of these groove discontinuities are as follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> third groove discontinuities (synchronization marks S)&equals;4 bytes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> first groove discontinuities (positive marks (1))&equals;2 bytes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> second groove discontinuities (negative marks (0))&equals;1 byte </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that in addition to expressing whether or not a groove discontinuity is present, these groove discontinuities also express three different meanings (that is, positive mark (1), negative mark (0), and synchronization mark S) depending upon the length of the groove discontinuity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a device for reading dispersed addresses such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a waveform diagram of output signals at important points in the address reader. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this address reader has an optical head <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, high pass filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, comparator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, discriminator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The optical head <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for emitting a laser beam, and photodetectors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>offset from each other across the track center. The subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> obtains the difference of the signals output from photodetectors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and outputs difference signal Sa (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The high pass filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> passes high frequency components and outputs groove discontinuity signal Sb (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The comparator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> compares the groove discontinuity signal Sb with a specific threshold value Sc supplied from threshold value controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and outputs a binary groove discontinuity signal Sd (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The discriminator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> then determines if the digitized groove discontinuity signal Sd corresponds to a first groove discontinuity (positive mark (1)), second groove discontinuity (negative mark (0)) or third groove discontinuity (synchronization mark S). The demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> accumulates the <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> positive marks (1) and negative marks (0) following each synchronization mark S to assemble the dispersed address values into a single continuous address value. The difference signal Sa output from the subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a push-pull signal, and can therefore be used as a tracking error signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the difference signal Sa describes a sinusoidal wave corresponding to the track wobble. The difference signal Sa drops to zero wherever a groove discontinuity exists, and the signal level therefore drops to zero for a pulse width determined by the width of the discontinuity. The low frequency wave component (the wobble sine wave) is removed from the groove discontinuity signal Sb output by comparator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which acts as a filter, and groove discontinuity signal Sb therefore contains only pulses from the groove discontinuities. These pulses are compared with a specific threshold value to generate the digital groove discontinuity signal Sd. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the discriminator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in detail. The pulse width detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of this discriminator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives the digital groove discontinuity signal Sd and detects the pulse width therefrom. If the detected pulse width of the groove discontinuity signal Sd is 14T or less, the signal is passed to ignore processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> If the detected pulse width of the groove discontinuity signal Sd is 14T or greater and 24T or less, the signal is passed to output-0 processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which thus recognizes a second groove discontinuity signal and outputs signal Se denoting a 0 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). This signal Se is reset by the next groove discontinuity signal Sd. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> If the detected pulse width of the groove discontinuity signal Sd is 24T or greater and 48T or less, the signal is passed to output-1 processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which thus recognizes a first groove discontinuity signal and outputs signal Sf denoting a 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). This signal Sf is reset by the next groove discontinuity signal Sd. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> If the detected pulse width of the groove discontinuity signal Sd is 48T or greater and 80T or less, the signal is passed to output-S processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which thus recognizes a third groove discontinuity signal and outputs signal S denoting the beginning of a sector block. This signal S is reset by the next groove discontinuity signal Sd. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> If the pulse width of the detected groove discontinuity signal Sd is 80T or greater, the signal is passed to ignore processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and ignored. It will be obvious that signal Se denoting a 0 corresponds to a negative mark (0), signal Sf denoting a 1 corresponds to a positive mark (1), and signal S corresponds to a synchronization mark S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Signal Se denoting a 0 output from output-0 processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, signal Sf denoting a 1 output from the output-1 processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and signal S from the output-S processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are output to the demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which recognizes the dispersed address as a single address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> It will thus be clear that in addition to detecting whether or not the groove is present, the discriminator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates signals with three different meanings (that is, signal Sf denoting 1, signal Se denoting 0, and signal S denoting a synchronization mark) based on the length of the groove discontinuity signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the configuration of demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in detail. An encoder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> converts signal Se to a 1-bit 0 signal and signal Sf to a 1-bit 1 signal. The encoder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> outputs to the shift register <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which converts the 1-bit 0 and 1 signals of the 31-bit serial dispersed address to a parallel address. The latch <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> latches the 31-bit address signal in the shift register <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at signal S. A parity coder <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> uses the low 12 bits of the 31 address bits for a parity check code. The error correction processor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> uses this parity check code for error correction of the high 19 address bits of the 31 address bits. The demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thus outputs a 19-bit address for each sector block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that depending on the type of optical disc the grooves may refer to trenches or to the lands between trenches. Note that data can later be written to the mirror surface header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The address reader described above features a simple configuration able to efficiently read dispersed addresses. It will also be noted that the synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks are read using a difference signal and can therefore be easily separated from data signals recorded to the grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, forming the synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks within the width of the maximum wobble amplitude prevents an increase in crosstalk between adjacent tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Full CLV control from inside to outside disc circumference can also be achieved because the sectors are formed without changing the sector length between the inside and outside circumference and it is not necessary to align sector block boundaries in the radial direction of the disc. When the boundaries between the sectors and sector blocks where headers are written are aligned in adjacent tracks concentrated in the radial direction of the disc as they are in a zone CLV disc as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the optical transmittance of the optical disc recording layer differs greatly between the header areas and non-header areas. Different transmittance values create no problem when the optical disc has only one recording layer. When the optical disc has two or more recording layers, however, local variations in recording layer transmittance produce crosstalk between top and bottom layers, and different transmittance values are therefore undesirable. An optical disc according to the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, however, enables full CLV control, does not require that the headers be substantially aligned in the radial direction of the disc; the headers can therefore be dispersed, and interlayer crosstalk can be reduced in a multilayer optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Disc capacity can also be increased using full CLV control compared with zone CLV because unused space can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The grooves, synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks can also be cut using a single beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, groove discontinuities are formed in the optical disc described above by interrupting the laser beam used to cut the grooves, but can alternatively be formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> by momentarily shifting the laser beam to form groove offset part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The offset time of the laser is adjusted to control the resulting discontinuities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the identification marks are disposed at the beginning of each sector in the present embodiment but shall not be limited thereto. The marks could, for example, be detected at the end of the sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> An optical disc according to the first embodiment described above has groove discontinuities of different lengths formed in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the beginning of each sector with each groove discontinuity meaning a synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0), thereby enabling sector block addresses to be encoded in less space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an optical disc according to the present invention is suitable as a high density optical disc that is readable and recordable using an approximately 400 nm wavelength laser from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The reasons for this are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> An optical disc according to the present invention is a recordable, readable optical disc having a crystal phase (unrecorded state) phase-change material formed on the disc surface in the grooves. This phase change material is, for example, a germanium-antimony compound or a silver-indium compound. Data is recorded by emitting a laser beam at a specific recording power level to this phase change material to change the crystal phase (unrecorded state) to amorphous phase (recorded state) marks. Reflectivity is different in the crystal phase and amorphous phase parts of the groove. Data can therefore be read by emitting a laser beam at a lower power level, and detecting differences in reflected light from the crystal phase and amorphous phase parts of the groove to reproduce the recorded data. If the laser beam is in the 830 nm or 650 nm waveband, reflections from the amorphous phase (recorded state) parts will be weaker than reflections from the crystal phase (unrecorded state) parts. Furthermore, reflections from the mirror areas are stronger than reflections from the crystal phase parts. Reflections from the mirror, crystal phase, and amorphous phase parts can thus be ranked as strong, medium, and weak, and the three parts can be easily identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> If a 400 nm laser is used, however, the order of reflectivity changes: reflection from amorphous phase (recorded state) parts is stronger than reflections from crystal phase (unrecorded state) parts. Reflections from the mirror, crystal phase, and amorphous phase parts are therefore ranked slightly strong, medium, strong, and identifying mirror parts from amorphous phase (recorded) parts becomes difficult. With an optical disc according to the present invention, however, the width of the mirror-surface groove discontinuities is distinctly different from the width of the recording marks, and the groove discontinuities can therefore be easily distinguished from the recording marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In an optical disc according to this second embodiment of the invention dispersed addresses are recorded using groove modifications, more specifically using a groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and a combination <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10 a</cross-reference> single groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> denotes a positive mark (1); a combination <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> containing a groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> appearing within a specified time of the groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> denotes a synchronization mark S; and a groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> not followed by a groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> within a specific time denotes a negative mark (0). The groove bottom offsets and groove top offsets are generically referred to herein as simply &ldquo;groove offsets.&rdquo; Any one of these parts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> can be used as a synchronization mark, positive mark, or negative mark, but combination <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is preferably used as the synchronization marks, which are detected less frequently. The same applies to the alternative versions of this embodiment described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> A groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is formed by creating a momentary offset toward the track center from a peak in the wobble groove. A groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is formed by creating a momentary offset toward the track center from the bottom of a trough in the wobble groove. A combination <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is formed by creating a groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in a peak and a groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in the adjacent trough of the wobble groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Note that the groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a combination <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are separated {fraction (1/2)} wobble period, but could be separated (n&plus;{fraction (1/2)}) (where n is a positive integer) wobble period. Note, further, that the groove bottom offset could be formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> instead of as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The groove top offsets could also be formed in the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an address reader for reading dispersed addresses encoded as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are waveform diagrams of the output signals at major points in the address reader. Like parts in the address reader shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the address reader in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> are identified by like reference numerals and further description thereof is omitted below. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> are optical head <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> outputting difference signal Sa (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), high pass filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for outputting groove discontinuity (offset) signal Sb (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>), comparators <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, discriminator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Comparator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> compares groove discontinuity (top offset) signal Sb with specific first threshold value &plus;Vth (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) to output digital groove top offset signal Si (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Comparator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> compares groove discontinuity (bottom offset) signal Sb with specific second threshold value &minus;Vth (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) to output digital groove bottom offset signal Sj (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Discriminator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> detects whether the digitized groove top/bottom offset signals Si and Sj correspond to a first groove offset (positive mark (1)), second groove offset (negative mark (0)), or third groove offset (synchronization mark S). Demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> compiles the dispersed address into a single continuous address value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Signal Sa (S) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is the difference signal for both groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in combination <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>; signal Sa(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) is the difference signal for groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> only; and signal Sa(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is the difference signal for groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> only. A negative pulse is produced when there is a downward offset at a peak of the wobble groove, and a positive pulse is generated when there is an upward offset in a trough of the wobble groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Waveforms for signals Sa(S), Sa(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), and Sa(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) after removing low frequency components are shown as signals Sb(S), Sb(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), and Sb(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Signals Si(S), Sj(S) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> show the digital pulse signals derived from the positive and negative pulses in signals Sb(S), Sb(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), and Sb(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Because signal Sb(S) contains both positive and negative pulses, a pulse is present in both signals Si(S) and Sj(S). Because signal Sb(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) contains only a negative pulse, however, a pulse is present in signal Sj(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) but not in Si(<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). Likewise, because signal Sb(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) only has a positive pulse, a pulse is present in Si(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) but not in Sj(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The discriminator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> operates as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> If either pulse signal Si or Sj is received and the other pulse signal (Si or Sj) is then also received within a specific period of time (within {fraction (1/2)} wobble period), synchronization mark S is detected and signal S indicating the synchronization mark S is therefore output. This synchronization signal S is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> If pulse signal Sj is not received within a specific time (within {fraction (1/2)} wobble period) after pulse signal Si is received, positive mark (1) is detected and a &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is output indicating the positive mark (1). This &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> If pulse signal Si is not received within a specific time (within {fraction (1/2)} wobble period) after pulse signal Sj is received, negative mark (0) is detected and a &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal is output indicating the negative mark (0). This &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Signals S, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> are signals as shown in the bottom two rows of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and are output from the three output lines of the discriminator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereafter operates in the same way as the demodulator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> In addition to indicating whether there is an offset, the groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> contain information indicating the direction of the offset. Separate signals Si and Sj can therefore be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can also be used to identify three different meanings (S, <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in {fraction (1/2)} wobble period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Crosstalk between adjacent tracks also does not occur because the synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks are within the width of a maximum amplitude part of the wobble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Full CLV control is also possible because the sectors are configured without changing the sector length from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the optical disc and it is not necessary to align the sector block borders in the radial direction of the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The grooves, synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks can also be cut using a single laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Yet further, because the synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks are formed offset from the track center, intermixing of data signals with the synchronization mark, positive mark, and negative mark detection signals is minimal even when data is recorded along the track center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to reliably detect groove offsets when the groove offsets are detected with a push-pull signal because the difference signal is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> (First Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> A first alternative version of the groove modifications in the second embodiment of the invention is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> While groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are used in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, these are changed to groove descending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and groove ascending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in this first alternative embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The groove descending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> vertically inverts the phase of the sinusoidal wobble wave from the groove peak to the groove trough, that is, an approximately {fraction (1/4)} phase segment of the wobble period from the groove peak. The groove ascending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> similarly vertically inverts the phase of the sinusoidal wobble wave from the groove trough to the groove peak, that is, an approximately {fraction (1/4)} phase segment of the wobble period from the groove trough. The groove descending-phase inversion and groove ascending-phase inversion parts are together referred to as the groove phase inversion parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> synchronization mark S is expressed by a combination <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of consecutive groove descending-phase inversion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and groove ascending-phase inversion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> parts. A negative mark (0) contains only groove descending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and a positive mark (1) contains only groove ascending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The ends of the {fraction (1/4)} wobble period segments can be discontinuities in the groove as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> or sudden displacements in the groove as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> These marks can be read with an address reader as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the difference signals for the groove phase inversions corresponding to the three marks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. These difference signals are output from the subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As will be known from difference signal Sa(S), a difference signal that drops abruptly to the right is obtained where the phase inverts and there is an abrupt top-to-bottom change in the groove, and a difference signal that rises abruptly to the right is obtained where the phase inverts and there is an abrupt bottom-to-top change in the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the difference signal after it passes the high pass filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A difference signal that drops abruptly to the right appears as a negative pulse, and a difference signal that rises abruptly to the right appears as a positive pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows signal Si as the digitized version of the positive pulse output by comparator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and signal Sj as the digitized version of the negative pulse output by comparator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Discriminator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> operates as follows in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> If either pulse signal Si or Sj is received and the other pulse signal (Si or Sj) is then also received within a first specific period of time (within the wobble period), synchronization mark S is detected and signal S indicating the synchronization mark S is therefore output. This synchronization signal S is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> If a second pulse signal Si is received within a second specific time (within {fraction (1/2)} wobble period) after a first pulse signal Si is received, positive mark (1) is detected and a &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is output indicating the positive mark (1). The further condition that pulse signal Sj is not detected between the first and second pulse signals Si can also be applied. This &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> If a second pulse signal Sj is received within a second specific time (within {fraction (1/2)} wobble period) after a first pulse signal Sj is received, negative mark (0) is detected and a &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is output indicating the negative mark (0). The further condition that pulse signal Si is not detected between the first and second pulse signals Sj can also be applied. This &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Subsequent signal processing is handled by the demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In addition to indicating whether there is a phase inversion, the groove descending-phase inversion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and groove ascending-phase inversion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> parts contain information indicating the inversion direction. Separate signals Si and Sj can therefore be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Groove descending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and groove ascending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can also be used to identify three different meanings (S, <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in one wobble period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Crosstalk between adjacent tracks also does not occur because the synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks are within the width of the maximum amplitude part of the wobble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Full CLV control is also possible because the sectors are configured without changing the sector length from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the optical disc and it is not necessary to align the sector block borders in the radial direction of the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The grooves, synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks can also be cut using a single laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the phase inverts where wobble amplitude is greatest, the locations of the synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0) can be detected with good precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the groove descending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and groove ascending-phase inversion part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> could also be detected by detecting the wobble phase. This results in a greater improvement in the S/N ratio than does detecting the phase inversion edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> (Second Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> A second alternative version of the groove modifications in the second embodiment of the invention is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> While groove bottom offset <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and groove top offset <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are used in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, these are changed in this second alternative version of the second embodiment to descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. There is an abrupt rectilinear drop from the peak to the trough of the sinusoidally wobbled groove in the descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. That is, the groove is formed at the peak level for {fraction (1/4)} wobble cycle from the groove peak, the level then drops abruptly to the trough level, and the groove is then formed at the trough level for the next approximately {fraction (1/4)} wobble cycle, connecting to the groove trough. In ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> there is an abrupt rectilinear rise from the trough to the peak of the sinusoidally wobbled groove. That is, the groove is formed at the trough level through the {fraction (1/4)} wobble cycle from the groove trough, the level then rises abruptly to the peak level, and the groove is then formed at the peak level in the next approximately {fraction (1/4)} wobble cycle, connecting to the groove peak. These rectilinear descending and ascending groove parts are referred to herein as the rectilinear groove parts. Furthermore, a wobble wave containing a rectilinear groove part, groove phase inversion, or groove offset part is referred to as a modified wobble wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> synchronization mark S is expressed by a combination <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, a negative mark (0) is recorded using only descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and a positive mark (1) is recorded using only ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows a descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> These marks can be read using an address reader as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows the difference signal for rectilinear groove parts corresponding to the three marks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. These difference signals are output by the subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. As will be known from difference signal Sa(S), a difference signal that drops abruptly to the right is obtained where there is a steeper change outwardly from top-to-bottom in the rectilinear groove part, and a difference signal that rises abruptly to the right is obtained where there is a steeper change inwardly from bottom-to-top in the rectilinear groove part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows the difference signal after it passes high pass filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A difference signal that drops abruptly to the right appears as a negative pulse, and a difference signal that rises abruptly to the right appears as a positive pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows signal Si as the digitized version of the positive pulse output by comparator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and signal Sj as the digitized version of the negative pulse output by comparator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Discriminator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> operates as follows in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> If either pulse signal Si or Sj is received and the other pulse signal (Si or Sj) is then also received within a first specified time (within the wobble period), synchronization mark S is detected and signal S indicating the synchronization mark S is therefore output. This synchronization signal S is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> If pulse signal Sj is not received within a specified time (within the wobble period) after pulse signal Si is received, positive mark (1) is detected and a &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is output indicating the positive mark (1). This &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> If pulse signal Si is not received within a specified time (within the wobble period) after pulse signal Sj is received, negative mark (0) is detected and a &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal is output indicating the negative mark (0). This &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal is held until the next mark is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> The demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereafter operates as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In addition to indicating whether there is a rectilinear part in the wobble groove, the descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> contain information indicating the direction. Separate signals Si and Sj can therefore be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can also be used to identify three different meanings (S, <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in a wobble period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Crosstalk between adjacent tracks also does not occur because the synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks are within the width of the maximum amplitude part of the wobble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Full CLV control is also possible because the sectors are configured without changing the sector length from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the optical disc and it is not necessary to align the sector block borders in the radial direction of the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The grooves, synchronization marks, positive marks, and negative marks can also be cut using a single laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the rectilinear part is formed across the peak amplitude part of the wobble, the position of the synchronization mark, positive mark, or negative mark can be highly precisely detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Yet further, because the zero cross point of the sinusoidal wobble wave and the zero cross point of the rectilinear part are the same, the clock signal will not be disrupted at a mark when the clock signal is extracted from the wobble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in this second embodiment the location of the groove modification differs in S, 0, and 1 marks, and the location where recording can start therefore also differs. An additional mark is needed in order to unify the positions from which recording can start. For example, a groove discontinuity <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be added as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. More specifically, the recording start positions can be unified by starting recording after detecting a groove discontinuity <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> (Third Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> A third alternative version of the groove modifications in the second embodiment of the invention is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> uses one modified wobble wave to record one mark. More specifically, one descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> denotes one negative mark (0), one ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> denotes one positive mark (1), and one rectilinear pair <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> (containing one descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and one ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>) denotes a synchronization mark S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> In the third alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, however, a succession of modified wobble waves are used. That is, a specific plural number of wobble wave cycles (such as 32 cycles) is included in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of one sector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> included in the sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. To record a synchronization mark, the rectilinear pair <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is repeated to occupy plural cycles (such as 32 cycles in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as shown in the top row in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. To record a negative mark (0), the descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is repeated plural times in plural wobble wave cycles (e.g., 32 cycles) in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as shown in the middle row in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. To record a positive mark (1), the ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is repeated plural times in plural wobble wave cycles (e.g., 32 cycles) in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as shown in the bottom row in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment the modified wobble wave is recorded not just in the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> but throughout all sectors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> containing a recording area <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. For example, if there are 153 wobble wave cycles in one sector, the modified wobble wave is recorded to all 153 cycles of the wobble wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a modified wobble wave containing the rectilinear pair <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is recorded for 153 continuous cycles throughout the first sector in the sector block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and each rectilinear pair <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is used to represent synchronization data S. If a negative value 0 is to be recorded to the remaining sectors following the first sector in the block, a modified wobble wave containing the descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is recorded for 153 continuous cycles throughout each sector. Likewise, if a positive value 1 is to be recorded to the remaining sectors, a modified wobble wave containing the ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is recorded for 153 continuous cycles throughout the sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent that it is not necessary to repeat the modified wobble wave throughout the sector, and it can be repeated a certain plural number of cycles at any part of the sector. Furthermore, the plural cycles in which the modified wobble wave is recorded can be non-contiguous, such as every other cycle. By thus inserting space between the cycles containing the modified wobble wave other information can also be recorded by measuring the gap between the cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> By thus recording data to the wobble waves using modified wobble waves as described above it is not necessary to use track space to record the synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0), and data can be extracted by observing the shape of the modified wobble waves of the track. It is therefore not necessary to insert the synchronization mark S, positive mark (1), or negative mark (0) to the header <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or other specific location, and they can be recorded at a desirably location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> A discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is also recorded in the first wobble wave as shown in the top row in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> in order to make detecting the start of the sector block easier and more reliable. This discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be disposed to the peak of the wobble wave as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> or in the trough (that is, at a peak amplitude part of the wave), or at the zero cross point of the descending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> or ascending rectilinear groove part <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (that is, at the minimum amplitude part of the wave). The discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed at the zero cross point because the discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> will then not produce unnecessary noise during wobble wave frequency detection. It will be further noted that this location of discontinuities also applies to the discontinuities described in the first embodiment above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is formed by interrupting the track groove and overwriting data to the discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is therefore difficult. This is because light reflection differs greatly depending on whether or not the groove is present and the discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> behaves like noise in the playback signal. In the present embodiment, therefore, the area containing such a discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (such as block <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>) is used as a VFO recording area. A VFO recording area is an area where a monotone VFO signal is recorded for generating the PLL used to playback the data recorded after the VFO recording area. Some variation in such external noise simply appears as local jitter in a VFO area, and will not directly produce an error. Furthermore, frequency separation of noise caused by the discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is also possible because the VFO signal is a monotone signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a reader for reading a modified wobble wave as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> The reader shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> comprises a rectilinear wave detector <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, discontinuity detector <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, and distribution detector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The rectilinear wave detector <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> uses the major parts of the address reader shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Waveforms of the signals at major points in the rectilinear wave detector <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows the difference signals for the three modified wobble waves shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. These difference signals are output by the subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. This subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operates as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows the difference signals after passing the high pass filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A difference signal that drops abruptly to the right appears as a negative pulse, and a difference signal that rises abruptly to the right appears as a positive pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> shows signal Si as the digital version of the positive pulse output by comparator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and signal Sj as the digital version of the negative pulse output by comparator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In a modified wobble wave containing repeated rectilinear pairs <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, a pulse appears in both signals Si and Sj. These pulses appear once per cycle in the modified wobble wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Operation when the modified wobble wave has 153 cycles per sector is described next. In the first sector (the sector containing the synchronization mark S) there are 153 pulses in signal Si and 153 pulses in signal Sj. If the following sector records 0 data (negative mark (0)) there are no pulses in signal Si and 153 pulses in signal Sj. If the following sector records 1 data (positive mark (1)) there are 153 pulses in signal Si and no pulses in signal Sj. Note that due to noise and other factors the actual number of pulses may vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> The discontinuity detector <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> uses the major parts of the address reader shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> pulse is output when a discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is detected. Note that the subtracter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed in discontinuity detector <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> can be changed to an adder. When a subtracter is used the discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can only be detected when it is near a wobble wave peak, but when an adder is used discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be detected near the peak and near the zero cross. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> The distribution detector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The distribution detector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> comprises pulse counters <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, comparators <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, sector synchronization counter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. Pulse counters <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> count the number of pulses in signals Si and Sj, respectively. Pulse counter <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> outputs the accumulated count to input b of comparators <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. If a&gt;b (where a is the count applied to input a, and b is the count applied to input b) and the difference is preferably sufficiently great (that is, a&gt;&gt;b), comparator <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> outputs high. If a&lt;b and the difference is preferably sufficiently great (that is, a&lt;&lt;b), comparator <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> outputs high. If a b and the difference is preferably sufficiently small, comparator <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> outputs high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> These high signals are applied to the latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. If a high signal is received from comparator <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> outputs a 1 indicating a positive mark (1). This 1 signal is held until data for the next sector is detected. If the latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> receives a high from comparator <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> outputs a 0 signal indicating a negative mark (0). This 0 signal is held until data for the next sector is detected. If a high from comparator <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is detected, latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> outputs an S signal indicating a synchronization mark S. This S signal is held until data for the next sector is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> The sector synchronization counter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> counts the number of cycles in the synchronization signal (the same number of cycles as the wobble wave, but the wobble wave contains noise and the number is not stable). The synchronization signal is generated by a PLL circuit from the detected wobble signal, for example. First, the count is reset to zero at the discontinuity detection pulse from the discontinuity detector <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. The number of pulses in the synchronization signal, that is, the synchronization pulses, is then counted. The wobble wave has 153 cycles per sector in the present embodiment as noted above. A reset signal is therefore output to the pulse counters <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> every time 153 pulses are counted, and the pulse counters <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are reset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> The distribution detector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> compares the number of pulses in signal Si in one sector with the number of pulses in signal Sj. If the number of signal Si pulses is sufficiently greater than the number of signal Sj pulses, comparator <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> outputs high. Conversely, if the number of signal Sj pulses is sufficiently greater than the number of signal Si pulses, comparator <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> outputs high. If the number of Si pulses and Sj pulses is almost equal, comparator <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> outputs high. The latch <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> latches a high signal from any of comparators <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> and appropriately outputs a 1 or 0 signal. The sector synchronization counter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is reset by an S signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Subsequent signal processing is handled by the demodulator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> The 1, 0, and S signals can be detected more accurately by thus repeating the modified wobble wave. Furthermore, adverse effects of the wobble wave on the synchronization signal that must be detected can be minimized if a modified wobble wave containing a rectilinear component as described above is included in the modified wobble wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows the major components of a fourth alternative embodiment. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> the length of the positive amplitude parts and negative amplitude parts of the wobble wave differ so that the duty ratio can be changed without changing the wobble frequency. More specifically, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> the length of the negative amplitude part <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the wobble wave is longer than the positive amplitude part, and the length of the positive amplitude part <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is longer than the negative amplitude part. The wobble is thus formed so that this part <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is longer in a negative mark (0) and part <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is longer in a positive mark (1) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. It is therefore not necessary to differentiate the playback signal when discriminating the negative and positive data marks and the effects of noise can be reduced because a clock timer, for example, can be used to measure the duty ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> (Fifth Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows the major components of a fifth alternative embodiment. While a discontinuity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is formed in the first wobble wave in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> mark <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> locally increasing the track groove width is formed in this embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> This mark <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is used to detect the beginning of a sector block and is referred to as a block mark. The configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> does not produce a discontinuity interrupting the groove, and information other than the VFO signal can therefore be recorded using block marks. As a result, overhead can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> (Sixth Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows the major components of a sixth alternative embodiment. The variation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> forms a block mark <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> creating a local increase in groove wobble amplitude. Similarly to the variation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, this embodiment does not cause a discontinuity in the groove, and information other than the VFO signal can therefore be recorded using block marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> (Seventh Alternative Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows the major components of a seventh alternative embodiment. In this variation a wobble is formed only to one edge of the track groove. The preceding embodiments and variations apply particularly to so-called groove-recording optical discs that record data to the track groove, but there are also so-called land and groove optical discs that record data to both grooves and lands (the space between grooves) along the track. This seventh alternative embodiment of the invention applies to such land and groove type optical discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> In the disc shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> either negative data (0) (indicated by area <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>) or positive data (1) (indicated by area <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>) is recorded along one edge of the groove. This enables both the groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and adjacent land <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to be addressed by the same address. Data is recorded to both the land <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This configuration enables the track pitch to be further reduced so that recording density can be further increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> As will be known from the preceding description, the present invention forms a wobble of a specific shape and cycle in a unit period of the track groove and records different shapes differing according to uniformly defined secondary information in said unit period. The present invention can therefore provide an optical disc medium that is suitable to high density recording, can record address information that reduces or eliminates overhead, and can generate a monotone wobble playback signal. </paragraph>
