<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an assembling method for industrial members using information regarding inherent properties of individual members and a processing method for the member itself. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the industrial field, the assembling of mating members has a wide variety of applications. A typical example thereof is mechanical parts requiring a fit such as a clearance fit or an interference fit. As an example of clearance fit, there can be cited many examples including upper and lower punches and a sleeve in a press molding die, which is an assembly in which the members can be moved relatively, a rolling element and inner and outer rings in a rolling bearing, a piston and a cylinder liner in an internal combustion engine, and a piston pin and a piston and a connecting rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, as an assembly in which members requiring a fit such as a transition fit or an interference fit cannot be moved relatively, there can be cited fixing of a boss to a rim in a gear, fitting of a bearing bush in a housing, and fastening of a ceramic rotor shaft portion to a metallic shaft in a ceramic gas turbine rotor. In the case where such members are connected, the relative dimensions in the connecting portion is important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The shape dimension of a member distributes with a variation. In fitting, in order to meet a proper fitting condition, the variations in shape dimension of member are decreased by machining, that is, a member is machined so as to have high accuracy. However, in some cases, sufficient machining accuracy cannot be secured, or machining cannot be performed. In such cases, conventionally, a method has been used in which the shape dimension of member is measured individually, and members are classified according to dimension range based on the measurement result to form some dimension range lots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> After the mating members are classified into some dimension range lots as described above, proper mating dimension range lots are selected, and members in each lot are used to make assembly. Sometimes, the dimension range lot classification is made for both members. Sometimes, the classification is made for only a member having relatively large variations because it cannot have sufficient machining accuracy or cannot be machined, and the shape dimension of the mating member is matched to a typical dimension of the dimension range lot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this method, however, since the influence of dimensional variations in a dimension range lot cannot be averted, it cannot be said that a sufficiently proper fitting condition can be realized. Therefore, a method has been thought in which based on the dimensional data inherent in individual member, processing is performed such that the mating members are machined individually so as to have a dimension that meets a proper fitting condition, or members having such a dimension are selected, by which a combination having a proper fitting condition is realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Conventionally as well, for example, a method has been used in which the dimensional data of individual members are entered on a measurement recording sheet, a number or any identification symbol is put on the members, and based on the dimensional data on the recording sheet, the mating members are subjected to the aforementioned processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in the method in which the dimensional data of individual members are entered on a measurement recording sheet minutely to control the members as described above, as the number of members increases, the work for entering data on the recording sheet becomes troublesome, and also the work for reading the data on the recording sheet becomes troublesome, which poses a problem in that not only enormously much time is required for the entering and reading work but also errors in entering and reading occur frequently </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The error in reading is thought to be basically caused by the fact that the member itself and the data are handled separately. Especially when a large quantity of members are moved to a place distant from the place where the members have been processed and are combined with the mating member, the member and information are transferred with a message not being delivered satisfactorily from worker to worker, which makes the problem more remarkable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and accordingly an object thereof is to provide a method in which an individual member and inherent information regarding the dimension etc. of the member can be handled integrally, when the mating members are combined with each other, members having a dimension that meets a proper combining condition are selected, and when the member is processed so as to correspond to the property thereof, proper processing corresponding to the inherent property of each member can be performed easily and surely without troublesome work. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Hereunder, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to examples, and the present invention is not limited to these examples. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As a specific example of the assembling method in accordance with the present invention, an assembling method for a sleeve and upper and lower punches in a press die is explained. A press die as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has been used widely in the industrial field. A function is required such that upper and lower punches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>slide smoothly in a sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> without leakage of a press material from the die under a pressing condition. Therefore, the inside diameter of the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the outside diameters of the upper and lower punches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are required to have close fitting accuracy for providing a clearance of several microns suitable for sliding and to have surface roughness suitable for sliding. As a material of press die, a stainless steel material, a cemented carbide material, or a ceramic material is used. Generally, the inside diameter of sleeve is machined by an internal cylindrical grinding machine, and on the other hand, the upper and lower punches are machined by an external cylindrical machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the case where the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is fixed to a rotatable chuck <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the inner peripheral surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is machined by an internal cylindrical grinding machine while the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a grindstone shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are rotated in the direction opposite to each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the machining condition becomes severe and a grindstone <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> wears heavily due to a small diameter of the grindstone <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and the grindstone is moved away by a machining force due to a low stiffness of the grindstone shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, so that it is very difficult to enhance the machining accuracy. In the case where the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed of a harder material such as cemented carbide or a ceramic material represented by silicon nitride and silicon carbide, the difficulty in machining the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with high accuracy increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case where the upper and lower punches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are fixed to the rotatable chuck <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the outer peripheral surface of the upper and lower punches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are machined by an external cylindrical grinding machine while the sleeve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the grindstone shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are rotated in the direction opposite to each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the diameter of the grindstone <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be increased, so that the grindstone wear is relatively low, and the stiffness of grindstone shaft is relatively high. Therefore, machining can be performed with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Also, it is difficult to measure the machined dimension with high accuracy at the time of machining due to the temperature condition of the workpiece and measurement environment. Therefore, the workpiece must once be carried into an inspection room having a favorable environment for measurement. In particular, the measurement of inside-diameter dimension of the sleeve is very difficult to make as compared with the measurement of outside-diameters of the upper and lower punches. For these reasons, it is very difficult to obtain a press die having a proper fitting combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> To overcome the above-described problems, the inside diameter of sleeve whose inner peripheral surface has been finish machined in advance was measured by a three-dimensional measuring instrument or a cylindrical gage in an inspection room, and the inside-diameter dimension information was marked with a bar code on the external surface of the sleeve. Next, in a machining room, the bar-code information marked on the external surface of sleeve was read, and the outside diameters of the upper and lower punches were machined based on the information. Thereby, a combination of the sleeve and the upper and lower punches having a proper clearance therebetween could be obtained, and additionally, since the outside diameters of the upper and lower punches were machined so as to match the inside diameter of the sleeve, allowance was provided for the allowable range of machined inside-diameter dimension of the sleeve, and thus the dimensional control in machining the inside diameter of sleeve was made easy to carry out. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As another specific example of the assembling method in accordance with the present invention, an assembling method for a ceramic gas turbine rotor is explained. Although the relation between the sleeve and the upper and lower punches in the press die shown in Example 1 is a clearance fit, the same is true in the case of an interference fit. FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show a ceramic gas turbine rotor. In these figures, a ceramic rotor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> subjected to high-temperature exhaust gas and a metallic shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are fastened by a shrinkage fit or a pressing method. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a shaft <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the ceramic rotor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is pressed into a hole provided in the metallic shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In this case as well, the hole inside diameter of the metallic shaft and the shaft outside diameter of the rotor are required to have high accuracy, so that the same assembling method as that for the press die in Example 1 is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the hole inside diameter of the metallic shaft whose inner peripheral surface has been finish machined in advance was measured in an inspection room, and the inside-diameter dimension information was marked with a bar code on the external surface of the metallic shaft. Next, in a machining room, the bar-code information marked on the external surface of metallic shaft was read, and the outside diameter of the shaft of ceramic rotor was machined based on the information. Thereby, a combination of the ceramic rotor and the metallic shaft having a proper clearance therebetween could be obtained, and additionally, since the outside diameter of the shaft of ceramic rotor was machined so as to match the inside diameter of the hole of metallic shaft, allowance was provided for the allowable range of machined inside-diameter dimension of the hole of metallic shaft, and thus the dimensional control in machining the inside diameter of the hole was made easy to carry out. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As still another specific example of the assembling method in accordance with the present invention, an assembling method for a rolling bearing is explained. In the relation between an inner ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, an outer ring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and a rolling element <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a rolling bearing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, since a groove <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the outer ring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is subjected to internal grinding, the same assembling method as that for the press die in Example 1 is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the inside diameter of the outer ring groove whose inner peripheral surface has been finish machined in advance was measured in an inspection room, and the inside-diameter dimension information was marked with a bar code on the external surface of the outer ring. Next, in a machining room, the bar-code information marked on the external surface of outer ring was read, and the rolling element and the inner ring were machined based on the information. Thereby, a combination of the outer ring, inner ring, and rolling element having a proper fitting dimension could be obtained. </paragraph>
