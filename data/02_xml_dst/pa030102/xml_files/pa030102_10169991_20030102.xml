<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an image sensor that detects radiation images used in medical and other fields, as well as to a scintillator panel that converts radiation images into visible light images that can be detected by an image sensor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> X-ray sensitive film has been used in X-ray imaging conventionally employed for medical and industrial purposes, but radiation imaging systems that use a radiation detecting element have become increasingly popular from the standpoint of convenience and durability of the imaging result. In this type of radiation imaging system, two-dimensional image data derived from radiation is obtained as electrical signals using a radiation detecting element having a plurality of pixels, these signals are processed by a processing apparatus and displayed on a monitor. A representative radiation detecting element has a construction in which scintillator is incorporated in light detectors arranged in a one-dimensional or two-dimensional pattern and incident radiation is converted into light such as visible light by this scintillator and detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> CsI, which is a typical scintillator material, is a moisture-absorbing material that absorbs atmospheric water vapor (moisture) and dissolves. Because the characteristics of the scintillator, particularly the resolution, deteriorate as a result, the scintillator must have a construction whereby they are protected from atmospheric moisture. As a construction whereby scintillator is protected from atmospheric moisture, the technologies disclosed in JP 05-196742A and in JP 05-242841A, as well as in International Publication Nos. WO-98/36290 and WO-98/36291 are known. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, in the technologies disclosed in JP 05-196742A and in JP 05-242841A, it is not easy to form the anti-moisture construction disclosed therein. The technologies disclosed in International Publication Nos. WO-98/36290 and WO-98/36291, on the other hand, solve these problems, but offer insufficient strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a radiation image sensor and a scintillator panel that have protective means that offer durability and strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve this object, the radiation image sensor according to the present invention is characterized in that it comprises of (1) an image sensor comprising a plurality of light receiving elements arranged one or two dimensionally, (2) scintillator having a columnar structure and formed on the light-receiving surface of this image sensor to convert radiation into light including wavelength bands that can be detected by this image sensor, (3) a protective film formed so as to cover these columnar structures of the scintillator and adhere thereto, (4) a frame that is disposed around the scintillator to set a separation distance from the scintillator and fix the protective film onto the image sensor, and (5) a radiation-transmittable plate fixed opposite to the image sensor by the frame to sandwich the protective film therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the contrast, the scintillator panel according to the present invention is characterized in that it comprises of (1) a substrate, (2) scintillator having a columnar structure and formed on this substrate to convert radiation into light including wavelength bands that pass through this substrate, (3) a protective film formed so as to cover these columnar structure of the scintillator and adhere thereto, (4) a frame that is disposed around the scintillator to set a separation distance from the scintillator and fix the protective film onto the substrate, and (5) a radiation-transmittable plate fixed opposite to the substrate by the frame to sandwich the protective film therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The radiation image sensor according to the present invention may comprise a combination of this scintillator panel and a detector that detects the optical image that passes through the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the scintillator panel and radiation image sensor according to the present invention, because a protective film is formed so as to cover the scintillator and adhere thereto, the scintillator is well protected from atmospheric moisture. Moreover, because the protective film is covered by the radiation-transmittable plate fixed above the protective film, strength is ensured. Furthermore, because the protective film and the radiation-transmittable plate are fixed by the frame, manufacturing is made easy and the overall strength is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that openings be formed in part of the area between the frame and the radiation-transmittable plate. By forming such openings, because the space between the radiation-transmittable plate and the edges of the scintillators is not closed, when thermal processing or the like is carried out during manufacturing, deformation of or damage to the radiation-transmittable plate, the substrate or the image sensor is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore preferred that the radiation-transmittable plate reflect the light emitted by the scintillator. This plate may comprise a metal plate, for example, or may be achieved by forming a reflective film such as a metal film on a radiation-transmittable substrate. Here, it is preferred that the radiation-transmittable substrate comprise a glass, resin or carbon-based substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the radiation-transmittable plate is made a light-reflecting plate, because the light emitted by the scintillator and redirected toward the radiation incident surface is returned toward the scintillator, the output light intensity of the visible image output by the scintillator is improved.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The best mode for carrying out the present invention will be explained in detail below with reference to the drawings. To facilitate the comprehension of the explanation, the same reference numerals denote the same parts, where possible, throughout the drawings, and a repeated explanation will be omitted. Furthermore, the dimensions and configurations shown in the drawings are not necessarily accurate or true to scale, and some parts may be enlarged in order to facilitate understanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a first embodiment of the radiation image sensor according to the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an expanded view of a part thereof, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a top view thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed from an insulating material such as glass and a light receiving unit wherein light receiving elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that carry out photoelectric conversion are arranged two-dimensionally on the substrate. These light receiving elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprise amorphous silicon diodes (PD) or thin film transistors (TFT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having columnar structure to convert incident radiation into light that has prescribed wavelength bands (including not only visible light, but also electromagnetic waves within a prescribed radiation spectrum such as ultraviolet light and infrared rays) are formed on the light receiving unit of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may comprise various different materials, but Tl-doped CsI that emits visible light with good photoemission efficiency is preferred. The top of each columnar structure of scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not flat, but is pointed upward, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed such that it covers each columnar structure of scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, resides in the spaces therebetween, and seals the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a fine pattern of protrusions and indentations is formed on the surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that this protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprise a material that is transparent to X-rays and blocks water vapor, such as polyparaxylylene resin (brand name &lsquo;Parylene&rsquo;, manufactured by Three Bond), and particularly polyparachlorxylylene (brand name &lsquo;Parylene C&rsquo;, also manufactured by Three Bond). A coating of Parylene film offers excellent characteristics as the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, such as extremely small moisture and gas permeability, a high level of water repellence and chemical resistance, and superior electrical insulation performance even in a thin film, as well as transparency to radiation and visible light rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Details regarding Parylene coating are provided in &lsquo;Three Bond Technical News&rsquo; (the Sep. 23, 1992 issue), and its characteristics will be described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A Parylene coating can be applied via the chemical vacuum deposition (CVD) method wherein the coating is applied in a vacuum to a supporting member in the same fashion as metal vacuum deposition. This process comprises a step of pyrolyzing a diparaxylylene monomer that comprises the raw material, and rapidly cooling the resulting substance in an organic solvent of toluene or benzene to obtain diparaxylylene referred to as dimer, a step of pyrolyzing this dimer and generating a stable radical paraxylylene gas, and a step of causing the generated gas to be adsorbed by and polymerize with a material to form a polyparaxylylene film having a molecular weight of approximately 500,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> There are two major differences between Parylene deposition and metal vacuum deposition. First, when Parylene is deposited, the pressure is approximately 10-20 Pa, which is higher than the approximately 0.1 Pa used during metal vacuum deposition, and secondly, the accommodation coefficient for Parylene deposition is two to four digits lower than the accommodation coefficient <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for metal vacuum deposition. As a result, during deposition, the entire deposition material is first covered by a monomolecular film, and the Parylene is deposited on top of that film. Therefore, a film having no pinholes can be formed with a uniform thickness starting at 0.2 &mgr;m, and a coating can be applied to corners and edge areas, as well as to gaps that have a width on the order of microns and cannot be covered by a liquid coating. Furthermore, because heat processing is not necessary during the coating operation, which can take place at a temperature close to room temperature, the process does not generate curing-induced mechanical stress or heat deformation, and offers superior coating stability. Furthermore, coating can be applied to most solid substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising a radiation-transmittable material <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> coated with a reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is placed on the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such that the surface of the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (i.e., the reflective surface) faces the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Here, the reflective surface runs essentially parallel to the light-receiving surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Because the surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has the fine protrusions and indentations described above, gaps <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed between the surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the surface of the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (i.e., of the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The radiation-transmittable material <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may comprise a glass, polyvinyl or other resin, or carbon-based substrate. The reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may comprise a metal film or a dielectric multi-layer film formed through deposition, and in the case of a metal film, it is preferred that such film comprise aluminum deposition film or other film having a high light reflectance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed to the surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is set separation distance from the side surfaces of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that it surrounds the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. The frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises three layers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>arranged in that order from the side nearest the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>such that the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fixed by its own edges. It is preferred that this frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprise KJR651 or KE4897 silicon resin manufactured by Shinetsu Chemical, TSE397 silicon resin manufactured by Toshiba Silicon, or DYMAX625T silicon resin manufactured by Sumitomo 3M. These materials are widely used in surface processing to provide mechanical or electrical protection for semiconductor elements, and offer tight adhesion to the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a resin having good adhesion to the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such as World Rock No. 801-Set 2 acrylic adhesive (70,000 cP type) manufactured by Kyoritsu Chemical Mfg. Co., Ltd. may be used. This resin adhesive has desirable characteristics: it cures in approximately 20 seconds upon the irradiation of 100 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>ultraviolet light, the effective coating is flexible and sufficiently strong, offers superior resistance to moisture, water, electrical corrosion and migration, and has good adhesion characteristics, particularly in regard to glass and plastic. Naturally, appropriate materials, resins and adhesives may be selected individually for each layer and combined: a metal frame or glass frame may be used for the material of the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>or the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be integrally formed with the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The third layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> serves the function of connecting the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. It is not necessary that the third layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>cover the entire periphery of the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For example, where electrode areas <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are located along two edges thereof that are in close proximity to the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is acceptable if no third layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed along one edge of the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at which no electrode area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed, and an opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that connects to the interior spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed at one or more locations along such edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The presence of the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> prevents damage to the thin protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and enables it to be reliably protected, and also ensures the strength of the radiation image sensor. As a result, the sensor is easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The making process of this embodiment will now be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4D</cross-reference>. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed on the light-receiving surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (the side on which the light receiving elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed) by growing columnar crystal of Tl-doped CsI to a thickness of 600 &mgr;m via the deposition method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, after the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are deposited undergoes annealing at 200-210&deg; C., UV-cured resin is applied in a frame configuration around the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the resin is cured through the irradiation of UV light to form the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An automatic X-Y coating apparatus such as the AutoShooter 3 made by Iwashita Engineering, for example, may be used during this frame formation. It is preferred that the surface of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> undergo roughness processing during this formation operation in order to improve adhesion to the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed on the top thereof. Such roughness processing may comprise the formation of lines or numerous small depressions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The CsI that forms the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is highly moisture-absorbent, and if exposed to the atmosphere as is, absorbs atmospheric water vapor and dissolves. Accordingly, in order to prevent this, Parylene is deposited to a thickness of 10 &mgr;m using the CVD method so as to cover the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Gaps are formed between the columnar crystal of CsI as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but the Parylene enters these narrow gaps. As a result, a protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while adhering thereto. Furthermore, as a result of this Parylene coating, a fine thin film coating having an essentially uniform thickness is obtained on the surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having protrusions and indentations. Moreover, because forming the Parylene coating via the CVD method requires less of a vacuum than metal deposition and can be performed at room temperature, processing is easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed as described above is then cut along the length of the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> using a cutter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. Because protrusions are formed by the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is easy to determine the cutting location, and because there is a margin equivalent to the thickness of the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the cutter is inserted, there is no danger of damaging the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> located below the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, making processing simpler and improving the manufacturing yield. The protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is formed outside the cutting area and on the side opposite the incident light surface is then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is then formed by applying acrylic resin to cover the edges of the protective layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the exposed first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and curing it via UV irradiation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. When this is done, the second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed to a height that is approximately 0.5 mm higher than the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> By sandwiching the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> between the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in this fashion, the adhesion of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> over the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is further improved, which is desirable. As a result, because the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is completely closed off by the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, moisture can be reliably prevented from coming into contact with the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a decrease in resolution of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> due to moisture-absorption based deterioration in the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next, a reflective plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising a radiation-transmittable material <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which is a 0.4 mm-thick glass plate, and a reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed on one surface thereof by vapor deposition of aluminum to a 1000 &angst; thickness, is placed on the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the reflective surface thereof, i.e., the surface on which the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed, faces the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. When this is done, it is preferred that the light-receiving surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface of the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> run essentially parallel to each other, and that the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> be located such that they are in contact or in close proximity to each other. A third layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed by applying UV-cured resin between the reflective plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and curing it through the irradiation of UV light, whereby the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed to the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>. When this is done, openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are formed by not applying UV-cured resin to a part of the edge of the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> located on a side of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at which electrode areas <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are not present. The radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of this embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is obtained in this fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Where heat processing must be performed with regard to the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> made as described above, or where this sensor is used in an environment subject to fluctuations in temperature, because air can freely enter and exit the spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, deformation in the constituent members of the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> such as the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to expansion or contraction of the air inside the interior spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment will now be explained. The X-rays (radiation) incident on the incident light surface, i.e., the top surface in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pass through the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (the radiation-transmittable material <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>), the spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and reach the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. These X-rays are absorbed by the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and visible light rays are emitted in proportion to the amount of X-rays. Part of the emitted visible light rays that are redirected toward the X-ray incidence direction are reflected at the boundary surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and return to the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The visible light released through the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and returns to the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, almost all of the visible light emitted by the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> enters the light receiving elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Consequently, efficient, high-sensitivity measurement can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Electrical signals corresponding to the amount of visible light are generated by each light receiving element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via photoelectric conversion and are accumulated at fixed intervals. Because the amount of visible light corresponds to the amount of incident X-ray radiation, the electrical signals accumulated in each light receiving element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> correspond to the amount of incident X-ray radiation, and an image signal corresponding to the X-ray image is obtained. The image signals accumulated in the light receiving elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are transmitted externally, and through processing of these image signals via a prescribed processing circuit, an X-ray image can be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the radiation image sensor according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A through SC. This radiation image sensor differs from the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that the end areas of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are fixed to the surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the edges are fixed by the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The making method therefor is identical to that for the first embodiment up to and including the deposition of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the performance of the annealing process. Subsequently, a 10 &mgr;m-thick coating of Parylene is applied via the CVD method such that it covers the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is thereby formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. The details regarding the formation of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are identical to those discussed in connection with the first embodiment, and will not be described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed as described above is then cut outside the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using a cutter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. The protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is formed outside the cutting areas and on the side opposite the incident light surface is then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> UV-cured resin is then applied in a frame configuration along the outer periphery of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the resin is cured through the irradiation of UV light to form the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An automatic X-Y coating apparatus such as the AutoShooter 3 made by Iwashita Engineering, for example, may be used during this frame formation. When this is done, the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed to a height that is approximately 0.5 mm higher than the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By pressing the edges of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> using the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in this fashion, the adhesion of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> over the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is further improved, which is desirable. As a result, because the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is completely closed off by the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, moisture can be reliably prevented from coming into contact with the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a decrease in resolution of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> due to moisture-absorption based deterioration in the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, a radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising a radiation-transmittable material <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which is a 0.4 mm-thick glass plate, and a reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed on one surface thereof by vapor deposition of aluminum to a 1000 &angst; thickness, is placed on the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the reflective surface thereof, i.e., the surface on which the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed, faces the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>. When this is done, the light-receiving surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface of the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> run essentially parallel to each other, and the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are in contact or in close proximity to each other. A second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed by applying UV-cured resin between the reflective plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and curing it through the irradiation of UV light, whereby the reflective plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed to the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Naturally, in this embodiment as well, the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not limited to resin, and the frame may be made of metal, glass, or the like. In this case, it is preferred that the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>be bonded to the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via adhesive or resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6D</cross-reference> are drawings to explain the making process for a third embodiment of the radiation image sensor according to the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The making method therefor is identical to that for the first embodiment up to and including the deposition of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the performance of the annealing process. The first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is then formed as it is in the first embodiment, but this time, the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed such that it is 0.5 mm higher than the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The protective film is then formed using parylene in the same manner as in the first embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed as described above is then cut along the length of the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> using a cutter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, and the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is formed outside the cutting areas and on the side opposite the incident light surface is then removed. The details regarding this process are identical to those discussed in connection with the first embodiment, and will not be described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, a radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising a radiation-transmittable material <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which is a 0.4 mm-thick glass plate, and a reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed on one surface thereof by vapor deposition of aluminum to a 1000 &angst; thickness, is placed on the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the reflective surface thereof, i.e., the surface on which the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed, faces the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. When this is done, the light-receiving surface of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface of the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> run essentially parallel to each other, and the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the reflective film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are in contact or in close proximity to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the resin frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is then formed by applying acrylic resin to cover the edges of the protective layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the exposed first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as well as such that it fills the gaps between and the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and curing it via UV irradiation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</cross-reference>. In this way, the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed to the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The radiation image sensor of this embodiment is obtained in this fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> By sandwiching the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> between the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the resin frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in this manner, the adhesion of the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> over the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is further improved, which is desirable. As a result, because the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is completely closed off by the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, moisture can be reliably prevented from coming into contact with the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a decrease in resolution of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> due to moisture-absorption based deterioration in the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is also acceptable if the first layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in this embodiment is formed beforehand as an integral part of the substrate of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or if it is formed by bonding a metal frame or a glass frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment of the radiation image sensor according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This radiation image sensor uses a metal plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprising a single member as the radiation-transmittable plate instead of the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. For this radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>any member that is either reflective or light-transmittable may be used. The radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be either a reflective member or light-transmittable member. As a reflective member, an aluminum sheet having a thickness of approximately 0.05 mm, for example, may be used. Where a metal plate is used, the apparatus may be made thinner. Where a light-transmittable member is used, on the other hand, it is easier to confirm the positions of the light receiving elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A fifth embodiment of the radiation image sensor according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. While in the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> was placed such that it was in contact with or in very close proximity to the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in this radiation image sensor, there is a substantial distance between the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A spacer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is used to place the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at a distance from the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This spacer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also plays a role to prevent the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from being peeled off from the outer periphery. Naturally, it is acceptable if the reflective plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is set a separated distance from the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by increasing the height of the resin frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, without using a spacer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>created by separating the radiation-transmittable plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the protective film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be made a layer of air or filled with a particular gas, or may be depressurized or made a vacuum. Naturally, openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be formed that connect the spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the outside, as described with reference to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It is acceptable if a moisture-absorbent material is disposed in the spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>outside the scintillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the light receiving elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the solid imaging element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. By placing a moisture-absorbent material inside the spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the humidity inside the spaces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be maintained at or below a prescribed level, and the moisture-prevention effect can be further increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a first embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention.
