<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a crawler belt suitable for use on crawler type vehicles, for example, on hydraulic excavators, hydraulic cranes and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, crawler belts which are used on crawler type vehicles such as hydraulic excavator and the like are largely constituted by rows of endlessly connected right and left track links each formed with an outer link portion and an inner link portion at longitudinally opposite ends, respectively, bushes located transversely between the right and left track links in such a way as to connect inner link portions of the respective track links with each other, connecting pins placed in the respective bushes and each having opposite ends thereof coupled with the outer link portions of the track links by fitting engagement therewith, and seal members provided on the outer peripheral side of the connecting pins between an outer link portion of a track link and a bush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art crawler belt of this sort is lapped around an idler wheel and a drive sprocket and rolled on in the forward or backward direction between and around the idler wheel and drive sprocket by a drive means such as hydraulic motor or the like to drive a vehicle body in a forward or reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent intrusion of soil or dust into gap spaces between bushes and connecting pins, it has been known in the art to provide an annular seal member of rubber or the like between an outer link portion of each track link and a bush (e.g., as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H7-285472). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the case of the prior art crawler belt seal as disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H7-285472, a gap space between an outer link portion of a track link and a bush is sealed up by a seal member, thereby preventing dirt or other foreign matter from getting between bush and connecting pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, once dirt gets into contacting surfaces of the seal member and bush, for example, it can accelerate abrasive wear of the contacting surfaces of these members to lower the seal effects of the seal member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Besides, in such a case, there also arises a problem that, through a seal member, dirt can get into a gap space between a bush and a connecting pin to accelerate abrasive wear to inner peripheral surfaces of the bush and/or to outer peripheral surfaces of the connecting pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, dirt which has intruded into a gap space between a bush and a connecting pin tends to accumulate in the gap without being discharged to the outside, to hinder smooth relative rotations of the bush and connecting pin as well as smooth movements of the crawler belt. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the above-discussed problems with the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a crawler belt which can prevent soil or other foreign matter from getting into gap spaces or clearances between bushes and connecting pins of the crawler belt from outside, preventing abrasive wear of and damages to sliding surfaces of bushes and connecting pins which would be caused by the intrusion of foreign matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a crawler belt which can prevent accumulation of soil or other foreign matter in gap spaces or clearances between bushes and connecting pins of the crawler belt to ensure smooth relative rotational movements of the bushes and connecting pins over a long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-discussed problems with the prior art, the present invention contemplates to provide a crawler belt of the sort which includes: endlessly connected right and left track links each formed with an outer link portion and an inner link portion at opposite longitudinal ends thereof; bushes transversely located between the right and left track links in such a way as to connect inner link portions of the respective track links with each other; connecting pins inserted in the bushes and having opposite end portions fitted in and connected to the outer link portions of the respective track links; and seal members fitted on the circumference of the connecting pins at positions between the outer link portions of the track links and the bushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The crawler belt according to the present invention is characterized by the provision of: a sliding bearing receptacle groove provided on and around an inner peripheral surface of each bush, and said sliding bearing receptacle groove having a diameter larger than said inner peripheral surface; a hardened surface layer provided at least on an inner peripheral surface of the bush or on an outer peripheral surface of the connecting pin to impart higher hardness thereto; and a resinous sliding bearing formed of a tubular synthetic resin material lower in hardness than the bush and fitted in the sliding bearing receptacle groove of the bush, the resinous sliding bearing having a slide surface on the inner peripheral side thereof in sliding contact with the connecting pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With the arrangements just described, by the resinous sliding bearing which is fitted in the sliding bearing receptacle groove on the inner peripheral surface of the bush, dirt or soil which gets between an outer link portion and a bush through the seal member during a vehicular driving operation of the machine can be trapped in an embedded state on the resinous sliding bearing which is lower in hardness than the bush, precluding a problem of soil accumulation on or between sliding surfaces of the bush and connecting pin. Besides, the hardened surface layer which is higher in hardness than intruding soil can prevent abrasive wear of the bush or connecting pin and enhance durability of these parts even if small fragments of soil get between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred form of the present invention, the sliding bearing receptacle groove is provided at least in right and left end portions on the inner periphery of the bush, and the resinous sliding bearing is fitted in each one of right and left sliding bearing receptacle grooves. With the arrangements just described, the resinous sliding bearing can be located in right and left end portions of the bush thereby to prevent soil from entering a gap space or clearance between the bush and the connecting pin from outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, according to another preferred form of the present invention, the resinous sliding bearing is provided with recessed grooves on the inner peripheral side thereof for trapping therein foreign matter coming in from outside. Therefore, soil which has intruded into a gap space between an outer link portion and a bush can be trapped in the recessed grooves on the inner periphery of the sliding bearing to prevent same from getting between the bush and connecting pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, according to still another preferred form of the present invention, a plural number of the recessed grooves are provided at intervals around the inner periphery of the resinous sliding bearing and extended in an axial direction. With the arrangement just described, the recessed grooves as axial grooves can be provided at uniformly spaced positions around the inner periphery of the resinous sliding bearing to efficiently trap soil or other foreign matter which gets into a gap space between the outer link portion and the bush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the recessed grooves on the resinous sliding bearing are filled with a lubricant oil. The lubricant oil in the recessed grooves on the resinous sliding bearing can be supplied, for example, to sliding surfaces between the bush and the connecting pin as well as to sliding surfaces between the resinous sliding bearing and the connecting pin for the purpose of reducing sliding resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present invention, an outer end face of the resinous sliding bearing is held in abutting engagement with the seal member, and the recessed grooves are each opened at one end on the side of the outer end of the resinous sliding bearing and closed at the other end. With the arrangements just described, intruding soil can be trapped into the recessed grooves through the respective open ends, and trapped soil is blocked at the other closed ends of the respective recessed grooves to prevent its intrusion into a gap space between the bush and connecting pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the seal member is composed of an outer lip portion fitted in an outer link portion of a track link, an inner lip portion slidably held in contact with end faces of the bush and the resinous sliding bearing, and a interconnecting bridge portion connected between the outer and inner lip portions substantially in the shape of letter &ldquo;M&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With the arrangements just described, when the seal member is fitted in position between an outer link portion of a track link and a bush, the outer lip portion can be resiliently abutted against the outer link portion, while the inner lip portion is resiliently abutted against end faces of the bush and resinous sliding bearing. Accordingly, a gap space between the outer link portion and bush can be sealed up by the seal member in good condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present invention, the seal member is composed of an annular outer seal member fitted in an outer link portion of a track link and held in abutting engagement with an end face of a bush, and an annular inner seal member accommodated within the outer seal member and held in abutting engagement with the outer seal member and the resinous sliding bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With the arrangements just described, during a vehicular driving operation, the outer seal member of the seal member, which is located on the side of the resinous sliding bearing, is held in abutting engagement with an end face of the bush, while the inner seal member is held in abutting engagement with the sliding bearing. In this state, a gap space between the outer link portion and bush and a gap space between the outer link portion and sliding bearing can be sealed up in a stable state by the inner and outer seal members, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, according to the present invention, the resinous sliding bearing is formed of at least a synthetic resin material selected from an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene-base resin, a polyether etherketone-base resin, a polyterafluoroethylene-base resin and a polyimide-base resin. With this arrangement, the sliding bearing which is formed of an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene-base resin, for example, can enjoy higher resistance to abrasive wear and better lubricative characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the hardened surface layer is formed of at least a compound selected from borides, nitrides and carbides. In this case, the hardened surface layer can be enhanced in hardness by using a boride compound layer therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the present invention, the hardened surface layer on the connecting pin is also likely to be formed of a tungsten carbide-base layer by thermal spray coating. In this case, the hardened surface layer can be enhanced in hardness similarly described above. </paragraph>

Each one of the bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed in a hollow cylindrical shape by the use of steel material, for example, such as carbon steel, alloyed tool steel or the like, and arranged to receive a connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the inner peripheral side thereof. In order to facilitate generation of a nitride or nitrides, the steel material for the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferred to be of the sort which contains at least one of chromium, molybdenum, titanium, zirconia, niobium and boron as its component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Opposite end portions of each metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are placed in the bush receiving bores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A of inner link portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the right and left track links by press-in fitting to connect between the inner link portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each one of the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided with end faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A at the opposite ends which are received and located in the seal fitting bores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of an outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in such a way as to oppose the inner end face <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C through a gap space. Further, the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are each provided with an inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B and, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter, a hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B to serve as a sliding surface to be engaged with the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In this instance, sliding bearing receptacle grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C of a diameter larger than the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed at the opposite ends of the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to receive resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which will be described after. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a hardened surface layer on the side of bush, that is, a hardened surface layer which is provided on the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed around the entire inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of steel material, and in the form of a layer of a compound which is harder than dirt or soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this case, the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by a nitriding treatment, a boriding treatment or a carburizing treatment of the bush surface to produce a nitride, a boride or a carbide thereon. In this instance, the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be arranged to contain one of niride, boride and carbide compounds or to contain two or more than two such compounds in combination. However, in consideration of resistance to abrasive wear of the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is desirable to adopt a nitriding treatment or a boriding treatment in forming the hardened surface layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connecting pins which transversely connect the right and left track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The connecting pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are each formed in a rod-like shape by the use of steel material such as carbon steel, alloyed tool steel or the like. Similarly to the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the connecting pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are preferably formed of steel material which contains at least chromium, molybdenum, titanium, zirconia, niobium or boron as a component for encouraging generation of a nitride. Further, through the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the outer peripheral surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is slidably fitted in the inner peripheral side of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which will be described hereinafter. Moreover, opposite ends of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are fitted in the pin receiving bores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A of outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the right and left rack links by press-in fitting to connect the outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> transversely to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Denoted at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a hardened surface layer on the side of connecting pin, that is, a hardened surface layer which is provided on the outer peripheral surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A of each connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Similarly to the above-described hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, this hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed of a compound which is higher in hardness than dirt or soil grains. Also in this case, as the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a nitride, a borate and/or a carbide is produced on the surface of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a nitriding, boriding or carburizing treatment. In forming the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, at least one compound can be selected from nitride, borate and carbide. Otherwise, a tungsten carbide (WC) type thermal spray coating film may be formed on and around the outer peripheral surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by the use of a flame spray coating method such as high speed gas flame spray coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are right and left resinous sliding bearings which are provided in transversely spaced positions on the inner periphery of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</cross-reference>, these resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed in a cylindrical shape by the use of a synthetic resin material which is lower than the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in hardness and at the same time has satisfactory properties in resistance to abrasive wear and slidability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed of one synthetic resin material or more than two synthetic resin materials selected from ultra high molecular weight polyethylene resin, polyether ether ketone resin, polytetrafluoroethylene resin and polyimid resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are each placed in a sliding bearing receptacle groove <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by press-in fitting, and the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A of each resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provides a sliding surface for the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Further, each resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has an outer end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B which is located at and substantially flush with an end face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A either at right or left open ends of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for abutting engagement with an annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Provided at the inner end of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, away from the outer end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B, is an inner end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C which is abutted against an inner end of the sliding bearing receptacle groove <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are a plural number of channel-like recessed grooves which are provided axially on the inner periphery of each resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at angularly spaced positions in the circumferential direction. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are in the form of channel of semi-circular shape in cross-section and extended in the transverse direction (in the axial direction) along the inner periphery of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as axial grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In this instance, one end of each recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is opened to the outer end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as an open end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A while the other end on the side of the inner end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is closed as a closed end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. These recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided to trap in soil or other foreign matter which might intrude into a gap space or interstice between the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Further, the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged to function also as an oil reservoir for pooling grease or a lubricant oil therein, maintaining a lubricated state between the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and between the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are right and left annular seal members which are provided on the outer periphery of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between an outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of each track link <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and an opposing end of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are each constituted by a seal ring of M-shape in cross-section, which is formed of a resilient material, for example, a resilient material such as urethane rubber, nitrile rubber or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this instance, each annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is constituted by an annular outer lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A which is fitted in the seal fitting bore <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an annular inner lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B which is slidably abutted against end faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and an interconnecting bridge portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>C of V-shape in cross-section which is bridged between the outer and inner lip portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B to interconnect same integrally with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further, the outer lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A of the annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fitted into the seal fitting bore <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as far as an inner end face <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C of the latter, and abutted against the inner end face <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C with a certain range of compressive resilience. On the other hand, the inner lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B on the side of bush is held in contact with the end faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with a predetermined range of compressive resilience. The annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> functions to block intrusion of soil or other foreign matter into a gap space or interstice between the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and at the same time to prevent leakage of grease from the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Denoted at <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are track shoes which are made of metal plates and provided on the right and left track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the respective tack shoes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are securely fixed to the outer side of the track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by means of a plural number of bolts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the like to connect the right and left track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> integrally to each other and to form treading surfaces for the crawler belt <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an upper structure which is rotatably mounted on the lower structure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and at <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a working mechanism which is provided on a front portion of the upper structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for lifting a working attachment up and down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In operation of the hydraulic excavator with the above-described arrangements according to the present embodiment, each crawler <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is rolled on in the forward or reverse direction between and around the idler wheels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and drive sprockets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> upon rotationally driving the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from a hydraulic motor or the like (not shown) to put the vehicle body in travel in the forward or reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> While the crawler belts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are being put in rolling movements in the manner as described above, gap spaces or clearances between the outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are sealed up by the respective annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> thereby to block soil or other foreign matter which might otherwise get between the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which are formed of a resilient synthetic resin material undergo deteriorations during use over a long period of time, particularly deteriorations in resilient force. In addition, in some cases, it becomes necessary to drive the hydraulic excavator itself by way of the crawler belts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for transferring same from a working site to a garage or other manageable place. In such a case, irregular loads can be exerted on the annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> between the track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to an unexpected degree to accelerate deteriorations of their seal capacity or strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With deteriorations in seal capacity or strength of the annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, it becomes more likely for soil or dirt to get between the outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> while the hydraulic excavator is running as a vehicle. Especially when the excavator is driven on a muddy surface, it is very likely that mud gets between the outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> However, according to the present embodiment, resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which are lower in hardness than the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided on and around the inner periphery of the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Therefore, should soil or mud get between the outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, part of intruding soil or mud is trapped in the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to block soil which would otherwise tend to intrude between the sliding surfaces of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Besides, according to the present embodiment, a plural number of recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided at angularly spaced positions around the inner periphery of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Each one of the recessed-grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is open at one end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and closed at the other end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B, and the open end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A is located face to face with an annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a major part of soil which comes in toward a gap space or clearance between the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be effectively trapped into the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through its respective open end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to prevent the soil from getting between the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In addition, abraded particles which may occur on sliding surfaces of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can also be trapped in the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present embodiment, the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a compound such as nitride, boride or carbide, which is higher in hardness than the soil, are provided on the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and on the outer peripheral surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, respectively. Therefore, should soil get between sliding surfaces of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, soil grains can be crushed between the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to prevent abrasive wear of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Besides, crushed soil can be removed from the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and stored in the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by letting same escape from the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through a clearance between the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the present embodiment, the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contributes to solve the problem of soil accumulation which would otherwise occur between the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, while maintaining the slide resistance between the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at a low level to ensure smooth turning movements of the crawler belts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> over an extended period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, since grease or a lubricant is filled in the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as described hereinbefore, sliding resistance between the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as well as sliding resistance between the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be maintained at a lowered level by lubrication to guarantee smooth and stable turning movements of the crawler belt <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> even in an initial stage of a vehicular driving operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case of the present embodiment of the invention, the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the side of bush and the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the side of connecting pin are formed of the same compound. Therefore, generally speaking, the two hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are considered to be more susceptible to cohesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> However, according to the present embodiment of the invention, the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of a different constituent in comparison with the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is provided on the inner periphery of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> separately from the hardened surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and held in sliding contact with the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and grease or a lubricant is supplied to a gap space or clearance between the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as described hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the provision of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with a grease supply contributes to prevent cohesion and scratching bruises which might otherwise occur to the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and to suppress abnormal metallic noises which would otherwise be produced by the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, cohesion of the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be prevented more effectively by employing different composition ratios for the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the provision of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the inner periphery of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> functions to absorb flexural deformations of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which take place when a load is exerted thereon from the side of the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during a vehicular traveling operation, thus suppressing deformations of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and as a result enhancing durability of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the provision of the hardened surface layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and on the outer peripheral surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> function to suppress flexural deformations of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to a minimum when a load is exerted on the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as mentioned hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, each one of the annular seal members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is constituted by the outer lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A on the side of track link, the inner lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B on the side of metal bush, and the interconnecting bridge portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>C which is arranged to interconnect the outer and inner lip portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B in the shape of letter &ldquo;M&rdquo;. Therefore, the interconnecting bridge portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>C is capable of resilient deformations between the outer lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A on the side of track link and the inner lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B on the side of metal bush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the outer lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A of the annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be resiliently abutted against the inner end face <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> while the inner lip portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B on the side of bush is resiliently abutted against the end face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, to seal up gap spaces or clearances between the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a reliable manner. The annular seal member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the above arrangements can block soil or other foreign matter which tends to get into a gap space between the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from outside and can prevent grease in the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from leaking to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is shown a second embodiment of the present invention, which has features in that a double layer seal is employed as a crawler belt seal, including an outer seal member which is fitted in a seal fitting bore of an outer link portion and an inner seal member which is fitted into a resinous bush from outer side, the outer and inner seal members being put in sliding movements relative to each other during vehicular driving operations of a machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the following description of the second embodiment, those component parts which are common or identical with counterparts in the foregoing first embodiment are designated by common or same reference numerals to avoid repetitions of same explanations. By the way, in the case of the following second embodiment, bush receiving bores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A&prime; which are provided in inner link portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are slightly smaller in diameter as compared with the bush receiving bores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A in the foregoing first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are metal bushes which are employed in this embodiment of the invention. Similarly to the metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment, each one of the metal bushes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes an end face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, an inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B and right and left sliding bearing receptacle grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>C (only one of which is shown in the drawing). Further, the metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is placed in a bush receiving groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A&prime; of an inner link portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by press-in fitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are resinous sliding bearings according to the present embodiment. The resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are placed in the sliding bearing receptacle grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>C of the metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Similarly to the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the foregoing first embodiment, each one of the resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, an end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B to be abutted against a double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and another end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C to be abutted against a root portion of the sliding bearing receptacle groove <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>C. Further, a plural number of recessed grooves <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (only one of which is shown in the drawing) are provided on the inner periphery of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each one of the recessed grooves <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided with the open end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A on the side of the end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B and the closed end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B on the side of the end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> However, the resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of this embodiment differs from the counterpart in the first embodiment in that its outer end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B is projected from the end face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A of the metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the transverse direction of the crawler belt, and fitted in the seal fitting bore <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Indicated at <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a right and left double layer seal as a seal member(only one of which is shown in the drawing) according to the present embodiment, which are interposed between the outer link portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of track links <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and metal bushes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Each one of the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is constituted by an outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which is fitted on a circumferential portion of the connecting pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> within the seal fitting bore <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of an outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and an inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is located within the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and fitted on a circumferential portion of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the proximity to the outer end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is an annular seal which is formed in an inverted U-shape in cross-section by the use of a synthetic resin material, for example, by the use of urethane rubber or the like. Further, the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is constituted by a first annular portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A which is abutted against an inner end face <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a tubular body portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B which is connected angularly to the first annular portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A substantially in L-shape and fitted in the seal-fitting bore <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a second annular portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C which is angularly connected to the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B substantially in L-shape and placed at the outer periphery side of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and slidably abutted against the end face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A of a metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and an inner seal receptacle groove <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>D which is defined by the above-mentioned first and second annular portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C and the inner periphery of the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is an annular seal which is formed substantially in a L-shape in cross-section by the use of a synthetic resin material, for example, by the use of polytetrafluoroethylene or the like, and accommodated in the inner seal receptacle groove <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>D on the inner peripheral side of the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Further, the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is constituted by a first annular portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A which is slidably abutted against the end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the first annular portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A of the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and a second annular portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B which is formed integrally with and radially outward of the first annular portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A and fitted on an outer peripheral portion of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in abutting engagement with the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B and the second annular portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C of the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> During a vehicular traveling operation, the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is provided on the side of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is slidable relative to the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the side of the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this state, the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is held in sliding engagement with the end face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A of the metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is held in sliding engagement with the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thereby sealing up a gap or interstice between the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a gap or an interstice between the outer link portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the case of the present embodiment with the arrangements as described above, it is possible to produce substantially the same effects as the foregoing first embodiment. Especially in the case of the present embodiment employing the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is composed of the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a contacting surface of the end face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A of the metal bush <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with the annular portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C of the outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as well as contacting surfaces of the first and second annular portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C and tubular body portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B with the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a contacting surface of the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with the end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B of the resinous sliding bearing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be used as seal surfaces. It follows that seal surfaces can be arranged over a longer distance in total and in the fashion of a labyrinth, that is to say, the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is improved in seal capacity and yet simple in construction can be formed simply the use of the outer and inner seal members <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the above-described second embodiment of the invention, the inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is constituted by one part. However, it is possible to employ a double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> as a modification. More particularly, in this case of the double layer seal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;, an inner seal member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; which is accommodated in an inner seal receptacle groove <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>D of an outer seal member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is constituted by two parts, i.e., a first annular portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A&prime; and a second annular portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case of the first embodiment, a couple of resinous sliding bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided in transversely spaced positions on the inner periphery of the metal bush <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to this particular arrangement. Namely, if desired, the resinous bush may be provided either in one position or in three transversely spaced positions on the inner periphery of the metal bush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the foregoing embodiment, by way of example the crawler type vehicle of the present invention has been described as a hydraulic excavator. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular example shown. For example, the present invention can be similarly applied to hydraulic cranes or other crawler type vehicles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As clear from the foregoing detailed description, the crawler belt according to the present invention is provided with a seal member to seal up a gap space between an outer link portion of a track link and a bush, a hardened surface layer formed at least on an inner peripheral surface of the bush or on an outer peripheral surface of a connecting pin to impart higher hardness thereto, a tubular resinous sliding bearing formed of a synthetic resin material lower in hardness than the bush and fitted in a sliding bearing receptacle groove on the inner peripheral surface of the bush. Accordingly, should soil or other foreign matter get between the outer link portion and the bush through the seal member, it can be trapped on an inner peripheral surface of the sliding bearing in an embedded state to prevent soil from accumulating and getting stuck between sliding surfaces of the bush and connecting pin. Thus, it becomes possible to maintain the sliding resistance between the bush and connecting pin at a low level and to turn around the crawler belt smoothly over a long period of time. In addition, even in case soil gets between the bush and connecting pin, the hardened surface layer or layers prevents abrasive wear of the bush or connecting pin to guarantee higher durability of the crawler belt. </paragraph>
