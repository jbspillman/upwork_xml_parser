<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to methods and apparatus for applying a secondary closure to an assembly of a lid attached to a battery box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For many years it has been known to manufacture sealed battery boxes by interposing a heated platen between the top edge of a battery box and the underneath of a lid to heat co-operating surfaces, removing the platen and pressing the lid onto the box. This apparatus has proved to be extremely satisfactory and there are a large number of such machines in existing manufacturing lines throughout the world. Such batteries usually had a plastic secondary cover or closure which could be clipped onto the lid and removed to allow topping up of the battery. More recent battery developments have enabled manufacturers to design a completely sealed unit in which the secondary closure has to be sealed onto the lid, once the battery has been suitably filled with electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has now been discovered that the majority of lid fixing machines, which exist in the manufacturing lines, are not particularly accurate and small deviations in lid position relative to the battery box occur. This is not only in the lateral and longitudinal positioning of the lid, but also in its orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is perfectly possible to overcome these problems with better engineering of the lid fixing equipment and the applicants have manufactured a machine which consistently assembles lids with the required accuracy. However, the investment in existing machines is such that this approach only provides a long term solution and currently battery manufacturers are rejecting a significant percentage of batteries because of mis-fitting secondary closures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> From one aspect the invention consists in apparatus for applying a secondary closure to an assembly of a lid attached to a battery box including at least one stop or the like for locating the assembly in a predetermined position, a holder for a secondary closure, a heatable platen interposable between and engageable with the closure and the lid to heat respective cooperable engageable surfaces thereof and a load applicator for engaging the heated surfaces to fix the closure to the lid characterised in that the locating stop or the like locates the lid in a predetermined position and in that the apparatus includes a platen support for allowing the platen to move to take up the orientation of the engageable surface of the lid and a holder support to allow the orientation of the closure to be determined by the orientation of the platen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To put it another way both the platen and the closure holder are &ldquo;floating&rdquo; so that their orientation is determined by the orientation of the lid. Thus any inaccuracies in the orientation of the lid are thereby automatically compensated. Further by locating the assembly by engaging the lid, the position of the lid can be placed accurately longitudinally and transversely relative to the platen. Previously the assembly had always been located by the position of the box </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> From a further aspect the invention consists in apparatus for applying a secondary closure to an assembly of a lid attached to a battery box including at least one stop or the like for locating the assembly in a predetermined position, the holder for the secondary closure, a heatable platen interposable between and engageable with the closure and the lid to heat respective co-operable engageable surfaces thereof and a load applicator for engaging the heated surfaces to fix the closure to the lid characterised in that the locating stop or the like locates the lid in a predetermined position and the apparatus further includes respective supports for each of the holder and platen for allowing rotation of the holder or platen about orthogonal axes in respective generally parallel planes which are further generally parallel to the predetermined position of the lid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In either of these arrangements the supports may be in the form of gimbals. The apparatus may further comprise guides for engaging the lid to guide it into a predetermined position and, in that case the stop or the like may be mounted on the guides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> From a still further aspect the invention consists in a method of applying a secondary closure to an assembly of a lid attached to a battery box, the lid defining a seat for the closure, the method including engaging a first face of a heated platen against the seat so that it takes the orientation of the seat, engaging the closure against the opposite face of the platen so that it takes the orientation of the platen, removing the platen and engaging the orientated closure against the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> From a still further aspect the invention consists of apparatus for locating a secondary closure on the lid of a battery box including at least one detector for detecting the position and/or orientation of the lid or a part thereof and a closure applicator responsive to the detector for adjusting the orientation and/or position of the closure prior to application, in accordance with the detected position/orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> From yet another aspect, the invention consists in apparatus for applying a secondary closure to an assembly of a lid attached to a battery box including at least one stop or the like for locating the assembly in a predetermined position, a holder for a secondary closure, a heatable platen interposible between and engageable with the secondary closure and the lid to heat respective co-operable engageable surfaces thereof and a load applicator to engaging the heated surfaces to fix the secondary closure to the lid, characterized in that the locating stop or the like comprises a seat for the battery box lid positionable between the heatable platen and the battery box and in that the apparatus also includes a battery box support for allowing the battery box to move so that the battery box lid takes up the orientation of an engageable surface of the battery box lid seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been defined above it is to be understood it includes any inventive combination of the features set out above or in the following description.</paragraph>

<brief-description-of-drawings>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention may be performed in various ways and specific embodiments will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: </paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> an assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a battery box <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defines a well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for receiving a secondary closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> the well provides filling access to the battery box <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 a</cross-reference> secondary closure applying apparatus is schematically and generally indicated at <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This comprises essentially three units: a lid and battery box assembly locating unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a heated platen unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a closure applicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises a support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> onto which the pre-formed lid and battery box assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is delivered by a conveyor (not shown) and a guide and stop assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The guide and stop assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes guides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which engage the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as it is moved onto the support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to locate laterally the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a predetermined, position. Mounted on one of the guides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is an end stop <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which also engages the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and locates the battery box longitudinally in its predetermined position. The support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is mounted on a ram <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which enables the battery box to be raised and lowered. The stop <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be swung out of the way on its pivot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when the closure applying process is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The platen unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprises a carriage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that can be moved laterally, as indicated by the arrows, by means of a gear wheel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is driven by a motor (not shown). Mounted on the carriage is a gimbal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> that supports a heatable platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The gimbal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> allows the platen to rotate about the horizontal axes defined by the pairs of stub axials <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The closure applicator includes a closure holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is mounted in a gimbal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on a head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is in turn carried by a ram <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that the head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be moved vertically as indicated by the arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The closure support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has orifices <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which are connected to a vacuum source (not shown) so that the closure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be releasably held thereon, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In use, the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is delivered onto the support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by the conveyor (not shown) and, as it moves onto the support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is engaged by guides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and subsequently by a stop <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held both laterally and longitudinally in a predetermined position. Thus as has been mentioned before, by engaging the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rather than the box <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, any longitudinal or lateral offset of the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with respect to the box <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is effectively taken out of the equation. Commonly the secondary lids will arrive loosely fitted on the main lid in which case they will need to be picked up initially by the head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> prior to the insertion of the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> above the box. Alternatively the secondary lids can be provide direct to the head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, from a cassette or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The carriage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is then driven by a gear <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that it is interposed between the well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A ram <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is then activated to press the well against the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and, because the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is mounted in the gimbal <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the platen takes up the orientation of the well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A ram <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is then activated bringing the closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> against the other face of the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can then take up the orientation of the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> because it in turn is effectively mounted on the gimbal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As soon as appropriate heating has taken place the lid and the box are retracted and the gear <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> withdraws the carriage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the orientated closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is pressed against the seats formed in the well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to seal it therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that rams <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> could be activated simultaneously, but because of the lower thermal capacity of the closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> there is some benefit in allowing the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to engage the well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> first. It may alternatively be desirable to provide a thermal break within the platen, although that could cause some difficulties with platen manufacture due to thermal stresses. It will be appreciated that the gimbal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> needs to be sufficiently stiff to maintain the position of the closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> once it has been orientated by the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, but alternatively means could be provided for releasably locking the gimbal once the platen has been engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, we see substantially the same apparatus as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, with a lid and battery box assembly locating unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a heated platen unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a closure applicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this case, the apparatus includes a battery box lid seat <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> associated with stop <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This seat is a fixed unit which positions the battery box lid when it is brought into engagement with the seat. The battery box sits on a battery support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The battery support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is allowed to float due to the use of springs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a spherical bearing <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. It is envisaged that other means of providing a floating support can be used, for example, using gimbal arrangements rather than springs and spherical bearings. What is important is that support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can more relative to the lid seat <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Again, by engaging the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, rather than box <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, any offset positioning of the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to the box <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is substantially removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When using the apparatus, the lid pick up arrangement <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> secures a secondary closure. The battery box support <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the lid seat by ram <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The springs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and bearing <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> allow the battery box lid to be positioned in the seat so that it will align with platen <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The closure applicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with platen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as the seat and lid are brought into contact and melting of the closure occurs which allows it to seal onto the assembly of a lid attached to the battery box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that as the platen and closure positions are determined on a box-by-box basis each closure should be accurately located, whatever the errors in orientation that have been created during the previous manufacturing step. It will also be appreciated, that the floating mounting of the platen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and closure <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could be substituted by a positively driven arrangement which orientated the platen and closure in response to the detected position of the well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or of the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such an arrangement is included within the invention, but in most circumstances it will be regarded as undesirably expensive. The detection could take place using probes to ascertain the location of the corners of the lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. These signals would allow computation of location signals which would be used to adjust the position and/or orientation of the platen and the lid holder. As the same degrees of freedom are required for both the driven and &lsquo;floating&rsquo; approaches the &lsquo;floating&rsquo; version is preferred except where there are difficulties in maintaining lid orientation. </paragraph>
