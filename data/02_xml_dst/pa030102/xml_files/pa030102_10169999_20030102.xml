<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A measuring device (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has a measuring housing (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in which a measuring head (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is movably supported, the measuring housing having at least one connection (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) for the supply of pressurized air for supporting by air the measuring head (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) in the measuring housing (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). The measuring head is designed to let out air and to generate an air cushion towards a measuring object (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). On the measuring head (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) there is provided at least one guide element (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) that is extending axially and protrudes into a chamber (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) in the measuring housing (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), the guide element gliding in and being supported by air in a channel (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) in a guide part (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), which forms an end wall to the chamber (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>).

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a measuring device according to the precharacterizing clause of Patent claim 1. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">STATE OF THE ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In many situations, for measuring material thicknesses for example, use is made of a type of measuring device in which a measuring head is supported movably in a measuring housing and the measuring head is held at a certain distance from a measurement object by means of air which is blown out between the measuring head and the measurement object and there forms an air cushion. By means of such an air cushion, the gap between the measuring head and the measurement object can be kept small and constant, which is advantageous for measuring accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is also important for the measuring accuracy, however, that the measuring head is easily movable in the measuring housing, which is usually mounted in a fixed manner. Supporting the measuring head by means of air makes it possible for the measuring head to move easily in the measuring housing, but, in order to achieve sufficiently good mobility and thus the possibility of good measuring accuracy, it is also necessary for electric wires between the measuring head and the measuring housing to be made very flexible so as to afford low movement resistance of the measuring head. This in turn results in these wires being very delicate and in relative rotation between the measuring head and the measuring housing having to be limited so as not to damage the wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Against this background, it has been proposed that the measuring housing be provided with axial grooves and the measuring head be provided with heels fitting these grooves in order in this way to limit relative rotation between the measuring head and the measuring housing. In this connection, however, problems of friction between the grooves and the guide heels arise in certain working positions of the measuring device, in spite of the measuring head being supported by air. Having a measuring head and a measuring housing of noncircular cross section has also been tried in order in this way to limit relative movement between them, but problems of friction have also arisen in this case and led to impaired measuring accuracy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to produce an improved measuring device which makes possible increased reliability and increased measuring accuracy. Another object is to achieve this by simple means. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is achieved by means of a measuring device having the features indicated in Patent claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> By providing the measuring head with axial guide means which run in axial channels in the measuring housing, it is possible, by means of air, to hold the guide means in an easy-running manner in the channels in changing working positions of the measuring device. In this way, good mobility of the measuring head in different situations is ensured. The embodiment selected also makes manufacture and assembly of the measuring device easier. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is mounted in a stand <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for measuring the thickness of a material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is supported by a surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for example in the form of a roller in a production plant for the material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and, arranged movably therein, a measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in which a transducer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is connected, via a wire arrangement <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to a contact device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is arranged in the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and via which the measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be connected to a measurement system for handling measurement signals from the transducer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which can work according to, for example, the reluctance principle, or in another manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is made from two housing parts, namely an upper housing part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which are joined together in a sealed manner and together delimit a chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to which pressurized air can be supplied via a connection <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is delimited at the bottom by a housing end wall, in this case a guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is mounted in a sealed manner in an axial bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and through which a tubular shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on a housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> runs, which housing forms part of the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and fits in the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Mounted at the top of the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is fixed by means of one or more locking screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Fastened at the top of the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are two rod-shaped guide elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, each running through its own channel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and each resting in its own recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this way, the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the two guide elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> together form the movable measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which can be displaced axially in the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It can be seen in greater detail from the lines I-I in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> how the sections through the components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, respectively, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows that the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided with a central hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the wall of this hole, there is an annular groove <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from which a number of radial channels <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> open in the outer surface of the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. By virtue of the fact that the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is intended to be mounted with its groove <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> directly in front of a number of holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> arranged in the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is possible to supply air from the chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the interior of the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via the channels <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This air passes, together with air which can flow into the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the top, down into the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and can, via at least one opening <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> at the bottom in the latter, flow out towards the material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to form a desired air cushion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided with a central hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. From this hole, a number of radial channels <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> lead out to a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> arranged in the outer surface of the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. On both sides of this groove <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, there are grooves for sealing means, and the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can in this way be arranged in a sealed manner in the lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with the groove <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> directly in front of a connection <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for supplying pressurized air. The shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> runs in the hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a certain play, and, in the same way, the guide elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> run with a certain play in their respective channels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this way, by means of air from the chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and air from the channels <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is supported in the hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by air, which means that the shaft can be displaced in a virtually friction-free manner in the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In a corresponding manner, by means of air from the chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the guide elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are supported in the channels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by air, which means that these can also be displaced in a virtually friction-free manner in the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. At the same time, by means of the guide elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is prevented from being rotated in the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with its shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with two threaded fastening holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> located essentially diametrically opposite one another, each for its own guide element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a slightly smaller diameter than the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as a result of which air which flows through the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can continue out into the open and at the same time form an air support for the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fixed in the lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of at least one screw <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is arranged in a sealed manner therein and extends into the groove <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the guide part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The air flow in the measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown by various, unnumbered arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the air entering via the connections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and then continuing so that it flows on the one hand through and on the other hand past the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The mass of the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adapted to the mass of the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with contents in such a manner that the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forms a sufficiently great counterweight which is capable of reducing the tendency to inclination between the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> when the measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted in different working positions. In this way, more effective support by means of air is made possible, with reduced friction and improved accuracy as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The upper part of the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be said to form a piston which is movable in the chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. By selecting a sufficiently great air pressure in the chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be made to tend to move out of the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> even when the measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted upside down in relation to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A suitable air flow through the opening <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> then produces a desired gap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> between the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The size of this gap can suitably be roughly 30-100 &mgr;m. In those cases where the material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is resting on a surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the form of a roller, that end of the housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> facing the material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> suitably has a curvature which corresponds to the curvature of the roller, as a result of which the air cushion can be stabilized further and the measuring accuracy can be improved. The measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> also advantageously has a certain mobility in the lateral direction relative to the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that a limited relative inclination is possible in order to allow the measuring head to position itself correctly relative to the material web <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the event of any relative displacement between the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The wire arrangement <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes an upper contact device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which is mounted in the upper housing part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and can be connected to a lower contact device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is mounted in the lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and, via a number of flexible wire elements <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, is connected to the wires of the transducer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which are located in the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this way, the upper housing part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can, if necessary, be removed from the lower housing part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without the relatively delicate wire elements <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The embodiment described above can of course be varied in a number of different ways, as required and desired, within the scope of the invention. For example, the number of guide elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and their positioning and embodiment can be different. It is also possible, for example, to reduce the extent to which the measuring head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> projects from the measuring housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in order to protect the measuring head better from lateral forces and in this way to produce a more robust embodiment. Likewise, for example, the number of air channels and their positioning can be selected in a manner different to that shown here. </paragraph>
