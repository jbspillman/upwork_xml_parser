<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method of transferring a substantially disc-shaped workpiece. The invention further relates to a device for carrying out this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A temporary gluing on so-termed workpiece carriers, in particular carrier discs or carrier plates, is a suitable procedure in the case of one-sided or two-sided surface treatments of substantially planar, in particular very thin and brittle workpieces while this treatment is being carried out so as to avoid a deformation of the workpieces or indeed fracture thereof. A very thin workpiece in the present context should be understood to be a workpiece whose thickness is small in relation to its length, width, or diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The German patent document 198 50 873 laid open to public inspection discloses a method of processing a substantially disc-shaped semiconductor technology product which comprises a plurality of electronic circuit bodies along at least a first main surface as well as a second main surface situated opposite the first main surface. In this method of carrying out treatment processes on one of the main surfaces of the product, a layer-type adhesive material is planarly provided on the opposite main surface of the product, onto which material a dimensionally at least substantially stable carrier element is provided so as to form a planar connection to said opposite main surface of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention has for its object to provide a method by which a simple and inexpensive transfer of a workpiece of the kind mentioned above from a first workpiece carrier onto a second workpiece carrier is rendered possible. The invention further has for its object to provide a device for carrying out such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of a method of transferring a substantially disc-shaped workpiece from a first workpiece carrier, on which the workpiece is adhesively connected along a first of its main surfaces by means of a first adhesive in an at least substantially planar manner, onto a second workpiece carrier, which method according to the invention comprises the following process steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> fastening the second workpiece carrier with at least substantially planar adhesion to a second of the main surfaces of the workpiece opposed to the first main surface by means of a second adhesive whose adhesive force is substantially greater than the adhesive force of the first adhesive, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> fastening the first workpiece carrier to a first retaining device, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> fastening the second workpiece carrier to a second retaining device, separating the workpiece from the first workpiece carrier along the first adhesive through the application of a pulling force between the first and the second retaining device, which force is at least partly perpendicular to the main surfaces of the workpiece, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> separating the first workpiece carrier from the first retaining device, and separating the second workpiece carrier complete with the workpiece connected thereto from the second retaining device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The workpiece is accordingly present on the first workpiece carrier, to which it was fastened by its first main surface by means of the first adhesive, at the start of the process steps according to the invention. The workpiece is transferred from this first workpiece carrier onto a second workpiece carrier by means of the method according to the invention, on which second carrier it is arranged with at least substantially planar adhesion along its second main surface. The connection between the second main surface of the workpiece and the second workpiece carrier is achieved here by the second adhesive whose adhesive force is substantially greater than the adhesive force of the first adhesive, so that the first adhesive is reliably separated when the pulling force is applied between the retaining devices, whereas the second adhesive keeps the workpiece fixed to the second workpiece carrier. The retaining devices here serve to transmit the pulling force to the workpiece carriers and are separated from the workpiece carriers again after the transfer of the workpiece has been completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention renders it possible in an inexpensive and simple manner to transfer mechanically vulnerable workpieces safely from one workpiece carrier to another. A separate treatment of the first adhesive for changing the adhesive force before the transfer of the workpiece is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In particular, at least substantially rigidly constructed workpiece carriers can be used here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The fastening of the workpiece carriers to the retaining devices may be achieved by means of adhesives or by magnetic forces, as desired. Said adhesives or magnetic forces will generate adhesve forces between the workpiece carriers and the retaining devices which are substantially greater than the adhesive force of the first adhesive, so that the workpiece carriers remain securely connected to the retaining devices when the pulling force is exerted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The separation of the workpiece carriers from the retaining devices after the transfer of the workpiece is preferably achieved by means of an ejection device forming part of at least one of the retaining devices. This ejection device advantageously operates at least one ejector pin or a pressure gas device when carrying out the separation step so as to exert a pressure on the workpiece to be separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In an alternative advantageous embodiment of the method according to the invention, the workpiece carrier is arranged on a support element in at least one of the retaining devices in which the fastening of the workpiece carrier is achieved by means of said magnet device, which support element is movable with respect to a magnet device and is of a substantially planar construction. The support element is moved together with the workpiece carrier from the operational reach of the magnet device for separating the workpiece carrier from the retaining device. This removal may preferably be achieved in that at least one of the workpiece carriers is arranged on a first support element, preferably of planar steel sheet on rollers, and the workpiece carrier is transferred to a second planar sheet support element through rolling of the first planar sheet support element for the purpose of separation from the retaining device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further embodiments and details of the method according to the invention are defined in the dependent claims following claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To carry out the method according to the invention, furthermore, a device is provided for transferring a substantially disc-shaped workpiece from a first workpiece carrier, on which the workpiece is adhesively connected in an at least substantially planar manner along a first of its main surfaces by means of a first adhesive, onto a second workpiece carrier on which the workpiece is to be provided and fastened with at least substantially planar adhesion by a second of its main surfaces opposed to the first main surface of the workpiece by means of a second adhesive whose adhesive force is substantially greater than the adhesive force of the first adhesive. In addition to the workpiece carriers for fastening the workpiece, the device according to the invention also comprises a first retaining device for fastening the first workpiece carrier to this first retaining device and a second retaining device for fastening the second workpiece carrier to this second retaining device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A device according to the invention is preferably used for handling a workpiece which is a semiconductor technology product, preferably a semiconductor wafer, and which furthermore is constructed along at least its second main surface for forming a plurality of electronic circuit bodies which are to be mechanically separated substantially perpendicularly to the second main surface. The invention in that case renders it possible to present the workpiece on the second workpiece carrier for a subsequent treatment of its first main surface in a simple manner by means of the transfer that can be carried out thereby, for example for a process step for thinning, coating, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further embodiments and details of the device according to the invention can be found in the dependent claims following the independent claim 13. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The device according to the invention is of a simple construction and renders possible a reliable, inexpensive, and thus rational manufacture.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the diagrammatic picture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> substantially disc-shaped workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in particular a thin semiconductor wafer, is fastened by its first main surface, which forms the upper surface in the position of the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown, to a first, at least substantially rigidly constructed workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of a first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a planar manner. The first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is preferably formed by a first adhesive constructed as a first, double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This first double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists in a known manner of a foil-shaped synthetic resin body whose two surfaces are coated with adhesive layers. A first of these surfaces faces the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a first adhesive layer and a second of these surfaces faces the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a second adhesive layer. This arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The picture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows the next process step. Here the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are fastened onto a second, at least substantially rigidly constructed workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in an at least substantially planar adhesive manner by a second main surface of the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, opposed to the first main surface and forming the lower side in the position of the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown here, by means of a second adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The adhesive force of the second adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is substantially greater than the adhesive force of the first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The second adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is preferably also formed by an adhesive layer constructed with a double-sided adhesive foil; this adhesive denoted the second adhesive below is formed by a second double-sided adhesive foil. The second double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> again consists in a known manner of a foil-shaped synthetic resin body whose two surfaces are covered with adhesive layers. A first of these surfaces faces the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a third adhesive layer, and a second of these surfaces faces the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a fourth adhesive layer. This arrangement is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fastened to a first of these retaining devices referenced <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fastened to a second of these retaining devices referenced <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The fastening of the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in this first embodiment is achieved by means of a third adhesive <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the fastening between the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is achieved by means of a fourth adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The adhesive forces of the third adhesive <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and of the fourth adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> between the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are substantially greater than the adhesive force of the first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and also greater than the adhesive force of the second adhesive <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

The action of the pulling forces applied to the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the effect of which is indicated by the dark hatching of the arrows <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, pulls the configuration of the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> apart. During this, the first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes detached, i.e. in particular, when constructed as a double-sided adhesive foil, the second adhesive layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereof forming the weakest link between said elements of the arrangement. The state of the arrangement after this separation step is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows the implementation of the separation of the workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as the next process step for the embodiment of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>. Identical elements have again been given the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the first process step clarified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is separated from the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the operation of the plunger <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the first ejection device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This is symbolized by the dark hatching of the arrow <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> moves the ejector pins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> against the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thus detaching the third adhesive <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. If the latter was constructed as a double-sided adhesive foil in the manner described, adhering to the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it is in particular the fifth adhesive layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the first surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of this foil that will become detached in this separation step. The foil thus remains on the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and may be used for a subsequent connection of the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to a (further) first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (for a further workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). To achieve a friction-free performance of this process step, the third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has holes in the locations of the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in accordance with the diameter thereof or with the diameter of the ejector pins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thus formed with the third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is diagrammatically depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which will be referred to in more detail further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> further comprises a support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for receiving the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after it has become detached from the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is laid on this support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for future use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In a manner similar to that of the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is also separated from the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This is shown in the lower part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. For this purpose, the second ejection device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is used in the same manner with the ejector pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> passed through the bores <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> through operation of the plunger <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>; the operation is symbolized by the dark hatching of the arrow for the plunger <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The fourth adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is detached thereby; if the fourth adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is constructed as a double-sided adhesive foil, its seventh adhesive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> present on the first surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the fourth double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will preferably be separated, so that again the double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> remains on the surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. A support (not shown) corresponding to the support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be used for taking up the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> separated from the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of the invention, being a modification of the above arrangement and the method carried out thereby. The ejection devices of the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> now each comprise, instead of the plungers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the ejector pins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a pressure gas device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by means of which the workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are separated from said respective retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through a pressure exerted on the surfaces <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the first and second workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> facing the surfaces <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the respective retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, elements of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> already described have again been given the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The first of the two pressure gas devices referenced <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a first pressure gas connection <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> through which a gas under pressure, in the simplest case constituted by compressed air, but alternatively of some other composition if this should be desirable for handling the workpieces (protective gas), is conducted into a hollow space denoted the pressure chamber, which is formed in the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This pressure chamber connects the first pressure gas connection <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which now serve as gas outlets. An arrow <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> indicates the introduction of gas under pressure and thus the force exerted on the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner, the second of the two pressure gas devices referenced <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> comprises a second pressure gas connection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> through which the gas under pressure is conducted into a further pressure chamber which is formed in the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in a corresponding manner. This further pressure chamber connects the second pressure gas connection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the bores <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which now serve as gas outlets. An arrow <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> indicates the introduction of the gas under pressure and thus the force exerted on the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> after the next process step, with the elements described above again having the same reference numerals. The pulling forces exerted on the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whose effect is indicated with the dark hatching of the arrows <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, as in the first embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pull the configuration of the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> apart. The first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is detached again thereby, and if constructed as a double-sided adhesive foil, the second adhesive layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is detached in particular as being the weakest link between the said elements of the arrangement. The state of the arrangement after this separation step is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows the separation of the workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the retaining devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is carried out as the next process step in the embodiment of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. Elements described above have again been given the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the first process step illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> for this embodiment, the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is separated from the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through operation of the first pressure gas device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. This is indicated with the dark hatching of the arrow <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The pressure of the pressure gas acts on the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, thus detaching the third adhesive <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. If the latter is again formed as a double-sided adhesive foil in the manner described above, adhering to the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it is in particular the fifth adhesive layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the first surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of this foil which is detached in this separation step. The foil thus remains on the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and may be used for a subsequent connection of the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to a (further) first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (for a further workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has holes in the regions of the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with corresponding diameters so as to achieve a friction-free performance of this process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thus formed of the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a shape as diagrammatically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which will be discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> also comprises a support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for receiving the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> after its separation from the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is laid on this support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for further use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this second embodiment, again, the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is separated from the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the same manner as the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This is shown in the lower part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The second pressure gas device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is used for this purpose in an analogous manner; its operation is indicated by the dark hatching of the arrow <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The fourth adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is separated thereby; if the fourth adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is constructed as a double-sided adhesive foil, its seventh adhesive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> present on the first surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the fourth double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is preferably separated again, so that the double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> remains on the surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also in this case. A support (not shown) corresponding to the support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be used for accommodating the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> separated from the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the first retaining device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provided thereon, as well as the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for the ejector pins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> also has holes whose positions correspond to those of the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As a result, the ejector pins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can exert a pressure on the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without detaching the third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has a configuration corresponding to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, with the fourth double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> taking the place of the third double-sided adhesive foil <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the bores <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> taking the place of the bores <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the ejector pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> taking the place of the ejector pins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In addition to the elements and the process steps performed thereby of the second embodiment, the arrangement of the present, third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> comprises a second ejector <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> which comprises a number of ejector pins <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> which may preferably be smaller than the number of ejector pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, thus constituting the change with respect to the second ejection device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The ejector pins <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are passed through holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. These may be arranged in addition to the holes <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for the pressure gas in the surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, or alternatively a number of the holes <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be used as holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the ejector pins <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The construction of the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> again essentially corresponds to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The sequence of the process steps in the third embodiment corresponds to that in the second embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows this third embodiment in a state comparable to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In addition to the process steps described for the second embodiment, the ejector pins <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the second ejector <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are moved out, shown by the dark hatched arrow <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, after the separation of the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As a result, the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> already detached is lifted by the ejector pins <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, whereby in particular the spatial separation between the surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be increased in a simple and defined manner, and the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be removed from the second retaining device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, for example in the manner mentioned above on a second support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows a modification of a construction of a retaining device with respect to the example of the retaining device for the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in an arrangement with a magnet device and support elements in the form of planar sheets on rollers in a fourth embodiment. This modification of the retaining device is referenced <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> comprises an electromagnet on whose outer, at least substantially planar surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> a first moving track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> rests, preferably constructed as a continuous track of steel, which is arranged around two rollers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and can be rotated around the latter. The second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> lies on this first moving track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which furthermore preferably is coated with an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, for example a double-sided adhesive foil, on its surface facing away from the electromagnets. The second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is here constructed from a ferromagnetic material so that it can be attracted by the electromagnets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In a modification of this embodiment, the retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> may alternatively be used as the first retaining device for the first workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, there is the possibility of depositing the workpiece carriers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> directly on the surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the electromagnet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, leaving out the first moving track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The process steps in this fourth embodiment of the invention correspond substantially to those of the embodiments described further above. A variation, however, is found in the process step of separating the workpiece carrier&mdash;here the workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&mdash;from the retaining devices&mdash;here the (second) retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. This is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows, the electromagnet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is switched on for retaining the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> during the separation of the first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The magnetic attraction is symbolized by a dark hatched arrow <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The adhesive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> on the first moving track provides an additional fixation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the arrangement with the retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the first moving track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the workpiece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a diagrammatic plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> After the separation of the first adhesive <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the electromagnet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is switched off, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, and the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is detached from the retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> thereby. The switching-off of the electromagnet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is symbolized by the absence of hatching in the arrow <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The first moving track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is rotated for separating the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the retaining device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, whereby the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is removed from the effective range of the electromagnet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is moved from the first moving track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> owing to the rolling movement thereof down onto a second moving track <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, whereby at the same time the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is automatically detached. The second moving track is preferably permeable to air and constructed without an adhesive layer and serves for further transport of the second workpiece carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The arrows <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> indicate the direction of movement of the moving tracks <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> during rolling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In further modifications of the embodiments shown, the methods and devices for fastening the workpiece carriers to the retaining devices and for separating the workpiece carriers from the retaining devices may alternatively be combined such that different arrangements and methods are used for the first and the second retaining device. In addition to further possibilities, for example, a second retaining device in accordance with the fourth embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be combined with a first retaining device in accordance with the second embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
