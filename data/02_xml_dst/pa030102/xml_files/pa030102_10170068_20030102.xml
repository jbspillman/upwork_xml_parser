<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a device, which has programmable set points for a vehicle/equipment signal, generated by the operational time, distance or condition parameters, in order to transmit when the set-point measurements are reached. The measurement is transmitted by wireless to inform by email: that the multi set-points are reached and provides the predetermined documented maintenance/service activities required as at the set point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When a vehicle or equipment is operating, service becomes due based on time, distance or condition and there is a requirement for prescribed maintenance. When it is operated intermittently, if the equipment is not in a fixed location, management may not be aware that the period is reached apart from repeated manual checks. Thus the device being invented triggers an alert as the set point is reached and sends a message by wireless to avoid the repeated manual checks to determine when the service requirements are due. The ability to be alerted when the set point is reached makes the management of maintenance more proactive and allows for planning the activities, (availability of service resources) when dealing with off-site (as in the case of equipment rentals) or non-stationary situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Managers of equipment have extreme difficulty in tracking the distance, time or condition, when maintenance is due. In owner-operated vehicles, a sticker is placed on the glass to inform the user that service is due. In other cases a warning light comes on to advise that engine service is required. However there are circumstances, which mitigate against these being an effective method and relate to off-site or remote conditions. Examples of these situations are as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 1. &lsquo;Engine service&rsquo; does not defined the other activities that need to be attended to on the vehicle. e.g transmission oil change, and other checks or monitoring requirements, which may have other predetermined timeframes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 2. Engine (Diesel/IC) driven equipment (compressors, cranes, rigs), which is rented out cannot inform the &lsquo;rentor&rsquo; in a timely fashion when the scheduled service is due, as measured by hours, distance or condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 3. Tractor Engine rigs driven across country far away from the owners, who are unaware when the service period has been reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 4. The service schedule usually consists of several activities. These take place as per parameters of time, condition or distance. The list of activities is usually not available on the occasion when the prescribed parameters are reached if away from the home base.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows a signal to be generated for equipment/machinery/vehicle critical set points for any of the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> the length of time for operations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> distance traveled </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> its condition status </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The device allows the transmission of a measurement signal wirelessly, in order to inform the assigned responsible person, that the prescribed maintenance has become due. When the set point is approached, reached or exceeded, the device enables access via its wireless capability, to the database of service activities for selecting the predetermined activities, for forwarding by email. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> E.g At 250 running hours a crane may require the monitoring of cables, at 3000 miles a compressor may require a filter change, a portable compressor may have an oil change condition signal, like a flashing light. When such equipment is out in the field, those responsible for the maintenance may not know when these parameters are reached. They may not have the list of activities at hand. A generated signal, which is informed when these are reached and has the capability to send wirelessly, provides an advantage for the useful management of resources and assurances that the maintenance is timely indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus, a new generation of network communications can alert owners and managers of the equipment maintenance requirements. The alert is based on the prescribed intervals of time, distance or condition via cellular telephone, wireless communications and Internet access via a wireless communication link. This provides a rich networking topology that allows those responsible for managing the maintenance, to keep abreast of the timeliness of execution, since the equipment may not within their direct immediate control, when the time, distanced traveled or required condition status is arrived at. E.g Portable compressors leased or rented, away from its base location, This leads to enhanced longevity of equipment due to timely maintenance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention involves the ability to transmit information from equipment to the responsible person, delivered via wireless, that maintenance is due based on its time, distance or condition is reached. The invention consists of: A device which has the capability to program the equipment identification, have multi set points, and the means to trigger a signal when the programmed set point is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The programmable set point IC and measuring IC make up a full operational component with the wireless modem. As a component it is mounted on the unit to interact with the network, either by WAN, LAN or wireless network communication techniques. This can be accomplished by linking the said measuring IC/modem combination to provide the signal for the wireless technology for sending the email or alert by any other means for service information from the maintenance database.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At this point it would be appropriate and helpful to review the topic of wireless networks to better understand the present invention. In wireless network communications, data is carried over radio waves or by means of infrared light. There are a plethora of standards built around IEEE 802.11 standards and TCP/IP protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A wireless LANs similar to cellular networks will be used with several wireless access points connected to a standard Ethernet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Out-of-office networking technology, as represented by radio modems, is quite amenable for use in the present invention. It is referred to as cellular digital packet data (CDPD), which enables a user to send data packets using a cellular network, similar to what is used for cellular telephones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides the ability to deliver time, distance, or condition-based information from equipment at the pre set points via wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus, a new generation of network unit communications with cellular telephone, wireless communications and Internet access, via wireless communication link provides the information alert for due maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is provided merely for purposes of general background. It represents a typical block diagram of a data processing system including a PLC timer unit and network connections via a communications adapter, which is capable of implementing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A central processing unit (CPU), such as one of the PowerPC microprocessors available is used for programming the set points based and identification to inform which unit delivers the alert parameters for maintenance. The appropriate software will facilitate the set point setting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The device is hooked up to the equipment for two reasons: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 1. To provide a power source </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 2. To draw a signal from the CAN when the vehicle is in operation to determine the operating time, distance or engine condition of equipment/vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 2.1 The operating time as per the timer, is matched against the set points and at these points an electronic signal is triggered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 2.2 The mileage as per the odometer is matched against the set points and at the predetermined points a signal is triggered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 2.3 The condition is matched against the on board condition system, for the condition signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The signal is sent to the wireless modem, which sends a signal to the telecommunications network, for sending e-mail to the maintenance management that the particular set point has been reached for the required maintenance activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
