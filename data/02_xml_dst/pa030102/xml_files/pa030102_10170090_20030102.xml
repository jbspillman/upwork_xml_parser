<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a support wheel arrangement for an agricultural working machine and to an agricultural working machine provided therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> German patent document DE 199 18 551 discloses an agricultural harvesting machine formed as a forage harvester which at its front side has an intermediate attachment that receives an agricultural working device. For preventing a support of the load of the agricultural working device exclusively over the carrier vehicle axle located forwardly in the traveling direction, at least in one embodiment support wheels are associated with the intermediate attachment. Thereby during street travel at least a part of the mass of the agricultural working device is supported on the ground through the support wheels. This has first of all the advantage that the front side carrier vehicle axle during the street travel must not support the total load of the adapted agricultural working device. The adaptation of the support wheels on the intermediate attachment of the agricultural working machine requires however an increased rigidity of this intermediate attachment, since during the travel over uneven terrain significant impact loads can occur, that must be taken by the intermediate attachment. During the operation on the field the intermediate attachment of such agricultural harvesting machines as a rule sinks to a near-ground position, so that the support wheels which are arranged on the intermediate attachment can contact the ground. When the loads which are supported on the ground by the relatively small support wheels are high, then due to their small contact surface this can lead to significant ground pressures which significantly worsens the growth conditions of the plants. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a support wheel arrangement for agricultural working machines and to provide an agricultural working machine provided therewith, which eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art and ensure low ground pressure also in the region of a support wheel or support wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In keeping with these objects and with others which will become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention resides, briefly stated, in a support wheel arrangement in which at least one support wheel is arranged before at least one land wheel of an axle of the agricultural harvesting machine as considered in a traveling direction, and the at least one support wheel and the rearwardly arranged land wheel are surrounded by a common envelope means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is another feature of the present invention to provide a an agricultural working machine which has at least one receiving device for receiving an agricultural working device, at least one support wheel arrangeable in a region facing the agricultural working device, the at least one support wheel being arranged forwardly of the at least one land wheel of an axle as considered in a traveling direction, and a common envelope means surrounding the at least one support wheel and the land wheel located after the at least one support wheel as considered in the traveling direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since in accordance with the present invention, at least one support wheel arranged in the region of the receiving device is located before the land wheel of the neighboring axle of the agricultural working machine and the associated support wheel and the land wheel are surrounded together by the envelope means, each support wheel and one land wheel of the neighboring vehicle axle forms a crawler track assembly that reduces the ground pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferable embodiment of the present invention, the support wheels are arranged at both sides of the receiving device. Thereby at least two crawler track assemblies can be arranged collision-free on the agricultural harvesting machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The support wheels can be arranged centrally of the corresponding land wheels. This guarantees an interference-free rotation of the envelope means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Depending on the embodiment of the envelope means, the support wheels in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention can have a width which either is equal to the width of the corresponding land wheels or is smaller than their width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an advantageous further embodiment of the invention, the support wheels can be operatively connected with the receiving device and/or the agricultural harvesting machine in a height-adjustable manner. Thereby the support wheel which is located forwardly in the traveling direction can be lifted during the travel on a loose ground to counteract a so-called &ldquo;mud displacement&rdquo; which occurs with crawler track assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The height adjustment can be provided in a structurally simple manner when the support wheels are in operative connection with the receiving device of the agricultural harvesting machine through a lifting cylinder unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The inventive envelope means can be formed in a specially simple manner, when the envelope means is formed by known rubber chains or crawler chains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to increase the universality of the agricultural harvesting machine, in accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention the envelope means can be removed, so that the support wheels and the land wheels of the same axle of the agricultural working machine can be operated without the envelope means. This first of all provides the advantage when the agricultural harvesting machine must move on even and rigid soil such as streets with high traveling speed, since the crawler track assembly allows only conditionally of the high traveling speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The support wheels can be formed as steerable support wheels whose steering can be blocked during crawler operation. Thereby the agricultural harvesting machine can be operated either with the crawler track assembly or separate support and land wheels, and during operation with support and land wheels a high maneuverability can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention the support wheels can be supported by supporting frames which connect the support wheels through carrier arms both with the agricultural harvesting machine and with the receiving device, and at least the carrier arms which connect the support wheels with the agricultural harvesting machine is formed telescopable. In this case it is possible to use the support frames which receive the support wheels simultaneously as a clamping device for the corresponding envelope means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The novel features which are considered as characteristic for the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an agricultural harvesting machine which is formed as a harvester thresher <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In its front region it has a swivel axle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending transversely to a traveling direction FR. It supports a receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed as a known inclined conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, turnably in a vertical direction. Holding flanges <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed on the lower side of the inclined conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. They support the front ends of piston rods <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> turnably about an axis <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> extending transversely to the traveling direction FR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At the side of the carrier vehicle, the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are arranged so that they are turnably movable on the agricultural harvesting machine around axes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which extend also transversely to the traveling direction FR. When the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are loaded with pressure or unloaded from pressure, the piston rods <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> move out of the cylinders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or are retracted into them. As a result, the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> performs a turning movement in a vertical direction around the axle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> arranged on the carrier vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition to performing the turning movement of the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> also have the function of supporting the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the carrier vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An agricultural working device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is arranged at the front side of the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is formed as a grain cutting track assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such a working device is known and therefore not illustrated in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid the situation that the load of the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the agricultural working device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> adapted to it is not transmitted exclusively through the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the carrier vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the region of its front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are arranged at both sides of the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the region between the grain cutting track assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the harvester thresher <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A rear axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of each support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is surrounded by a hub <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A receiving flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed on its inner side end located in the region of the support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A vertical turning axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is formed in the simplest case as an axially secured pin <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and extends in a vertical direction, passes through the receiving flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In a rim region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the vertical axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also passes through a guiding lug <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which in turn is mounted on a first inventive carrier arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the shown embodiment such a carrier arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is associated with each support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Each carrier arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at its end which supports the corresponding support wheel is associated with each support wheel is <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed as an arbitrarily shaped head member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. At the carrier vehicle, an angle profile carrier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is welded to the head member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It has a cross-section which increases in direction toward the front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the carrier vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Front holding flanges <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are associated with the front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the agricultural working machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the simplest case axles <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which extend transversely to the traveling direction FR and formed as axlely secured pins <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, extend through the holding flange <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Flange-shaped extension <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the angle profile carrier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> extend through the distance between the neighboring holding flanges <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that the corresponding pins <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> support the associated angle profile carriers <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> turnably in a vertical direction. In this way the at least one first carrier arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the supporting flame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected turnably movable with the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the region of its front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A holding bracket <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed on the head member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the first carrier arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the side facing away from the corresponding support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The corresponding holding axle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> supports the front-side end of the piston rod <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a lifting cylinder unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> turnably about an axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending transversely to the traveling direction FR. The cylinder end of the lifting cylinder unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is mounted on the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the agricultural harvesting machine turnably about an axis <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which is also arranged transversely to the traveling direction FR. Therefore the corresponding lifting cylinder unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> forms a further carrier arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the support frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which connects at least one support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> turnably movable with the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the agricultural harvesting machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this way, each support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected both with the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and with the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the support frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is composed of the first carrier arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and at least one further carrier arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Within the spirit of the present invention, the support frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is formed of the two parts in the illustrated embodiment can be also composed of one part. Such one-part supporting frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is arranged turnably on the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through one or several turning axes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> arranged transversely to the traveling direction FR. It is also possible to support the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through only one lifting cylinder unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or any number of the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Since the second carrier arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed as lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> it is guaranteed that the association of the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a vertical direction can be changed. Thereby the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can always contact the ground <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> independently from the position of the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention a steering lever <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> engages the pin <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which forms the vertical swivel axis <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as shown at an upper side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A stud <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extending in a vertical direction is associated with the steering lever <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The carrier arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which supports the corresponding support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided at its and associated with the front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a stud <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending in a vertical direction. An angular lever <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is turnably arranged on the stud <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of studs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are non rotatably associated with it. A first coupling rod <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connects the stud <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the steering lever <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> turnably with a stud <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> arranged on the angle lever <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The coupling rod <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extends in direction of the front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the agricultural harvesting machine above and in the region of the angle profile carrier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the corresponding carrier arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the steering lever <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the coupling rod <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the angular levers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are associated with the neighboring support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> mirror-symmetrically relative to one another. They form correspondingly a partial steering mechanism <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for the corresponding support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In the region of the front axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the both partial steering mechanisms <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are coupled with one another through a connecting brace <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is turnably connected with the rearward stud <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the angular lever <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. A steering cylinder <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is turnably associated with the angular lever <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> through a further stud <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Its another end is supported also turnably about a vertical axle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by a holding flange <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is mounted on the angle profile carrier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When the pressure acts in the double-acting steering cylinder <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the piston rod <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is extended from the steering cylinder <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> or is retracted into it, and therefore the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> perform identically directed turning movements about their vertical turning axles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to assure that when the agricultural working device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is not provided the inventive support wheels support an average load on the ground <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which turn the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed as double-acting lifting cylinder units. Therefore, with the piston rod <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> retracted in the cylinder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the cylinder piston unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the height can be fixed at which the load supported on the ground <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> must be located. When the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which turn the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed as single-acting units, a pulling cylinder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can be arranged between the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Under the pressure action, the inventive support wheels are forced to the bottom <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and the magnitude of the load to be supported is determinable by the pressure action of the pulling cylinder-piston unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, in the shown embodiment each support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged centrally of the land wheels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the front-side axle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and forwardly as considered in the traveling direction FR. Each of the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which are arranged at both sides of the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is an operative connection with the rearwardly located land wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through an envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Therefore the support wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the corresponding land wheel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the associated envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> formed in accordance with the present invention form a crawler track assembly <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the land wheels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which are connected with one another by the envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can have identical or different widths. In a not shown manner, also several support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> arranged near one another can be connected with a single land wheel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> through the envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This embodiment is preferable when the width of the support wheels is significantly smaller than the widths of the land wheels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and for a reliable guidance of the envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> approximately identical widths of the support wheels and the land wheels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which are in operative connection with them, must be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the simplest case the inventive envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be formed as known crawler chains or rubber chains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For operating the above described steerable support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as the crawler track assembly <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, it is required that the steering cylinder <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> must be blockable in a known manner. It is possible in this manner to operate the steerable support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the following land wheels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> independently from one another or as the crawler track assembly <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> coupled with one another. This has the advantage that the agricultural harvesting machine during its use on the field can be activated so as to finely treat the ground with the crawler track assembly <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, while during traveling on a street for achieving higher traveling speeds it can be operated with the separate support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the rearward land wheels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Since the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are articulately connected through the lifting cylinder units <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the agricultural harvesting machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is possible by pressure loading/pressure unloading of the lifting cylinder unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which holds the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the receiving device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, to provide a vertical relative movement of the support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with respect to the land wheels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. This has the advantage that the front-side support wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be lifted during the use in the field, so as to reduce or completely eliminate sliding of ground components <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the front region of the crawler track assembly <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, that worsens the traveling properties of crawler track assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The rotatably envelope means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are subjected to a gradual stretching with increasing operational time. Therefore, in accordance with a preferable embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the angle profile carrier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the support arms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be composed of a first carrier segment <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and at least one second carrier segment <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The carrier segments <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> can be displaced relative to one another in a known and not shown way. This displacing movement can be dampened in a simple case under the action of a spring, so that on the one hand the envelope means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is always tensioned and on the other hand impact loads reaching in the corresponding crawler track assembly <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> can be dampened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other types of constructions differing from the types described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in support wheel arrangement for agricultural working machine, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention.</paragraph>
