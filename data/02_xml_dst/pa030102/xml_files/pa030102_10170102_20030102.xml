<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cells must maintain proper intracellular solute concentrations to remain viable. Most substances are unable to move through the cytoplasmic membrane in a passive manner, necessitating active transport. Membrane transport proteins (transporters) facilitate the transport process and serve to maintain proper intracellular solute concentrations. Generally, transporters span the cellular membrane, with portions of the protein being exposed to both the cytoplasm and to the external environment. As a result of their critical function, transporters are important targets for therapeutic intervention (Berger et al., <highlight><italic>The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology, </italic></highlight>1: 107-138 (2000)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Active transporters have the ability to move substances across membranes against chemical or electrical gradients (Wolfe S. L., <highlight><italic>Molecular and Cellular Biology, </italic></highlight>205 (1993)). Such transport requires the input of cellular energy. Generally, the required energy is derived from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A type of transporter, known as an ATP-dependent transporter or P-type ATPase, is directly energized by the hydrolysis of ATP. Eukaryotic P-type ATPases have been characterized as a single polypeptide containing eight to ten transmembrane helices, wherein the single polypeptide carries out all functions associated with the transporter, including ATP hydrolysis, phosphate binding, and movement of a substance across the membrane (Wolfe S. L., <highlight><italic>Molecular and Cellular Biology </italic></highlight>(1993)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The E1-E2 (or P-type) ATPases are ion transport enzymes and have been identified in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most maintain physiological gradients of common cations through a process of active transport, as reviewed in Lehninger, A. H. (1982) <highlight><italic>Principles of Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>chapter 14. Members of this superfamily include calcium transporting ATPases, sodium/potassium ATPases, and proton ATPases. The calcium pump in muscle cells sequesters calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum to effect muscle relaxation. The Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> ATPase of cell membranes maintains a gradient of high sodium, low potassium outside the cell and low sodium, high potassium inside the cell to maintain osmotic balance in the face of high intracellular protein concentration. The proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach lining maintains stomach pH at 1.0 by the transport of H<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>into the stomach. New members of the E1-E2 ATPase family include aminophospholipid translocases (or phospholipid transport ATPase, Tang et al., (1996) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>272: 1495-1497; Bull, L. N. et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Nat. Genet. </italic></highlight>18:219-224; Mauro, I. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </italic></highlight>257:333-339). These ATPases maintain the lipid composition of cell membranes. With this function, these ATPases participate in membrane recognition events, such as in blood coagulation, apoptosis of lymphocytes, synaptic vesicle fusion and bile acid secretion. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A plasmid containing the nucleotide sequence encoding human 67108 (clone &ldquo;Fbh67108FL&rdquo;) was deposited with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, on ______ and assigned Accession Number ______. This deposit will be maintained under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure. This deposit was made merely as a convenience for those of skill in the art and is not an admission that a deposit is required under 35 U.S.C. &sect;112. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The 67108 protein contains a significant number of structural characteristics in common with members of the phospholipid transporter family. The term &ldquo;family&rdquo; when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the invention means two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin, or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Phospholipid transporter family members are characterized by the presence of about ten transmembrane helices with large cytoplasmic domains between the second and third transmembrane domains, and between the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains, similar to the structure of the P-type ion transporters. Phospholipid transporters typically include one or more consensus sequences considered characteristic of the family members: the first sequence is implicated in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to transport, the second sequence includes the aspartate phosphorylated in the enzyme intermediate, and the third may participate in ATP binding. The extracytosolic domains of the ATPase are typically quite small (Tang et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>272:1495-1497 (1996)). An example of a phospholipid transporter is human ATPase II (GenBank Accession No. AB013452, SEQ ID NO:4). A GAP alignment of the 67108 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2 with human ATPase 11 resulted in 40.2% identity as measured in a matrix made by matblas from blosum62.iij. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A 67108 polypeptide can include a &ldquo;phospholipid transporter domain&rdquo; or regions homologous with a &ldquo;phospholipid transporter domain&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;phospholipid transporter&rdquo; includes a protein or polypeptide that is capable of transporting a molecule, e.g. phospholipids, such as, for example, aminophosphospholipids, e.g. phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine or cholinephospholipids, e.g. phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, across cell membranes. Phospholipid transporters are believed to maintain the asymmetric distribution of phospholipid types between the inner and outer leaflets of the cell membrane. Loss of asymmetry can, for example, serve as a signal for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by activated human monocytes. Thus, phospholipid transporters may play a role in or function in a variety of cellular processes, e.g., phospholipid transport, absorption, secretion, gene expression, intra- or inter-cellular signaling, and/or cellular proliferation, growth, and/or differentiation. As the 67108 molecules of the present invention may modulate phospholipid transporter mediated activities, these molecules may be useful for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents for phospholipid transporter associated disorders, as described in more detail below. </paragraph>

(1999), <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>27:263-267). The ProDom protein domain database consists of an automatic compilation of homologous domains. Current versions of ProDom are built using recursive PSI-BLAST searches (Altschul et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>25:3389-3402; Gouzy et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Computers and Chemistry </italic></highlight>23:333-340) of the SWISS-PROT 38 and TREMBL protein databases. The database automatically generates a consensus sequence for each domain. A BLAST search was performed against the HMM database resulting in the identification of &ldquo;phospholipid-transporting&rdquo; domains in the amino acid sequence of human 67108 at about residues 4 to 85, 123 to 170, 171 to 278, 224 to 365, 572 to 794, 831 to 890, 893 to 977, and 977 to 1089 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>

Transmembrane domains are described in, for example, Zagotta W. N. et al, (1996) <highlight><italic>Annual Rev.

The C-terminal amino acid residue of an &ldquo;N-terminal cytoplasmic domain&rdquo; is adjacent to an N-terminal amino acid residue of a transmembrane domain in a 67108 protein. For example, an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is located at about amino acid residues 1 to 53 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a 67108 polypeptide or protein has an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain or a region which includes about 1 to 125, preferably about 1 to 85, and more preferably about 1 to 75 or 1-53 amino acid residues and has at least about 60%, 70% 80% 90% 95%, 99%, or 100% homology with an &ldquo;N-terminal cytoplasmic domain,&rdquo; e.g., the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human 67108 (e.g., residues 1 to 53 of SEQ ID NO:2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the 67108 cytoplasmic regions include at least one, two, three, preferably four cytoplasmic loops.

Accordingly, the N-terminal amino acid of a loop is adjacent to a C-terminal amino acid of a transmembrane domain in a 67108 molecule, and the C-terminal amino acid of a loop is adjacent to an N-terminal amino acid of a transmembrane domain in a 67108 molecule. As used herein, a &ldquo;cytoplasmic loop&rdquo; includes a loop located inside of a cell or within the cytoplasm of a cell. For example, a &ldquo;cytoplasmic loop&rdquo; can be found at about amino acid residues 94 to 275, 345 to 880, 926 to 954, and 1013 to 1022, of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> 67108 polypeptides have at least one, and preferably two long cytoplasmic domains, which are characteristic of phospholipid transporters.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a 67108 polypeptide or protein has a cytoplasmic loop or a region which includes at least about 6, preferably about 10 to 550, and more preferably about 12 to 510 amino acid residues and has at least about 60%, 70% 80% 90% 95%, 99%, or 100% homology with a cytoplasmic loop,&rdquo; e.g., a cytoplasmic loop of human 67108 (e.g., residues 94 to 275, 345 to 880, 926 to 954, and 1013 to 1022 of SEQ ID NO:2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the 67108 non-transmembrane regions include at least one, two, three, four, preferably five non-cytoplasmic loops. As used herein, a &ldquo;non-cytoplasmic loop&rdquo; includes an amino acid sequence located outside of a cell or within an intracellular organelle. Non-cytoplasmic loops include extracellular domains (i.e., outside of the cell) and intracellular domains (i.e., within the cell). When referring to membrane-bound proteins found in intracellular organelles (e.g., mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes microsomes, vesicles, endosomes, and lysosomes), non-cytoplasmic loops include those domains of the protein that reside in the lumen of the organelle or the matrix or the intermembrane space. Members of the phospholipid transporter family typically reside on the plasma membrane, so the non-cytoplasmic loops are &ldquo;extracellular.&rdquo; For example, a &ldquo;non-cytoplasmic loop&rdquo; can be found at about amino acid residues 71 to 76, 299 to 319, 899 to 904, 979 to 993, and 1040 to 1066 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>

For example, a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is located at about amino acid residues 1086 to 1192 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a 67108 polypeptide or protein has a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain or a region which includes at least about 50, preferably about 75 to 125, more preferably about 100 to 110 amino acid residues and has at least about 60%, 70% 80% 90% 95%, 99%, or 100% homology with a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain,&rdquo; e.g., the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human 67108 (e.g., residues 1086 to 1192 of SEQ ID NO:2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A 67108 phospholipid transporter also can include a coiled coil structure. Coiled coil structures are supercoiled helical domains responsible for the oligomerization of proteins.

Biol. </italic></highlight>122:17-29). Coiled coil structures are found in a wide variety of proteins, including cytoskeletal, nuclear, muscle, cell surface, extracellular, plasma, bacterial, and viral proteins and can be found in the 67108 polypeptide at about amino acids 612 to 719 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As the 67108 polypeptides of the invention may modulate 67108-mediated activities, they may be useful for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents for 67108-mediated or related disorders, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;phospholipid transporter-associated activity&rdquo; includes an activity which involves participation in regulating a variety of cellular processes, e.g., hydrolysis of ATP, phospholipid transport (e.g., aminophospholipid transport), absorption, secretion, gene expression, intra- or inter-cellular signaling, and/or cellular proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and/or differentiation. These transporters maintain the lipid composition of cell membranes. With this function, these transporters participate in membrane recognition events, such as in blood coagulation, apoptosis of lymphocytes, synaptic vesicle fusion and bile acid secretion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;67108 activity&rdquo;, &ldquo;biological activity of 67108&rdquo; or &ldquo;functional activity of 67108&rdquo;, refers to an activity exerted by a 67108 protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule. For example, a 67108 activity can be an activity exerted by 67108 in a physiological milieu on, e.g., a 67108-responsive cell or on a 67108 substrate, e.g., a protein substrate. A 67108 activity can be determined in vivo or in vitro. In one embodiment, a 67108 activity is a direct activity, such as an association with a 67108 target molecule. A &ldquo;target molecule&rdquo; or &ldquo;binding partner&rdquo; is a molecule with which a 67108 protein binds or interacts in nature. In an exemplary embodiment, 67108 is a transporter, e.g., a phospholipid transporter family member, and thus binds to or interacts in nature with molecule, e.g., a phospholipid (e.g., an aminophospholipid such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, a choline phospholipid such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, and a bile acid). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A 67108 activity can also be an indirect activity, e.g., a cellular signaling activity mediated by interaction of the 67108 protein with a 67108 receptor. The features of the 67108 molecules of the present invention can provide similar biological activities as phospholipid transporter family members. For example, the 67108 proteins of the present invention can have one or more of the following activities: (1) the ability to anchor into a membrane, e.g., a cell membrane (e.g., a cardiovascular or a nerve cell membrane); (2) the ability to be transiently phosphorylated on an acidic (e.g., aspartate) residue; (3) the ability to modulate the phosphorylation state of a 67108 target molecule (e.g., an ATP molecule) by, e.g., inducing ATP hydrolysis; (4) the ability to maintain a gradient, e.g., a molecular gradient (e.g., a phospholipid gradient), across a membrane; (5) the ability to transport phospholipids (e.g., aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, choline phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, and bile acids) across a membrane; (6) the ability to modulate the location of a substrate or target molecule (e.g., modulation of phospholipid location within a cell and/or location with respect to a cellular membrane); (7) the ability to modulate apoptosis or cell death; (8) the ability to modulate immune cell activity; (9) the ability to modulate blood coagulation; (10) the ability to modulate energy metabolism; (11) the ability to modulate organ function; (12) the ability to modulate neuronal activity, e.g., neuron stimulation; (13) the ability to modulate the activity of one or more proteins involved in cellular growth, proliferation, or differentiation, e.g., cardiac, epithelial, or neuronal cell growth, proliferation or differentiation; (14) the ability to modulate cancer or tumor progression; and (15) the ability to modulate tissue development (e.g. embryogenesis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thus, the 67108 molecules of the present invention can participate in one or more of the following processes: (1) the regulation membrane phospholipid composition; (2) the modulation of blood coagulation; (3) the modulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, growth, absorption or secretion; (4) modulation of cell death; and (5) the regulation of metabolic pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;phospholipid transporter-associated disorder&rdquo;, includes a disorder, disease, or condition characterized by a deregulation, e.g., an upregulation or a downregulation, of a phospholipid transporter involved in cellular membrane structure. In a preferred embodiment, a phospholipid transporter-associated disorder includes the inhibition or over-stimulation of the activity of phospholipid transporter involved in, e.g., phospholipid transport associated with cellular membrane formation and/or maintenance. Such fluctuations in membrane composition can lead to perturbed membrane structure, which can in turn lead membrane structure-related disorders. Cellular membrane structure deregulation may be due to, or result in, a deregulation or misregulation of cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation (e.g., cellular growth related disorders), cell metabolism, cellular hypertrophy, inter- or intra-cellular communication; tissue function, such as cardiac function or musculoskeletal function; systemic responses in an organism, such as nervous system responses, hormonal responses (e.g., insulin response), or immune responses; and protection of cells from toxic compounds (e.g., carcinogens, toxins, or mutagens). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Thus, the 67108 molecules can act as novel diagnostic targets and therapeutic agents for controlling one or more phospholipid transporter, e.g., cellular membrane-related disorders. Examples of such disorders, e.g., phospholipid transporter-associated or other 67108-associated disorders, include but are not limited to, blood coagulation disorders; apoptotic disorders; immune (e.g. inflammatory) disorders; hormonal disorders, disorders involving aberrant vesicle function and/or formation, such as neurological disorders (e.g. brain disorders, as described below); disorders of inter- or intra-cellular communication; tissue function, such as cardiac function or musculoskeletal function; and cellular proliferation, growth, or differentiation disorders. Examples of cellular growth related disorders include cardiovascular disorders, such as heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, or angina; proliferative disorders or differentiative disorders, such as cancer, e.g., melanoma, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, sarcoma, lymphoma or leukemia. Examples of cell-cell communication or cell metabolism disorders include neurological disorders (e.g. brain disorders, as described below, including mitochondrial encephalomyelopathies); leukodystrophies; immune or inflammatory disorders; and metabolic ion balance disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, hypertension or atrial fibrillation. These and other disorders are described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules can be used to treat blood coagulation disorders, in part because phospholipid transporters are involved in membrane recognition events such as blood coagulation. Blood coagulation disorders include, but are not limited to, disorders resulting from aberrant or deficient platelet function, such as thrombocytopenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome or thrombasthenia, disorders involving aberrant or deficient clotting factors, such as hemophilia or von Willebrand&apos;s disease, or disorders resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation, such as obstetric complications, infections, neoplastic diseases or traumatic tissue injuries. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules can be used to treat neurological disorders, in part because phospholipid transporters are involved in membrane specialization and/or recognition events such as synaptic vesicle formation and vesicle fusion.

Examples of such cells include cells having an abnormal state or condition characterized by rapidly proliferating cell growth. Hyperproliferative and neoplastic disease states may be categorized as pathologic, i.e., characterizing or constituting a disease state, or may be categorized as non-pathologic, i.e., a deviation from normal but not associated with a disease state. The term is meant to include all types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes, metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed cells, tissues, or organs, irrespective of histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. &ldquo;Pathologic hyperproliferative&rdquo; cells occur in disease states characterized by malignant tumor growth. Examples of non-pathologic hyperproliferative cells include proliferation of cells associated with wound repair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; or &ldquo;neoplasms&rdquo; include malignancies of the various organ systems, such as affecting lung, breast, thyroid, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, and genito-urinary tract, as well as adenocarcinomas which include malignancies such as most colon cancers, renal-cell carcinoma, prostate cancer and/or testicular tumors, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the small intestine and cancer of the esophagus. </paragraph>

A hematopoietic neoplastic disorder can arise from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof. Preferably, the diseases arise from poorly differentiated acute leukemias, e.g., erythroblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Additional exemplary myeloid disorders include, but are not limited to, acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus, L.

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The 67108 protein, fragments thereof, and derivatives and other variants of the sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 thereof are collectively referred to as &ldquo;polypeptides or proteins of the invention&rdquo; or &ldquo;67108 polypeptides or proteins&rdquo;. Nucleic acid molecules encoding such polypeptides or proteins are collectively referred to as &ldquo;nucleic acids of the invention&rdquo; or &ldquo;67108 nucleic acids.&rdquo; 67108 molecules refer to 67108 nucleic acids, polypeptides, and antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;nucleic acid molecule&rdquo; includes DNA molecules (e.g., a cDNA or genomic DNA), RNA molecules (e.g., an mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA. A DNA or RNA analog can be synthesized from nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. </paragraph>

For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5&prime; and/or 3&prime; ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of 5&prime; and/or 3&prime; nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybridizes under low stringency, medium stringency, high stringency, or very high stringency conditions&rdquo; describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is incorporated by reference. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: 1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6&times; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&deg; C., followed by two washes in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50&deg; C. (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55&deg; C. for low stringency conditions); 2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6&times; SSC at about 45&deg; C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60&deg; C.; 3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6&times; SSC at about 45&deg; C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&deg; C.; and preferably 4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65&deg; C., followed by one or more washes at 0.2&times; SSC, 1% SDS at 65&deg; C. Very high stringency conditions (4) are the preferred conditions and the ones that should be used unless otherwise specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under a stringency condition described herein to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3, corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;naturally-occurring&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature. For example a naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule can encode a natural protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;gene&rdquo; and &ldquo;recombinant gene&rdquo; refer to nucleic acid molecules which include at least an open reading frame encoding a 67108 protein. The gene can optionally further include non-coding sequences, e.g., regulatory sequences and introns. Preferably, a gene encodes a mammalian 67108 protein or derivative thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; or &ldquo;purified&rdquo; polypeptide or protein is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. &ldquo;Substantially free&rdquo; means that a preparation of 67108 protein is at least 10% pure. In a preferred embodiment, the preparation of 67108 protein has less than about 30%, 20%, 10% and more preferably 5% (by dry weight), of non-67108 protein (also referred to herein as a &ldquo;contaminating protein&rdquo;), or of chemical precursors or non-67108 chemicals. When the 67108 protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The invention includes isolated or purified preparations of at least 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 milligrams in dry weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of 67108 without abolishing or substantially altering a 67108 activity. Preferably the alteration does not substantially alter the 67108 activity, e.g., the activity is at least 20%, 40%, 60%, 70% or 80% of wild-type. An &ldquo;essential&rdquo; amino acid residue is a residue that, when altered from the wild-type sequence of 67108, results in abolishing a 67108 activity such that less than 20% of the wild-type activity is present. For example, conserved amino acid residues in 67108 are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;conservative amino acid substitution&rdquo; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a 67108 protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a 67108 coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for 67108 biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;biologically active portion&rdquo; of a 67108 protein includes a fragment of a 67108 protein which participates in an interaction, e.g., an intramolecular or an inter-molecular interaction. An inter-molecular interaction can be a specific binding interaction or an enzymatic interaction (e.g., the interaction can be transient and a covalent bond is formed or broken). An inter-molecular interaction can be between a 67108 molecule and a non-67108 molecule or between a first 67108 molecule and a second 67108 molecule (e.g., a dimerization interaction). Biologically active portions of a 67108 protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the 67108 protein, e.g., the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, which include less amino acids than the full length 67108 proteins, and exhibit at least one activity of a 67108 protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the 67108 protein, e.g., hydrolysis of ATP or phospholipid transport. A biologically active portion of a 67108 protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 or more amino acids in length. Biologically active portions of a 67108 protein can be used as targets for developing agents which modulate a 67108 mediated activity, e.g., hydrolysis of ATP or phospholipid transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Calculations of homology or sequence identity between sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences, or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid &ldquo;identity&rdquo; is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid &ldquo;homology&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ((1970) <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>48:444-453) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A particularly preferred set of parameters (and the one that should be used unless otherwise specified) are a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller ((1989) CABIOS, 4:11-17) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid and protein sequences described herein can be used as a &ldquo;query sequence&rdquo; to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score&equals;100, wordlength&equals;12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to 67108 nucleic acid molecules of the invention.

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 67108 Nucleic Acid Fragments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can include only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3. For example, such a nucleic acid molecule can include a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a 67108 protein, e.g., an immunogenic or biologically active portion of a 67108 protein. A fragment can comprise those nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1, which encode a transmembrane domain of human 67108.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence that includes part, or all, of the coding region and extends into either (or both) the 5&prime; or 3&prime; noncoding region. Other embodiments include a fragment which includes a nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid fragment described herein. Nucleic acid fragments can encode a specific domain or site described herein or fragments thereof, particularly fragments thereof which are at least 46 amino acids in length.

A nucleic acid fragment can also include one or more domain, region, or functional site described herein. Thus, for example, a 67108 nucleic acid fragment can include a sequence corresponding to a transmembrane domain. A nucleic acid fragment of a 67108 protein can encode a domain, e.g. a phospholipid transporter domain or a fragment thereof, e.g. about amino acid residues 4 to 85, 123 to 170, or 831 to 890, of SEQ ID NO:2 and can thus be about 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 241, 243, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, or 180 nucleotides in length. A fragment of a 67108 protein can encode the E1-E2 phosphorylation site, i.e. a fragment can encode about amino acids 392 to 398 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid is a probe which is at least 5 or 10, and less than 200, more preferably less than 100, or less than 50, base pairs in length. It should be identical, or differ by 1, or less than in 5 or 10 bases, from a sequence disclosed herein. If alignment is needed for this comparison the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. &ldquo;Looped&rdquo; out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> A probe or primer can be derived from the sense or anti-sense strand of a nucleic acid which encodes: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> at least one non-cytoplasmic, non-transmembrane loop located at about amino acids 71 to 76, 299 to 319, 899 to 904, 979 to 993, and 1040 to 1066 of SEQ ID NO:2; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> at least one intracellular loop located at about amino acids 94 to 275, 345 to 880, 926 to 954, and 1013 to 1022, of SEQ ID NO:2; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> an N-terminal intracellular domain located at about amino acids 1 to 53 of SEQ ID NO:2; or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> one ATPase E1-E2 phosphorylation site from about amino acid 392 to 398 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid fragment can encode an epitope bearing region of a polypeptide described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid fragment encoding a &ldquo;biologically active portion of a 67108 polypeptide&rdquo; can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3, which encodes a polypeptide having a 67108 biological activity (e.g., the biological activities of the 67108 proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the 67108 protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the 67108 protein. For example, a nucleic acid fragment encoding a biologically active portion of 67108 can include an ATPase E1-E2 phosphorylation site from about amino acid 392 to 398 of SEQ ID NO:2. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a biologically active portion of a 67108 polypeptide can comprise a nucleotide sequence which is at least 138 or more nucleotides in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, a nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence which is about 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2800, 2900, 3000, 3100, 3200, 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900,4000, 4100, 4200, 4300, 4400, 4500, 4600, 4700, 4800, 4900, 5000 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under a stringency condition described herein to a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, or SEQ ID NO:3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> 67108 Nucleic Acid Variants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3. Such differences can be due to degeneracy of the genetic code (and result in a nucleic acid which encodes the same 67108 proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence disclosed herein. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs, by at least 1, but less than 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 amino acid residues that shown in SEQ ID NO:2. If alignment is needed for this comparison the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. &ldquo;Looped&rdquo; out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acids of the inventor can be chosen for having codons, which are preferred, or non-preferred, for a particular expression system. E.g., the nucleic acid can be one in which at least one codon, at preferably at least 10%, or 20% of the codons has been altered such that the sequence is optimized for expression in <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>yeast, human, insect, or CHO cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologs (different locus), and orthologs (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring-variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid differs from that of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3, e.g., as follows: by at least one but less than 10, 20, 30, or 40 nucleotides; at least one but less than 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the nucleotides in the subject nucleic acid. If necessary for this analysis the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. &ldquo;Looped&rdquo; out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Orthologs, homologs, and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art. These variants comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide that is 50%, at least about 55%, typically at least about 70-75%, more typically at least about 80-85%, and most typically at least about 90-95% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 or a fragment of this sequence. Such nucleic acid molecules can readily be identified as being able to hybridize under a stringency condition described herein, to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 or a fragment of the sequence. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to orthologs, homologs, and allelic variants of the 67108 cDNAs of the invention can further be isolated by mapping to the same chromosome or locus as the 67108 gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Preferred variants include those that are correlated with hydrolysis of ATP or phospholipid transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Allelic variants of 67108, e.g., human 67108, include both functional and non-functional proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the 67108 protein within a population that maintain the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP or bind and transport phospholipids. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, or substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally-occurring amino acid sequence variants of the 67108, e.g., human 67108, protein within a population that do not have the ability to bind to and hydrolyze ATP, or bind and transport phospholipids. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other 67108 family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the 67108 sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Antisense Nucleic Acid Molecules, Ribozymes and Modified 67108 Nucleic Acid Molecules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features an isolated nucleic acid molecule which is antisense to 67108. An &ldquo;antisense&rdquo; nucleic acid can include a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; nucleic acid encoding a protein, e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule or complementary to an mRNA sequence. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire 67108 coding strand, or to only a portion thereof (e.g., the coding region of human 67108 corresponding to SEQ ID NO:3). In another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule is antisense to a &ldquo;noncoding region&rdquo; of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding 67108 (e.g., the 5&prime; and 3&prime; untranslated regions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> An antisense nucleic acid can be designed such that it is complementary to the entire coding region of 67108 mRNA, but more preferably is an oligonucleotide which is antisense to only a portion of the coding or noncoding region of 67108 mRNA. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be complementary to the region surrounding the translation start site of 67108 mRNA, e.g., between the &minus;10 and &plus;10 regions of the target gene nucleotide sequence of interest. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, or more nucleotides in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> An antisense nucleic acid of the invention can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. The antisense nucleic acid also can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned in an antisense orientation (i.e., RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest, described further in the following subsection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention are typically administered to a subject (e.g., by direct injection at a tissue site), or generated in situ such that they hybridize with or bind to cellular mRNA and/or genomic DNA encoding a 67108 protein to thereby inhibit expression of the protein, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or translation. Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid molecules can be modified to target selected cells and then administered systemically. For systemic administration, antisense molecules can be modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid molecules to peptides or antibodies which bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid molecules can also be delivered to cells using the vectors described herein. To achieve sufficient intracellular concentrations of the antisense molecules, vector constructs in which the antisense nucleic acid molecule is placed under the control of a strong pol II or pol III promoter are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule of the invention is an &agr;-anomeric nucleic acid molecule. An &agr;-anomeric nucleic acid molecule forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual &bgr;-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids. Res. </italic></highlight>15:6625-6641). The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2&prime;-o-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>15:6131-6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>215:327-330). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, an antisense nucleic acid of the invention is a ribozyme. A ribozyme having specificity for a 67108-encoding nucleic acid can include one or more sequences complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a 67108 cDNA disclosed herein (i.e., SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3), and a sequence having known catalytic sequence responsible for mRNA cleavage (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,246 or Haselhoff and Gerlach (1988) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>334:585-591). For example, a derivative of a Tetrahymena L-19 IVS RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved in a 67108-encoding mRNA. See, e.g., Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071; and Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,742. Alternatively, 67108 mRNA can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules. See, e.g., Bartel, D. and Szostak, J. W. (1993) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>261:1411-1418. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> 67108 gene expression can be inhibited by targeting nucleotide sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the 67108 (e.g., the 67108 promoter and/or enhancers) to form triple helical structures that prevent transcription of the 67108 gene in target cells. See generally, Helene, C. (1991) <highlight><italic>Anticancer Drug Des. </italic></highlight>6:569-84; Helene, C. i (1993) <highlight><italic>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>660:27-36; and Maher, L. J. (1992) <highlight><italic>Bioassays </italic></highlight>14:807-15. The potential sequences that can be targeted for triple helix formation can be increased by creating a so-called &ldquo;switchback&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule. Switchback molecules are synthesized in an alternating 5&prime;-3&prime;, 3&prime;-5&prime; manner, such that they base pair with first one strand of a duplex and then the other, eliminating the necessity for a sizeable stretch of either purines or pyrimidines to be present on one strand of a duplex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides detectably labeled oligonucleotide primer and probe molecules. Typically, such labels are chemiluminescent, fluorescent, radioactive, or colorimetric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> A 67108 nucleic acid molecule can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety or phosphate backbone to improve, e.g., the stability, hybridization, or solubility of the molecule. For non-limiting examples of synthetic oligonucleotides with modifications see Toulm&eacute; (2001) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>19:17 and Faria et al. (2001) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>19:40-44. Such phosphoramidite oligonucleotides can be effective antisense agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> For example, the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid molecules can be modified to generate peptide nucleic acids (see Hyrup B. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry </italic></highlight>4: 5-23). As used herein, the terms &ldquo;peptide nucleic acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;PNA&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid mimic, e.g., a DNA mimic, in which the deoxyribose phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and only the four natural nucleobases are retained. The neutral backbone of a PNA can allow for specific hybridization to DNA and RNA under conditions of low ionic strength. The synthesis of PNA oligomers can be performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols as described in Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra and Perry-O&apos;Keefe et al. <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>93: 14670-675. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> PNAs of 67108 nucleic acid molecules can be used in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. For example, PNAs can be used as antisense or antigene agents for sequence-specific modulation of gene expression by, for example, inducing transcription or translation arrest or inhibiting replication. PNAs of 67108 nucleic acid molecules can also be used in the analysis of single base pair mutations in a gene, (e.g., by PNA-directed PCR clamping); as &lsquo;artificial restriction enzymes&rsquo; when used in combination with other enzymes, (e.g., S1 nucleases (Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra)); or as probes or primers for DNA sequencing or hybridization (Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra; Perry-O&apos;Keefe supra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>84:648-652; PCT Publication No. WO88/09810) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO89/10134). In addition, oligonucleotides can be modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (see, e.g., Krol et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Bio-Techniques </italic></highlight>6:958-976) or intercalating agents. (see, e.g., Zon (1988) <highlight><italic>Phann. Res. </italic></highlight>5:539-549). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, (e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, or hybridization-triggered cleavage agent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes molecular beacon oligonucleotide primer and probe molecules having at least one region which is complementary to a 67108 nucleic acid of the invention, two complementary regions one having a fluorophore and one a quencher such that the molecular beacon is useful for quantitating the presence of the 67108 nucleic acid of the invention in a sample. Molecular beacon nucleic acids are described, for example, in Lizardi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033; Nazarenko et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,336, and Livak et al., U.S. Pat.

The polypeptide can be expressed in systems, e.g., cultured cells, which result in substantially the same post-translational modifications present when expressed the polypeptide is expressed in a native cell, or in systems which result in the alteration or omission of post-translational modifications, e.g., glycosylation or cleavage, present when expressed in a native cell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> it has the ability to modulate the location of a substrate or target molecule (e.g., modulation of phospholipid location within a cell and/or location with respect to a cellular membrane); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> it has a molecular weight, e.g., a deduced molecular weight, preferably ignoring any contribution of post translational modifications, amino acid composition or other physical characteristic of a 67108 polypeptide, e.g., a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> it has an overall sequence similarity of at least 60%, more preferably at least 70, 80, 90, or 95%, with a polypeptide a of SEQ ID NO:2; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> it has a transmembrane domain which is preferably about 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% identical to amino acid residues about 54 to 70, 77 to 93, 276 to 298, 320 to 344, 881 to 898, 905 to 925, 955 to 978, 994 to 1012, 1023 to 1039, and 1067 to 1085, of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the 67108 protein, or fragment thereof, differs from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID:2. In one embodiment it differs by at least one but by less than 15, 10 or 5 amino acid residues. In another it differs from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 by at least one residue but less than 20%, 15%, 10% or 5% of the residues in it differ from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2. (If this comparison requires alignment the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. &ldquo;Looped&rdquo; out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences.) The differences are, preferably, differences or changes at a non essential residue or a conservative substitution. In a preferred embodiment the differences are not in the E1-E2 phosphorylation site. In another preferred embodiment one or more differences are in the E1-E2 phosphorylation site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments include a protein that contains one or more changes in amino acid sequence, e.g., a change in an amino acid residue which is not essential for activity. Such 67108 proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, yet retain biological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the protein includes an amino acid sequence at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO:2. In another embodiment, the protein includes fragments or regions homologous to fragments, at least about 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous to a fragment of SEQ ID NO:2. A fragment of a 67108 protein can be a domain, e.g. a phospholipid transporter domain or a fragment thereof, e.g. about amino acid residues 4 to 85, 4 to 45, 46 to 85, 123 to 170, 123 to 145, 146 to 123, 831 to 890, 831 to 855, or 856 to 890 of SEQ ID NO:2. A fragment of a 67108 protein can have the E1-E2 phosphorylation site, i.e. a fragment can have about amino acids 392 to 398 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> A 67108 protein or fragment is provided which varies from the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 in regions defined by amino acids about 926 to 954 of SEQ ID NO:2 by at least one but by less than 15, 10 or 5 amino acid residues in the protein or fragment but which does not differ from SEQ ID NO:2 in regions defined by amino acids about 94-275 or 345-880 of SEQ ID NO:2. (If this comparison requires alignment the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. &ldquo;Looped&rdquo; out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences.) In some embodiments the difference is at a non-essential residue or is a conservative substitution, while in others the difference is at an essential residue or is a non-conservative substitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a 67108 protein can include a E1-E2 ATPase site. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the 67108 protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2. In other embodiments, the 67108 protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:2. In yet another embodiment, the 67108 protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:2 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO:2, as described in detail in the subsections above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> 67108 Chimeric or Fusion Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides 67108 chimeric or fusion proteins. As used herein, a 67108 &ldquo;chimeric protein&rdquo; or &ldquo;fusion protein&rdquo; includes a 67108 polypeptide linked to a non-67108 polypeptide. A &ldquo;non-67108 polypeptide&rdquo; refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a protein which is not substantially homologous to the 67108 protein, e.g., a protein which is different from the 67108 protein and which is derived from the same or a different organism. The 67108 polypeptide of the fusion protein can correspond to all or a portion e.g., a fragment described herein of a 67108 amino acid sequence. In a preferred embodiment, a 67108 fusion protein includes at least one (or two) biologically active portion of a 67108 protein. The non-67108 polypeptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the 67108 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The fusion protein can include a moiety which has a high affinity for a ligand. For example, the fusion protein can be a GST-67108 fusion protein in which the 67108 sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of recombinant 67108. Alternatively, the fusion protein can be a 67108 protein containing a heterologous signal sequence at its N-terminus. In certain host cells (e.g., mammalian host cells), expression and/or secretion of 67108 can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Fusion proteins can include all or a part of a serum protein, e.g., an IgG constant region, or human serum albumin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The 67108 fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject in vivo. The 67108 fusion proteins can be used to affect the bioavailability of a 67108 substrate. 67108 fusion proteins may be useful therapeutically for the treatment of disorders caused by, for example, (i) aberrant modification or mutation of a gene encoding a 67108 protein; (ii) mis-regulation of the 67108 gene; and (iii) aberrant post-translational modification of a 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the 67108-fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce anti-67108 antibodies in a subject, to purify 67108 ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of 67108 with a 67108 substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A 67108-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Variants of 67108 Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention also features a variant of a 67108 polypeptide, e.g., which functions as an agonist (mimetics) or as an antagonist. Variants of the 67108 proteins can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g., discrete point mutation, the insertion or deletion of sequences or the truncation of a 67108 protein. An agonist of the 67108 proteins can retain substantially the same, or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of a 67108 protein. An antagonist of a 67108 protein can inhibit one or more of the activities of the naturally occurring form of the 67108 protein by, for example, competitively modulating a 67108-mediated activity of a 67108 protein. Thus, specific biological effects can be elicited by treatment with a variant of limited function. Preferably, treatment of a subject with a variant having a subset of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein has fewer side effects in a subject relative to treatment with the naturally occurring form of the 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Variants of a 67108 protein can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of mutants, e.g., truncation mutants, of a 67108 protein for agonist or antagonist activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Libraries of fragments e.g., N terminal, C terminal, or internal fragments, of a 67108 protein coding sequence can be used to generate a variegated population of fragments for screening and subsequent selection of variants of a 67108 protein. Variants in which a cysteine residues is added or deleted or in which a residue which is glycosylated is added or deleted are particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Methods for screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property are known in the art. Such methods are adaptable for rapid screening of the gene libraries generated by combinatorial mutagenesis of 67108 proteins. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a new technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify 67108 variants (Arkin and Yourvan (1992) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>89:7811-7815; Delgrave et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Protein Engineering </italic></highlight>6:327-331). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Cell based assays can be exploited to analyze a variegated 67108 library. For example, a library of expression vectors can be transfected into a cell line, e.g., a cell line, which ordinarily responds to 67108 in a substrate-dependent manner. The transfected cells are then contacted with 67108 and the effect of the expression of the mutant on signaling by the 67108 substrate can be detected, e.g., by measuring ATPase activity. Plasmid DNA can then be recovered from the cells which score for inhibition, or alternatively, potentiation of signaling by the 67108 substrate, and the individual clones further characterized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of making a 67108 polypeptide, e.g., a peptide having a non-wild type activity, e.g., an antagonist, agonist, or super agonist of a naturally occurring 67108 polypeptide, e.g., a naturally occurring 67108 polypeptide. The method includes: altering the sequence of a 67108 polypeptide, e.g., altering the sequence, e.g., by substitution or deletion of one or more residues of a non-conserved region, a domain or residue disclosed herein, and testing the altered polypeptide for the desired activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of making a fragment or analog of a 67108 polypeptide a biological activity of a naturally occurring 67108 polypeptide. The method includes: altering the sequence, e.g., by substitution or deletion of one or more residues, of a 67108 polypeptide, e.g., altering the sequence of a non-conserved region, or a domain or residue described herein, and testing the altered polypeptide for the desired activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Anti-67108 Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides an anti-67108 antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., an antigen-binding fragment thereof). The term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule or immunologically active portion thereof, i.e., an antigen-binding portion. As used herein, the term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; refers to a protein comprising at least one, and preferably two, heavy (H) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VH), and at least one and preferably two light (L) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VL). The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed &ldquo;complementarity determining regions&rdquo; (&ldquo;CDR&rdquo;), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed &ldquo;framework regions&rdquo; (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDR&apos;s has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, </italic></highlight>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917, which are incorporated herein by reference). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDR&apos;s and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The anti-67108 antibody can further include a heavy and light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy and light immunoglobulin chain, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, wherein the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are inter-connected by, e.g., disulfide bonds. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;immunoglobulin&rdquo; refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. The recognized human immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA1 and IgA2), gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin &ldquo;light chains&rdquo; (about 25 KDa or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH&mdash;terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin &ldquo;heavy chains&rdquo; (about 50 KDa or 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, e.g., gamma (encoding about 330 amino acids). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antigen-binding fragment&rdquo; of an antibody (or simply &ldquo;antibody portion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;fragment&rdquo;), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to the antigen, e.g., 67108 polypeptide or fragment thereof. Examples of antigen-binding fragments of the anti-67108 antibody include, but are not limited to: (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term &ldquo;antigen-binding fragment&rdquo; of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The anti-67108 antibody can be a polyclonal or a monoclonal antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody can be recombinantly produced, e.g., produced by phage display or by combinatorial methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Phage display and combinatorial methods for generating anti-67108 antibodies are known in the art (as described in, e.g., Ladner et al.

<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the anti-67108 antibody is a fully human antibody (e.g., an antibody made in a mouse which has been genetically engineered to produce an antibody from a human immunoglobulin sequence), or a non-human antibody, e.g., a rodent (mouse or rat), goat, primate (e.g., monkey), camel antibody. Preferably, the non-human antibody is a rodent (mouse or rat antibody). Method of producing rodent antibodies are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Human monoclonal antibodies can be generated using transgenic mice carrying the human immunoglobulin genes rather than the mouse system. Splenocytes from these transgenic mice immunized with the antigen of interest are used to produce hybridomas that secrete human mAbs with specific affinities for epitopes from a human protein (see, e.g., Wood et al. International Application WO 91/00906, Kucherlapati et al. PCT publication WO 91/10741; Lonberg et al. International Application WO 92/03918; Kay et al.

<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> An anti-67108 antibody can be one in which the variable region, or a portion thereof, e.g., the CDR&apos;s, are generated in a non-human organism, e.g., a rat or mouse. Chimeric, CDR-grafted, and humanized antibodies are within the invention. Antibodies generated in a non-human organism, e.g., a rat or mouse, and then modified, e.g., in the variable framework or constant region, to decrease antigenicity in a human are within the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Chimeric antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. For example, a gene encoding the Fc constant region of a murine (or other species) monoclonal antibody molecule is digested with restriction enzymes to remove the region encoding the murine Fc, and the equivalent portion of a gene encoding a human Fc constant region is substituted (see Robinson et al., International Patent Publication PCT/US86/02269; Akira, et al., European Patent Application 184,187; Taniguchi, M., European Patent Application 171,496; Morrison et al., European Patent Application 173,494; Neuberger et al., International Application WO 86/01533; Cabilly et al.

<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> A humanized or CDR-grafted antibody will have at least one or two but generally all three recipient CDR&apos;s (of heavy and or light immuoglobulin chains) replaced with a donor CDR. The antibody may be replaced with at least a portion of a non-human CDR or only some of the CDR&apos;s may be replaced with non-human CDR&apos;s. It is only necessary to replace the number of CDR&apos;s required for binding of the humanized antibody to a 67108 or a fragment thereof. Preferably, the donor will be a rodent antibody, e.g., a rat or mouse antibody, and the recipient will be a human framework or a human consensus framework. Typically, the immunoglobulin providing the CDR&apos;s is called the &ldquo;donor&rdquo; and the immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the &ldquo;acceptor.&rdquo; In one embodiment, the donor immunoglobulin is a non-human (e.g., rodent). The acceptor framework is a naturally-occurring (e.g., a human) framework or a consensus framework, or a sequence about 85% or higher, preferably 90%, 95%, 99% or higher identical thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;consensus sequence&rdquo; refers to the sequence formed from the most frequently occurring amino acids (or nucleotides) in a family of related sequences (See e.g., Winnaker, From Genes to Clones (Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany 1987). In a family of proteins, each position in the consensus sequence is occupied by the amino acid occurring most frequently at that position in the family. If two amino acids occur equally frequently, either can be included in the consensus sequence. A &ldquo;consensus framework&rdquo; refers to the framework region in the consensus immunoglobulin sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> An antibody can be humanized by methods known in the art. Humanized antibodies can be generated by replacing sequences of the Fv variable region which are not directly involved in antigen binding with equivalent sequences from human Fv variable regions. General methods for generating humanized antibodies are provided by Morrison, S. L., 1985<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>229:1202-1207, by Oi et al., 1986<highlight><italic>, Bio Techniques </italic></highlight>4:214, and by Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762, the contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Those methods include isolating, manipulating, and expressing the nucleic acid sequences that encode all or part of immunoglobulin Fv variable regions from at least one of a heavy or light chain. Sources of such nucleic acid are well known to those skilled in the art and, for example, may be obtained from a hybridoma producing an antibody against a 67108 polypeptide or fragment thereof. The recombinant DNA encoding the humanized antibody, or fragment thereof, can then be cloned into an appropriate expression vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Humanized or CDR-grafted antibodies can be produced by CDR-grafting or CDR substitution, wherein one, two, or all CDR&apos;s of an immunoglobulin chain can be replaced. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539; Jones et al. 1986 <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>321:552-525; Verhoeyan et al. 1988 <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>239:1534; Beidler et al. 1988 <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>141:4053-4060; Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539, the contents of all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Winter describes a CDR-grafting method which may be used to prepare the humanized antibodies of the present invention (UK Patent Application GB 2188638A, filed on Mar. 26, 1987; Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539), the contents of which is expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Also within the scope of the invention are humanized antibodies in which specific amino acids have been substituted, deleted or added. Preferred humanized antibodies have amino acid substitutions in the framework region, such as to improve binding to the antigen. For example, a humanized antibody will have framework residues identical to the donor framework residue or to another amino acid other than the recipient framework residue. To generate such antibodies, a selected, small number of acceptor framework residues of the humanized immunoglobulin chain can be replaced by the corresponding donor amino acids. Preferred locations of the substitutions include amino acid residues adjacent to the CDR, or which are capable of interacting with a CDR (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089). Criteria for selecting amino acids from the donor are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, e.g., columns 12-16 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, the e.g., columns 12-16 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other techniques for humanizing antibodies are described in Padlan et al. EP 519596 A1, published on Dec. 23, 1992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, an antibody can be made by immunizing with purified 67108 antigen, or a fragment thereof, e.g., a fragment described herein, membrane associated antigen, tissue, e.g., crude tissue preparations, whole cells, preferably living cells, lysed cells, or cell fractions, e.g., membrane fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> A full-length 67108 protein or, antigenic peptide fragment of 67108 can be used as an immunogen or can be used to identify anti-67108 antibodies made with other immunogens, e.g., cells, membrane preparations, and the like. The antigenic peptide of 67108 should include at least 8 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and encompasses an epitope of 67108. Preferably, the antigenic peptide includes at least 10 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 15 amino acid residues, even more preferably at least 20 amino acid residues, and most preferably at least 30 amino acid residues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Fragments of 67108 which include residues about 91 to 111, from about 151 to 165, and from about 1095 to 1128 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make, e.g., used as immunogens or used to characterize the specificity of an antibody, antibodies against hydrophilic regions of the 67108 protein(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Similarly, fragments of 67108 which include residues about 58 to 85, from about 271 to 291, and from about 992 to 1010 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make an antibody against a hydrophobic region of the 67108 protein; fragments of 67108 which include residues about 71 to 76, about 299 to 319, about 899 to 904, 979 to 993 or 1040 to 1066 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make an antibody against an extracellular region of the 67108 protein; fragments of 67108 which include residues about 1-53, 94-275, 345-880, 926-954, 1013-1022 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make an antibody against an intracellular region of the 67108 protein; a fragment of 67108 which include residues about 392 to 398 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make an antibody against the E1-E2 ATPase site of the 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Antibodies reactive with, or specific for, any of these epitope bearing regions, or other regions or domains described herein are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Antibodies which bind only native 67108 protein, only denatured or otherwise non-native 67108 protein, or which bind both, are with in the invention. Antibodies with linear or conformational epitopes are within the invention. Conformational epitopes can sometimes be identified by identifying antibodies which bind to native but not denatured 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Preferred epitopes encompassed by the antigenic peptide are regions of 67108 are located on the surface of the protein, e.g., hydrophilic regions, as well as regions with high antigenicity. For example, an Emini surface probability analysis of the human 67108 protein sequence can be used to indicate the regions that have a particularly high probability of being localized to the surface of the 67108 protein and are thus likely to constitute surface residues useful for targeting antibody production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the antibody can bind to the extracellular portion of the 67108 protein, e.g., it can bind to a whole cell which expresses the 67108 protein. In another embodiment, the antibody binds an intracellular portion of the 67108 protein. In preferred embodiments antibodies can bind one or more of purified antigen, membrane associated antigen, tissue, e.g., tissue sections, whole cells, preferably living cells, lysed cells, cell fractions, e.g., membrane fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The anti-67108 antibody can be a single chain antibody. A single-chain antibody (scFV) may be engineered (see, for example, Colcher, D. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Ann N Y Acad Sci </italic></highlight>880:263-80; and Reiter, Y. (1996) <highlight><italic>Clin Cancer Res </italic></highlight>2:245-52). The single chain antibody can be dimerized or multimerized to generate multivalent antibodies having specificities for different epitopes of the same target 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the antibody has effector function and/or can fix complement. In other embodiments, the antibody does not recruit effector cells; or does not fix complement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the antibody has reduced or no ability to bind an Fc receptor. For example, it is an isotype or subtype, fragment or other mutant, which does not support binding to an Fc receptor, e.g., it has a mutagenized or deleted Fc receptor binding region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, an anti-67108 antibody alters (e.g., increases or decreases) the ATPase activity of a 67108 polypeptide. For example, the antibody can bind at or in proximity to the active site, e.g., to an epitope that includes a residue located from about 392 to 398 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> An antibody (or fragment thereof) may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, a therapeutic agent, a radioactive ion, a radioactive nucleus, or an imaging agent, e.g. a radioactive, enzymatic, or other, e.g., imaging agent, e.g., a NMR contrast agent. Labels which produce detectable radioactive emissions or fluorescence are preferred. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include ricin or diphtheria toxin or active fragment thereof, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, puromycin, maytansinoids, e.g., maytansinol (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), CC-1065 (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092, 5,585,499, 5,846,545) and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, CC-1065, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, taxol and maytansinoids). Radioactive ions include, but are not limited to iodine, yttrium and praseodymium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the therapeutic moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, &agr;-interferon, &bgr;-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (&ldquo;IL-1&rdquo;), interleukin-2 (&ldquo;IL-2&rdquo;), interleukin-6 (&ldquo;IL-6&rdquo;), granulocyte macrophase colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;GM-CSF&rdquo;), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;G-CSF&rdquo;), or other growth factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> An anti-67108 antibody (e.g., monoclonal antibody) can be used to isolate 67108 by standard techniques, such as affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation. Moreover, an anti-67108 antibody can be used to detect 67108 protein (e.g., in a cellular lysate or cell supernatant) in order to evaluate the abundance and pattern of expression of the protein. Anti-67108 antibodies can be used diagnostically to monitor protein levels in tissue as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling (i.e., physically linking) the antibody to a detectable substance (i.e., antibody labelling). Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, &bgr;-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a nucleic acid which encodes an anti-67108 antibody, e.g., an anti-67108 antibody described herein. Also included are vectors which include the nucleic acid and cells transformed with the nucleic acid, particularly cells which are useful for producing an antibody, e.g., mammalian cells, e.g. CHO or lymphatic cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes cell lines, e.g., hybridomas, which make an anti-67108 antibody, e.g., and antibody described herein, and method of using said cells to make a 67108 antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Recombinant Expression Vectors, Host Cells and Genetically Engineered Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention includes, vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide described herein. As used herein, the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked and can include a plasmid, cosmid or viral vector. The vector can be capable of autonomous replication or it can integrate into a host DNA. Viral vectors include, e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> A vector can include a 67108 nucleic acid in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. Preferably the recombinant expression vector includes one or more regulatory sequences operatively linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. The term &ldquo;regulatory sequence&rdquo; includes promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence, as well as tissue-specific regulatory and/or inducible sequences. The design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the like. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or polypeptides, including fusion proteins or polypeptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., 67108 proteins, mutant forms of 67108 proteins, fusion proteins, and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be designed for expression of 67108 proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, polypeptides of the invention can be expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>insect cells (e.g., using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, (1990) <highlight><italic>Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S. (1988) <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>67:31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Purified fusion proteins can be used in 67108 activity assays, (e.g., direct assays or competitive assays described in detail below), or to generate antibodies specific for 67108 proteins. In a preferred embodiment, a fusion protein expressed in a retroviral expression vector of the present invention can be used to infect bone marrow cells which are subsequently transplanted into irradiated recipients. The pathology of the subject recipient is then examined after sufficient time has passed (e.g., six weeks). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> To maximize recombinant protein expression in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>is to express the protein in a host bacteria with an impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the recombinant protein (Gottesman, S., (1990) <highlight><italic>Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. 119-128). Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vector so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(Wada et al., (1992) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>20:2111-2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried out by standard DNA synthesis techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The 67108 expression vector can be a yeast expression vector, a vector for expression in insect cells, e.g., a baculovirus expression vector or a vector suitable for expression in mammalian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector&apos;s control functions can be provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the promoter is an inducible promoter, e.g., a promoter regulated by a steroid hormone, by a polypeptide hormone (e.g., by means of a signal transduction pathway), or by a heterologous polypeptide (e.g., the tetracycline-inducible systems, &ldquo;Tet-On&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tet-Off&rdquo;; see, e.g., Clontech Inc., CA, Gossen and Bujard (1992) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>89:5547, and Paillard (1989) <highlight><italic>Human Gene Therapy </italic></highlight>9:983). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>1:268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) <highlight><italic>Adv. Immunol. </italic></highlight>43:235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore (1989) <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore (1983) Cell 33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Ruddle (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>230:912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Patent No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example, the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss (1990) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>249:374-379) and the &agr;-fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman (1989) <highlight><italic>Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>3:537-546). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA molecule of the invention cloned into the expression vector in an antisense orientation. Regulatory sequences (e.g., viral promoters and/or enhancers) operatively linked to a nucleic acid cloned in the antisense orientation can be chosen which direct the constitutive, tissue specific or cell type specific expression of antisense RNA in a variety of cell types. The antisense expression vector can be in the form of a recombinant plasmid, phagemid or attenuated virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Another aspect the invention provides a host cell which includes a nucleic acid molecule described herein, e.g., a 67108 nucleic acid molecule within a recombinant expression vector or a 67108 nucleic acid molecule containing sequences which allow it to homologously recombine into a specific site of the host cell&apos;s genome. The terms &ldquo;host cell&rdquo; and &ldquo;recombinant host cell&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein. Such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, a 67108 protein can be expressed in bacterial cells (such as <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>), insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells (African green monkey kidney cells CV-1 origin SV40 cells; Gluzman (1981) <highlight><italic>Cell</italic></highlight>123:175-182)). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Vector DNA can be introduced into host cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; and &ldquo;transfection&rdquo; are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> A host cell of the invention can be used to produce (i.e., express) a 67108 protein. Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing a 67108 protein using the host cells of the invention. In one embodiment, the method includes culturing the host cell of the invention (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding a 67108 protein has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that a 67108 protein is produced. In another embodiment, the method further includes isolating a 67108 protein from the medium or the host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a cell or purified preparation of cells which include a 67108 transgene, or which otherwise misexpress 67108. The cell preparation can consist of human or non-human cells, e.g., rodent cells, e.g., mouse or rat cells, rabbit cells, or pig cells. In preferred embodiments, the cell or cells include a 67108 transgene, e.g., a heterologous form of a 67108, e.g., a gene derived from humans (in the case of a non-human cell). The 67108 transgene can be misexpressed, e.g., overexpressed or underexpressed. In other preferred embodiments, the cell or cells include a gene that mis-expresses an endogenous 67108, e.g., a gene the expression of which is disrupted, e.g., a knockout. Such cells can serve as a model for studying disorders that are related to mutated or mis-expressed 67108 alleles or for use in drug screening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a human cell, e.g., a hematopoietic stem cell, transformed with nucleic acid which encodes a subject 67108 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Also provided are cells, preferably human cells, e.g., human hematopoietic or fibroblast cells, in which an endogenous 67108 is under the control of a regulatory sequence that does not normally control the expression of the endogenous 67108 gene. The expression characteristics of an endogenous gene within a cell, e.g., a cell line or microorganism, can be modified by inserting a heterologous DNA regulatory element into the genome of the cell such that the inserted regulatory element is operably linked to the endogenous 67108 gene. For example, an endogenous 67108 gene which is &ldquo;transcriptionally silent,&rdquo; e.g., not normally expressed, or expressed only at very low levels, may be activated by inserting a regulatory element which is capable of promoting the expression of a normally expressed gene product in that cell. Techniques such as targeted homologous recombinations, can be used to insert the heterologous DNA as described in, e.g., Chappel, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,071; WO 91/06667, published in May 16, 1991. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, recombinant cells described herein can be used for replacement therapy in a subject. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a 67108 polypeptide operably linked to an inducible promoter (e.g., a steroid hormone receptor-regulated promoter) is introduced into a human or nonhuman, e.g., mammalian, e.g., porcine recombinant cell. The cell is cultivated and encapsulated in a biocompatible material, such as poly-lysine alginate, and subsequently implanted into the subject. See, e.g., Lanza (1996) <highlight><italic>Nat. Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>14:1107; Joki et al. (2001) <highlight><italic>Nat. Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>19:35; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,742. Production of 67108 polypeptide can be regulated in the subject by administering an agent (e.g., a steroid hormone) to the subject. In another preferred embodiment, the implanted recombinant cells express and secrete an antibody specific for a 67108 polypeptide. The antibody can be any antibody or any antibody derivative described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Transgenic Animals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The invention provides non-human transgenic animals. Such animals are useful for studying the function and/or activity of a 67108 protein and for identifying and/or evaluating modulators of 67108 activity. As used herein, a &ldquo;transgenic animal&rdquo; is a non-human animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a rodent such as a rat or mouse, in which one or more of the cells of the animal includes a transgene. Other examples of transgenic animals include non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cows, goats, chickens, amphibians, and the like. A transgene is exogenous DNA or a rearrangement, e.g., a deletion of endogenous chromosomal DNA, which preferably is integrated into or occurs in the genome of the cells of a transgenic animal. A transgene can direct the expression of an encoded gene product in one or more cell types or tissues of the transgenic animal, other transgenes, e.g., a knockout, reduce expression. Thus, a transgenic animal can be one in which an endogenous 67108 gene has been altered by, e.g., by homologous recombination between the endogenous gene and an exogenous DNA molecule introduced into a cell of the animal, e.g., an embryonic cell of the animal, prior to development of the animal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Intronic sequences and polyadenylation signals can also be included in the transgene to increase the efficiency of expression of the transgene. A tissue-specific regulatory sequence(s) can be operably linked to a transgene of the invention to direct expression of a 67108 protein to particular cells. A transgenic founder animal can be identified based upon the presence of a 67108 transgene in its genome and/or expression of 67108 mRNA in tissues or cells of the animals. A transgenic founder animal can then be used to breed additional animals carrying the transgene. Moreover, transgenic animals carrying a transgene encoding a 67108 protein can further be bred to other transgenic animals carrying other transgenes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> 67108 proteins or polypeptides can be expressed in transgenic animals or plants, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding the protein or polypeptide can be introduced into the genome of an animal. In preferred embodiments the nucleic acid is placed under the control of a tissue specific promoter, e.g., a milk or egg specific promoter, and recovered from the milk or eggs produced by the animal. Suitable animals are mice, pigs, cows, goats, and sheep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a population of cells from a transgenic animal, as discussed, e.g., below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Uses </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules, proteins, protein homologues, and antibodies described herein can be used in one or more of the following methods: a) screening assays; b) predictive medicine (e.g., diagnostic assays, prognostic assays, monitoring clinical trials, and pharmacogenetics); and c) methods of treatment (e.g., therapeutic and prophylactic). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The isolated nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be used, for example, to express a 67108 protein (e.g., via a recombinant expression vector in a host cell in gene therapy applications), to detect a 67108 mRNA (e.g., in a biological sample) or a genetic alteration in a 67108 gene, and to modulate 67108 activity, as described further below. The 67108 proteins can be used to treat disorders characterized by insufficient or excessive production of a 67108 substrate or production of 67108 inhibitors. In addition, the 67108 proteins can be used to screen for naturally occurring 67108 substrates, to screen for drugs or compounds which modulate 67108 activity, as well as to treat disorders characterized by insufficient or excessive production of 67108 protein or production of 67108 protein forms which have decreased, aberrant or unwanted activity compared to 67108 wild type protein (e.g., a phospholipid transporter-associated disorder). Moreover, the anti-67108 antibodies of the invention can be used to detect and isolate 67108 proteins, regulate the bioavailability of 67108 proteins, and modulate 67108 activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> A method of evaluating a compound for the ability to interact with, e.g., bind, a subject 67108 polypeptide is provided. The method includes: contacting the compound with the subject 67108 polypeptide; and evaluating ability of the compound to interact with, e.g., to bind or form a complex with the subject 67108 polypeptide. This method can be performed in vitro, e.g., in a cell free system, or in vivo, e.g., in a two-hybrid interaction trap assay. This method can be used to identify naturally occurring molecules that interact with subject 67108 polypeptide. It can also be used to find natural or synthetic inhibitors of subject 67108 polypeptide. Screening methods are discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Screening Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The invention provides methods (also referred to herein as &ldquo;screening assays&rdquo;) for identifying modulators, i.e., candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids, small molecules or other drugs) which bind to 67108 proteins, have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on, for example, 67108 expression or 67108 activity, or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on, for example, the expression or activity of a 67108 substrate. Compounds thus identified can be used to modulate the activity of target gene products (e.g., 67108 genes) in a therapeutic protocol, to elaborate the biological function of the target gene product, or to identify compounds that disrupt normal target gene interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which are substrates of a 67108 protein or polypeptide or a biologically active portion thereof. In another embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds that bind to or modulate an activity of a 67108 protein or polypeptide or a biologically active portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The test compounds of the present invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; peptoid libraries (libraries of molecules having the functionalities of peptides, but with a novel, non-peptide backbone which are resistant to enzymatic degradation but which nevertheless remain bioactive; see, e.g., Zuckermann, R. N. et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>37:2678-85); spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the &lsquo;one-bead one-compound&rsquo; library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library and peptoid library approaches are limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam (1997) <highlight><italic>Anticancer Drug Des. </italic></highlight>12:145). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: DeWitt et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>90:6909; Erb et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>91:11422; Zuckermann et al.

Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>37:1233. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Libraries of compounds may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992) <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>13:412-421), or on beads (Lam (1991) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>354:82-84), chips (Fodor (1993) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>364:555-556), bacteria (Ladner, U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), spores (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), plasmids (Cull et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </italic></highlight>89:1865-1869) or on phage (Scott and Smith (1990) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>249:386-390; Devlin (1990) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>249:404-406; Cwirla et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>87:6378-6382; Felici (1991) <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>222:301-310; Ladner supra.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an assay is a cell-based assay in which a cell which expresses a 67108 protein or biologically active portion thereof is contacted with a test compound, and the ability of the test compound to modulate 67108 activity is determined. Determining the ability of the test compound to modulate 67108 activity can be accomplished by monitoring, for example, the ability of a 67108 polypeptide to reside within a membrane, hydrolyze ATP or transport a phospholipid. The cell, for example, can be of mammalian origin, e.g., human. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The ability of the test compound to modulate 67108 binding to a compound, e.g., a 67108 substrate, or to bind to 67108 can also be evaluated. This can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the compound, e.g., the substrate, with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the compound, e.g., the substrate, to 67108 can be determined by detecting the labeled compound, e.g., substrate, in a complex. Alternatively, 67108 could be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label to monitor the ability of a test compound to modulate 67108 binding to a 67108 substrate in a complex. For example, compounds (e.g., 67108 substrates) can be labeled with <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S, <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C, or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, compounds can be enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The ability of a compound (e.g., a 67108 substrate) to interact with 67108 with or without the labeling of any of the interactants can be evaluated. For example, a microphysiometer can be used to detect the interaction of a compound with 67108 without the labeling of either the compound or the 67108. McConnell, H. M. et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>257:1906-1912. As used herein, a &ldquo;microphysiometer&rdquo; (e.g., Cytosensor) is an analytical instrument that measures the rate at which a cell acidifies its environment using a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). Changes in this acidification rate can be used as an indicator of the interaction between a compound and 67108. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a cell-free assay is provided in which a 67108 protein or biologically active portion thereof is contacted with a test compound and the ability of the test compound to bind to the 67108 protein or biologically active portion thereof is evaluated. Preferred biologically active portions of the 67108 proteins to be used in assays of the present invention include fragments which participate in interactions with non-67108 molecules, e.g., fragments with high surface probability scores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Soluble and/or membrane-bound forms of isolated proteins (e.g., 67108 proteins or biologically active portions thereof) can be used in the cell-free assays of the invention. When membrane-bound forms of the protein are used, it may be desirable to utilize a solubilizing agent. Examples of such solubilizing agents include non-ionic detergents such as n-octylglucoside, n-dodecylglucoside, n-dodecylmaltoside, octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, Triton&reg; X-100, Triton&reg; X-114, Thesit&reg;, Isotridecypoly(ethylene glycol ether)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, 3-&lsqb;(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio&rsqb;-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), 3-&lsqb;(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio&rsqb;-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO), or N-dodecyl&equals;N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Cell-free assays involve preparing a reaction mixture of the target gene protein and the test compound under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two components to interact and bind, thus forming a complex that can be removed and/or detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> The interaction between two molecules can also be detected, e.g., using fluorescence energy transfer (FET) (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first, &lsquo;donor&rsquo; molecule is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second, &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule, which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed energy. Alternately, the &lsquo;donor&rsquo; protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light, such that the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label may be differentiated from that of the &lsquo;donor&rsquo;. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art (e.g., using a fluorimeter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, determining the ability of the 67108 protein to bind to a target molecule can be accomplished using real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) (see, e.g., Sjolander, S. and Urbaniczky, C. (1991) <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>63:2338-2345 and Szabo et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. </italic></highlight>5:699-705). &ldquo;Surface plasmon resonance&rdquo; or &ldquo;BIA&rdquo; detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BIAcore). Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)), resulting in a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the target gene product or the test substance is anchored onto a solid phase. The target gene product/test compound complexes anchored on the solid phase can be detected at the end of the reaction. Preferably, the target gene product can be anchored onto a solid surface, and the test compound, (which is not anchored), can be labeled, either directly or indirectly, with detectable labels discussed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to immobilize either 67108, an anti-67108 antibody or its target molecule to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the proteins, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a test compound to a 67108 protein, or interaction of a 67108 protein with a target molecule in the presence and absence of a candidate compound, can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Examples of such vessels include microtiter plates, test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix. For example, glutathione-S-transferase/67108 fusion proteins or glutathione-S-transferase/target fusion proteins can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) or glutathione derivatized microtiter plates, which are then combined with the test compound or the test compound and either the non-adsorbed target protein or 67108 protein, and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation (e.g., at physiological conditions for salt and pH). Following incubation, the beads or microtiter plate wells are washed to remove any unbound components, the matrix immobilized in the case of beads, complex determined either directly or indirectly, for example, as described above. Alternatively, the complexes can be dissociated from the matrix, and the level of 67108 binding or activity determined using standard techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Other techniques for immobilizing either a 67108 protein or a target molecule on matrices include using conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated 67108 protein or target molecules can be prepared from biotin-NHS (N-hydroxy-succinimide) using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce Chemical). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In order to conduct the assay, the non-immobilized component is added to the coated surface containing the anchored component. After the reaction is complete, unreacted components are removed (e.g., by washing) under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the previously non-immobilized component is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the previously non-immobilized component is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the immobilized component (the antibody, in turn, can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with, e.g., a labeled anti-Ig antibody). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, this assay is performed utilizing antibodies reactive with 67108 protein or target molecules but which do not interfere with binding of the 67108 protein to its target molecule. Such antibodies can be derivatized to the wells of the plate, and unbound target or 67108 protein trapped in the wells by antibody conjugation. Methods for detecting such complexes, in addition to those described above for the GST-immobilized complexes, include immunodetection of complexes using antibodies reactive with the 67108 protein or target molecule, as well as enzyme-linked assays which rely on detecting an enzymatic activity associated with the 67108 protein or target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, cell free assays can be conducted in a liquid phase. In such an assay, the reaction products are separated from unreacted components, by any of a number of standard techniques, including but not limited to: differential centrifugation (see, for example, Rivas, G., and Minton, A. P., (1993) <highlight><italic>Trends Biochem Sci </italic></highlight>18:284-7); chromatography (gel filtration chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography); electrophoresis (see, e.g., Ausubel, F. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 1999, J. Wiley: New York.); and immunoprecipitation (see, for example, Ausubel, F. et al., eds. (1999) <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, J. Wiley: New York). Such resins and chromatographic techniques are known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Heegaard, N. H., (</italic></highlight>1998) <highlight><italic>J Mol Recognit </italic></highlight>11: 141-8; Hage, D. S., and Tweed, S. A. (1997) <highlight><italic>J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl. </italic></highlight>699:499-525). Further, fluorescence energy transfer may also be conveniently utilized, as described herein, to detect binding without further purification of the complex from solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the assay includes contacting the 67108 protein or biologically active portion thereof with a known compound which binds 67108 to form an assay mixture, contacting the assay mixture with a test compound, and determining the ability of the test compound to interact with a 67108 protein, wherein determining the ability of the test compound to interact with a 67108 protein includes determining the ability of the test compound to preferentially bind to 67108 or biologically active portion thereof, or to modulate the activity of a target molecule, as compared to the known compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> The target gene products of the invention can, in vivo, interact with one or more cellular or extracellular macromolecules, such as proteins. For the purposes of this discussion, such cellular and extracellular macromolecules are referred to herein as &ldquo;binding partners.&rdquo; Compounds that disrupt such interactions can be useful in regulating the activity of the target gene product. Such compounds can include, but are not limited to molecules such as antibodies, peptides, and small molecules. The preferred target genes/products for use in this embodiment are the 67108 genes herein identified. In an alternative embodiment, the invention provides methods for determining the ability of the test compound to modulate the activity of a 67108 protein through modulation of the activity of a downstream effector of a 67108 target molecule. For example, the activity of the effector molecule on an appropriate target can be determined, or the binding of the effector to an appropriate target can be determined, as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> To identify compounds that interfere with the interaction between the target gene product and its cellular or extracellular binding partner(s), a reaction mixture containing the target gene product and the binding partner is prepared, under conditions and for a time sufficient, to allow the two products to form complex. In order to test an inhibitory agent, the reaction mixture is provided in the presence and absence of the test compound. The test compound can be initially included in the reaction mixture, or can be added at a time subsequent to the addition of the target gene and its cellular or extracellular binding partner. Control reaction mixtures are incubated without the test compound or with a placebo. The formation of any complexes between the target gene product and the cellular or extracellular binding partner is then detected. The formation of a complex in the control reaction, but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound, indicates that the compound interferes with the interaction of the target gene product and the interactive binding partner. Additionally, complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and normal target gene product can also be compared to complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and mutant target gene product. This comparison can be important in those cases wherein it is desirable to identify compounds that disrupt interactions of mutant but not normal target gene products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> These assays can be conducted in a heterogeneous or homogeneous format. Heterogeneous assays involve anchoring either the target gene product or the binding partner onto a solid phase, and detecting complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In homogeneous assays, the entire reaction is carried out in a liquid phase. In either approach, the order of addition of reactants can be varied to obtain different information about the compounds being tested. For example, test compounds that interfere with the interaction between the target gene products and the binding partners, e.g., by competition, can be identified by conducting the reaction in the presence of the test substance. Alternatively, test compounds that disrupt preformed complexes, e.g., compounds with higher binding constants that displace one of the components from the complex, can be tested by adding the test compound to the reaction mixture after complexes have been formed. The various formats are briefly described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In a heterogeneous assay system, either the target gene product or the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner, is anchored onto a solid surface (e.g., a microtiter plate), while the non-anchored species is labeled, either directly or indirectly. The anchored species can be immobilized by non-covalent or covalent attachments. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody specific for the species to be anchored can be used to anchor the species to the solid surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In order to conduct the assay, the partner of the immobilized species is exposed to the coated surface with or without the test compound. After the reaction is complete, unreacted components are removed (e.g., by washing) and any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. Where the non-immobilized species is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the non-immobilized species is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the initially non-immobilized species (the antibody, in turn, can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with, e.g., a labeled anti-Ig antibody). Depending upon the order of addition of reaction components, test compounds that inhibit complex formation or that disrupt preformed complexes can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase in the presence or absence of the test compound, the reaction products separated from unreacted components, and complexes detected; e.g., using an immobilized antibody specific for one of the binding components to anchor any complexes formed in solution, and a labeled antibody specific for the other partner to detect anchored complexes. Again, depending upon the order of addition of reactants to the liquid phase, test compounds that inhibit complex or that disrupt preformed complexes can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, a homogeneous assay can be used. For example, a preformed complex of the target gene product and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product is prepared in that either the target gene products or their binding partners are labeled, but the signal generated by the label is quenched due to complex formation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,496 that utilizes this approach for immunoassays). The addition of a test substance that competes with and displaces one of the species from the preformed complex will result in the generation of a signal above background. In this way, test substances that disrupt target gene product-binding partner interaction can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the 67108 proteins can be used as &ldquo;bait proteins&rdquo; in a two-hybrid assay or three-hybrid assay (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,317; Zervos et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>72:223-232; Madura et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>268:12046-12054; Bartel et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>14:920-924; Iwabuchi et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Oncogene </italic></highlight>8:1693-1696; and Brent WO94/10300), to identify other proteins, which bind to or interact with 67108 (&ldquo;67108-binding proteins&rdquo; or &ldquo;67108-bp&rdquo;) and are involved in 67108 activity. Such 67108-bps can be activators or inhibitors of signals by the 67108 proteins or 67108 targets as, for example, downstream elements of a 67108-mediated signaling pathway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> The two-hybrid system is based on the modular nature of most transcription factors, which consist of separable DNA-binding and activation domains. Briefly, the assay utilizes two different DNA constructs. In one construct, the gene that codes for a 67108 protein is fused to a gene encoding the DNA binding domain of a known transcription factor (e.g., GAL-4). In the other construct, a DNA sequence, from a library of DNA sequences, that encodes an unidentified protein (&ldquo;prey&rdquo; or &ldquo;sample&rdquo;) is fused to a gene that codes for the activation domain of the known transcription factor. (Alternatively the: 67108 protein can be the fused to the activator domain.) If the &ldquo;bait&rdquo; and the &ldquo;prey&rdquo; proteins are able to interact, in vivo, forming a 67108-dependent complex, the DNA-binding and activation domains of the transcription factor are brought into close proximity. This proximity allows transcription of a reporter gene (e.g., lacZ) which is operably linked to a transcriptional regulatory site responsive to the transcription factor. Expression of the reporter gene can be detected and cell colonies containing the functional transcription factor can be isolated and used to obtain the cloned gene which encodes the protein which interacts with the 67108 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, modulators of 67108 expression are identified. For example, a cell or cell free mixture is contacted with a candidate compound and the expression of 67108 mRNA or protein evaluated relative to the level of expression of 67108 mRNA or protein in the absence of the candidate compound. When expression of 67108 mRNA or protein is greater in the presence of the candidate compound than in its absence, the candidate compound is identified as a stimulator of 67108 mRNA or protein expression. Alternatively, when expression of 67108 mRNA or protein is less (statistically significantly less) in the presence of the candidate compound than in its absence, the candidate compound is identified as an inhibitor of 67108 mRNA or protein expression. The level of 67108 mRNA or protein expression can be determined by methods described herein for detecting 67108 mRNA or protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention pertains to a combination of two or more of the assays described herein. For example, a modulating agent can be identified using a cell-based or a cell free assay, and the ability of the agent to modulate the activity of a 67108 protein can be confirmed in vivo, e.g., in an animal such as an animal model for a phospholipid associated disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> This invention further pertains to novel agents identified by the above-described screening assays. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use an agent identified as described herein (e.g., a 67108 modulating agent, an antisense 67108 nucleic acid molecule, a 67108-specific antibody, or a 67108-binding partner) in an appropriate animal model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, side effects, or mechanism of action, of treatment with such an agent. Furthermore, novel agents identified by the above-described screening assays can be used for treatments as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Detection Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Portions or fragments of the nucleic acid sequences identified herein can be used as polynucleotide reagents. For example, these sequences can be used to: (i) map their respective genes on a chromosome e.g., to locate gene regions associated with genetic disease or to associate 67108 with a disease; (ii) identify an individual from a minute biological sample (tissue typing); and (iii) aid in forensic identification of a biological sample. These applications are described in the subsections below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Chromosome Mapping </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> The 67108 nucleotide sequences or portions thereof can be used to map the location of the 67108 genes on a chromosome. This process is called chromosome mapping. Chromosome mapping is useful in correlating the 67108 sequences with genes associated with disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Briefly, 67108 genes can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably 15-25 bp in length) from the 67108 nucleotide sequences. These primers can then be used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the 67108 sequences will yield an amplified fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> A panel of somatic cell hybrids in which each cell line contains either a single human chromosome or a small number of human chromosomes, and a full set of mouse chromosomes, can allow easy mapping of individual genes to specific human chromosomes. (D&apos;Eustachio P. et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>220:919-924). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Other mapping strategies e.g., in situ hybridization (described in Fan, Y. et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>87:6223-27), pre-screening with labeled flow-sorted chromosomes, and pre-selection by hybridization to chromosome specific cDNA libraries can be used to map 67108 to a chromosomal location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a DNA sequence to a metaphase chromosomal spread can further be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. The FISH technique can be used with a DNA sequence as short as 500 or 600 bases. However, clones larger than 1,000 bases have a higher likelihood of binding to a unique chromosomal location with sufficient signal intensity for simple detection. Preferably 1,000 bases, and more preferably 2,000 bases will suffice to get good results at a reasonable amount of time. For a review of this technique, see Verma et al., Human Chromosomes: A Manual of Basic Techniques ((1988) Pergamon Press, New York). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Reagents for chromosome mapping can be used individually to mark a single chromosome or a single site on that chromosome, or panels of reagents can be used for marking multiple sites and/or multiple chromosomes. Reagents corresponding to noncoding regions of the genes actually are preferred for mapping purposes. Coding sequences are more likely to be conserved within gene families, thus increasing the chance of cross hybridizations during chromosomal mapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. (Such data are found, for example, in V. McKusick, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, available on-line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library). The relationship between a gene and a disease, mapped to the same chromosomal region, can then be identified through linkage analysis (co-inheritance of physically adjacent genes), described in, for example, Egeland, J. et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>325:783-787. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Moreover, differences in the DNA sequences between individuals affected and unaffected with a disease associated with the 67108 gene, can be determined. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any unaffected individuals, then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the particular disease. Comparison of affected and unaffected individuals generally involves first looking for structural alterations in the chromosomes, such as deletions or translocations that are visible from chromosome spreads or detectable using PCR based on that DNA sequence. Ultimately, complete sequencing of genes from several individuals can be performed to confirm the presence of a mutation and to distinguish mutations from polymorphisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Tissue Typing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> 67108 sequences can be used to identify individuals from biological samples using, e.g., restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). In this technique, an individual&apos;s genomic DNA is digested with one or more restriction enzymes, the fragments separated, e.g., in a Southern blot, and probed to yield bands for identification. The sequences of the present invention are useful as additional DNA markers for RFLP (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,057). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the sequences of the present invention can also be used to determine the actual base-by-base DNA sequence of selected portions of an individual&apos;s genome. Thus, the 67108 nucleotide sequences described herein can be used to prepare two PCR primers from the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of the sequences. These primers can then be used to amplify an individual&apos;s DNA and subsequently sequence it. Panels of corresponding DNA sequences from individuals, prepared in this manner, can provide unique individual identifications, as each individual will have a unique set of such DNA sequences due to allelic differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Allelic variation occurs to some degree in the coding regions of these sequences, and to a greater degree in the noncoding regions. Each of the sequences described herein can, to some degree, be used as a standard against which DNA from an individual can be compared for identification purposes. Because greater numbers of polymorphisms occur in the noncoding regions, fewer sequences are necessary to differentiate individuals. The noncoding sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 can provide positive individual identification with a panel of perhaps 10 to 1,000 primers which each yield a noncoding amplified sequence of 100 bases. If predicted coding sequences, such as those in SEQ ID NO:3 are used, a more appropriate number of primers for positive individual identification would be 500-2,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> If a panel of reagents from 67108 nucleotide sequences described herein is used to generate a unique identification database for an individual, those same reagents can later be used to identify tissue from that individual. Using the unique identification database, positive identification of the individual, living or dead, can be made from extremely small tissue samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Use of Partial 67108 Sequences in Forensic Biology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> DNA-based identification techniques can also be used in forensic biology. To make such an identification, PCR technology can be used to amplify DNA sequences taken from very small biological samples such as tissues, e.g., hair or skin, or body fluids, e.g., blood, saliva, or semen found at a crime scene. The amplified sequence can then be compared to a standard, thereby allowing identification of the origin of the biological sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> The sequences of the present invention can be used to provide polynucleotide reagents, e.g., PCR primers, targeted to specific loci in the human genome, which can enhance the reliability of DNA-based forensic identifications by, for example, providing another &ldquo;identification marker&rdquo; (i.e. another DNA sequence that is unique to a particular individual). As mentioned above, actual base sequence information can be used for identification as an accurate alternative to patterns formed by restriction enzyme generated fragments. Sequences targeted to noncoding regions of SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g., fragments derived from the noncoding regions of SEQ ID NO:1 having a length of at least 20 bases, preferably at least 30 bases) are particularly appropriate for this use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> The 67108 nucleotide sequences described herein can further be used to provide polynucleotide reagents, e.g., labeled or labelable probes which can be used in, for example, an in situ hybridization technique, to identify a specific tissue. This can be very useful in cases where a forensic pathologist is presented with a tissue of unknown origin. Panels of such 67108 probes can be used to identify tissue by species and/or by organ type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In a similar fashion, these reagents, e.g., 67108 primers or probes can be used to screen tissue culture for contamination (i.e. screen for the presence of a mixture of different types of cells in a culture). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Predictive Medicine </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> The present invention also pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which diagnostic assays, prognostic assays, and monitoring clinical trials are used for prognostic (predictive) purposes to thereby treat an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Generally, the invention provides, a method of determining if a subject is at risk for a disorder related to a lesion in or the misexpression of a gene which encodes 67108. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Such disorders include, e.g., a disorder associated with the misexpression of 67108 gene; a disorder of the cardiovascular or neural system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> The method includes one or more of the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the presence or absence of a mutation which affects the expression of the 67108 gene, or detecting the presence or absence of a mutation in a region which controls the expression of the gene, e.g., a mutation in the 5&prime; control region; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the presence or absence of a mutation which alters the structure of the 67108 gene; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the misexpression of the 67108 gene, at the mRNA level, e.g., detecting a non-wild type level of a mRNA; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the misexpression of the gene, at the protein level, e.g., detecting a non-wild type level of a 67108 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments the method includes: ascertaining the existence of at least one of: a deletion of one or more nucleotides from the 67108 gene; an insertion of one or more nucleotides into the gene, a point mutation, e.g., a substitution of one or more nucleotides of the gene, a gross chromosomal rearrangement of the gene, e.g., a translocation, inversion, or deletion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> For example, detecting the genetic lesion can include: (i) providing a probe/primer including an oligonucleotide containing a region of nucleotide sequence which hybridizes to a sense or antisense sequence from SEQ ID NO:1, or naturally occurring mutants thereof or 5&prime; or 3&prime; flanking sequences naturally associated with the 67108 gene; (ii) exposing the probe/primer to nucleic acid of the tissue; and detecting, by hybridization, e.g., in situ hybridization, of the probe/primer to the nucleic acid, the presence or absence of the genetic lesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments detecting the misexpression includes ascertaining the existence of at least one of: an alteration in the level of a messenger RNA transcript of the 67108 gene; the presence of a non-wild type splicing pattern of a messenger RNA transcript of the gene; or a non-wild type level of 67108. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> Methods of the invention can be used prenatally or to determine if a subject&apos;s offspring will be at risk for a disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments the method includes determining the structure of a 67108 gene, an abnormal structure being indicative of risk for the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments the method includes contacting a sample from the subject with an antibody to the 67108 protein or a nucleic acid, which hybridizes specifically with the gene. These and other embodiments are discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> Diagnostic and Prognostic Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Diagnostic and prognostic assays of the invention include method for assessing the expression level of 67108 molecules and for identifying variations and mutations in the sequence of 67108 molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Expression Monitoring and Profiling. The presence, level, or absence of 67108 protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample can be evaluated by obtaining a biological sample from a test subject and contacting the biological sample with a compound or an agent capable of detecting 67108 protein or nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA, genomic DNA) that encodes 67108 protein such that the presence of 67108 protein or nucleic acid is detected in the biological sample. The term &ldquo;biological sample&rdquo; includes tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. A preferred biological sample is serum. The level of expression of the 67108 gene can be measured in a number of ways, including, but not limited to: measuring the mRNA encoded by the 67108 genes; measuring the amount of protein encoded by the 67108 genes; or measuring the activity of the protein encoded by the 67108 genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> The level of mRNA corresponding to the 67108 gene in a cell can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. One preferred diagnostic method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be, for example, a full-length 67108 nucleic acid, such as the nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:1, or a portion thereof, such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7, 15, 30, 50, 100, 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to 67108 mRNA or genomic DNA. The probe can be disposed on an address of an array, e.g., an array described below. Other suitable probes for use in the diagnostic assays are described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> In one format, mRNA (or cDNA) is immobilized on a surface and contacted with the probes, for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative format, the probes are immobilized on a surface and the mRNA (or cDNA) is contacted with the probes, for example, in a two-dimensional gene chip array described below. A skilled artisan can adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoded by the 67108 genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> The level of mRNA in a sample that is encoded by one of 67108 can be evaluated with nucleic acid amplification, e.g., by rtPCR (Mullis (1987) U.S. Patent No. 4,683,202), ligase chain reaction (Barany (1991) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>88:189-193), self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al., (1990) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87:1874-1878), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh et al., (1989), <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:1173-1177), Q-Beta Replicase (Lizardi et al., (1988) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>6:1197), rolling circle replication (Lizardi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033) or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques known in the art. As used herein, amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules that can anneal to 5&prime; or 3&prime; regions of a gene (plus and minus strands, respectively, or vice-versa) and contain a short region in between. In general, amplification primers are from about 10 to 30 nucleotides in length and flank a region from about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under appropriate conditions and with appropriate reagents, such primers permit the amplification of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> For in situ methods, a cell or tissue sample can be prepared/processed and immobilized on a support, typically a glass slide, and then contacted with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the 67108 gene being analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the methods further contacting a control sample with a compound or agent capable of detecting 67108 mRNA, or genomic DNA, and comparing the presence of 67108 mRNA or genomic DNA in the control sample with the presence of 67108 mRNA or genomic DNA in the test sample. In still another embodiment, serial analysis of gene expression, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,937, is used to detect 67108 transcript levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods can be used to determine the level of protein encoded by 67108. In general, these methods include contacting an agent that selectively binds to the protein, such as an antibody with a sample, to evaluate the level of protein in the sample. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody bears a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal, or more preferably, monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., Fab or F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) can be used. The term &ldquo;labeled&rdquo;, with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances are provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> The detection methods can be used to detect 67108 protein in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. In vitro techniques for detection of 67108 protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunoprecipitations, immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and Western blot analysis. In vivo techniques for detection of 67108 protein include introducing into a subject a labeled anti-67108 antibody. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques. In another embodiment, the sample is labeled, e.g., biotinylated and then contacted to the antibody, e.g., an anti-67108 antibody positioned on an antibody array (as described below). The sample can be detected, e.g., with avidin coupled to a fluorescent label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the methods further include contacting the control sample with a compound or agent capable of detecting 67108 protein, and comparing the presence of 67108 protein in the control sample with the presence of 67108 protein in the test sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes kits for detecting the presence of 67108 in a biological sample. For example, the kit can include a compound or agent capable of detecting 67108 protein or mRNA in a biological sample; and a standard. The compound or agent can be packaged in a suitable container. The kit can further comprise instructions for using the kit to detect 67108 protein or nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> For antibody-based kits, the kit can include: (1) a first antibody (e.g., attached to a solid support) which binds to a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention; and, optionally, (2) a second, different antibody which binds to either the polypeptide or the first antibody and is conjugated to a detectable agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> For oligonucleotide-based kits, the kit can include: (1) an oligonucleotide, e.g., a detectably labeled oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention or (2) a pair of primers useful for amplifying a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a marker of the invention. The kit can also includes a buffering agent, a preservative, or a protein stabilizing agent. The kit can also includes components necessary for detecting the detectable agent (e.g., an enzyme or a substrate). The kit can also contain a control sample or a series of control samples which can be assayed and compared to the test sample contained. Each component of the kit can be enclosed within an individual container and all of the various containers can be within a single package, along with instructions for interpreting the results of the assays performed using the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> The diagnostic methods described herein can identify subjects having, or at risk of developing, a disease or disorder associated with misexpressed or aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity. As used herein, the term &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; includes an unwanted phenomenon involved in a biological response such as a phospholipid-associated disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a disease or disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity is identified. A test sample is obtained from a subject and 67108 protein or nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA or genomic DNA) is evaluated, wherein the level, e.g., the presence or absence, of 67108 protein or nucleic acid is diagnostic for a subject having or at risk of developing a disease or disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity. As used herein, a &ldquo;test sample&rdquo; refers to a biological sample obtained from a subject of interest, including a biological fluid (e.g., serum), cell sample, or tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> The prognostic assays described herein can be used to determine whether a subject can be administered an agent (e.g., an agonist, antagonist, peptidomimetic, protein, peptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, or other drug candidate) to treat a disease or disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity. For example, such methods can be used to determine whether a subject can be effectively treated with an agent for a phospholipid associated disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a computer medium having a plurality of digitally encoded data records. Each data record includes a value representing the level of expression of 67108 in a sample, and a descriptor of the sample. The descriptor of the sample can be an identifier of the sample, a subject from which the sample was derived (e.g., a patient), a diagnosis, or a treatment (e.g., a preferred treatment). In a preferred embodiment, the data record further includes values representing the level of expression of genes other than 67108 (e.g., other genes associated with a 67108-disorder, or other genes on an array). The data record can be structured as a table, e.g., a table that is part of a database such as a relational database (e.g., a SQL database of the Oracle or Sybase database environments). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Also featured is a method of evaluating a sample. The method includes providing a sample, e.g., from the subject, and determining a gene expression profile of the sample, wherein the profile includes a value representing the level of 67108 expression. The method can further include comparing the value or the profile (i.e., multiple values) to a reference value or reference profile. The gene expression profile of the sample can be obtained by any of the methods described herein (e.g., by providing a nucleic acid from the sample and contacting the nucleic acid to an array). The method can be used to diagnose a &lsqb;disordera&rsqb; disorder in a subject wherein an change in 67108 expression is an indication that the subject has or is disposed to having a phospholipid-associated disorder. The method can be used to monitor a treatment for a phospholipid-associated disorder in a subject. For example, the gene expression profile can be determined for a sample from a subject undergoing treatment. The profile can be compared to a reference profile or to a profile obtained from the subject prior to treatment or prior to onset of the disorder (see, e.g., Golub et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>286:531). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating a test compound (see also, &ldquo;Screening Assays&rdquo;, above). The method includes providing a cell and a test compound; contacting the test compound to the cell; obtaining a subject expression profile for the contacted cell; and comparing the subject expression profile to one or more reference profiles. The profiles include a value representing the level of 67108 expression. In a preferred embodiment, the subject expression profile is compared to a target profile, e.g., a profile for a normal cell or for desired condition of a cell. The test compound is evaluated favorably if the subject expression profile is more similar to the target profile than an expression profile obtained from an uncontacted cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating a subject. The method includes: a) obtaining a sample from a subject, e.g., from a caregiver, e.g., a caregiver who obtains the sample from the subject; b) determining a subject expression profile for the sample. Optionally, the method further includes either or both of steps: c) comparing the subject expression profile to one or more reference expression profiles; and d) selecting the reference profile most similar to the subject reference profile. The subject expression profile and the reference profiles include a value representing the level of 67108 expression. A variety of routine statistical measures can be used to compare two reference profiles. One possible metric is the length of the distance vector that is the difference between the two profiles. Each of the subject and reference profile is represented as a multi-dimensional vector, wherein each dimension is a value in the profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> The method can further include transmitting a result to a caregiver. The result can be the subject expression profile, a result of a comparison of the subject expression profile with another profile, a most similar reference profile, or a descriptor of any of the aforementioned. The result can be transmitted across a computer network, e.g., the result can be in the form of a computer transmission, e.g., a computer data signal embedded in a carrier wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Also featured is a computer medium having executable code for effecting the following steps: receive a subject expression profile; access a database of reference expression profiles; and either i) select a matching reference profile most similar to the subject expression profile or ii) determine at least one comparison score for the similarity of the subject expression profile to at least one reference profile. The subject expression profile, and the reference expression profiles each include a value representing the level of 67108 expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> Arrays and Uses Thereof </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features an array that includes a substrate having a plurality of addresses. At least one address of the plurality includes a capture probe that binds specifically to a 67108 molecule (e.g., a 67108 nucleic acid or a 67108 polypeptide). The array can have a density of at least than 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 10,000 or more addresses/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and ranges between. In a preferred embodiment, the plurality of addresses includes at least 10, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 50,000 addresses. In a preferred embodiment, the plurality of addresses includes equal to or less than 10, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, or 50,000 addresses. The substrate can be a two-dimensional substrate such as a glass slide, a wafer (e.g., silica or plastic), a mass spectroscopy plate, or a three-dimensional substrate such as a gel pad. Addresses in addition to address of the plurality can be disposed on the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, at least one address of the plurality includes a nucleic acid capture probe that hybridizes specifically to a 67108 nucleic acid, e.g., the sense or anti-sense strand. In one preferred embodiment, a subset of addresses of the plurality of addresses has a nucleic acid capture probe for 67108. Each address of the subset can include a capture probe that hybridizes to a different region of a 67108 nucleic acid. In another preferred embodiment, addresses of the subset include a capture probe for a 67108 nucleic acid. Each address of the subset is unique, overlapping, and complementary to a different variant of 67108 (e.g., an allelic variant, or all possible hypothetical variants). The array can be used to sequence 67108 by hybridization (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,940). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> An array can be generated by various methods, e.g., by photolithographic methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,143,854; 5,510,270; and 5,527,681), mechanical methods (e.g., directed-flow methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261), pin-based methods (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), and bead-based techniques (e.g., as described in PCT US/93/04145). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, at least one address of the plurality includes a polypeptide capture probe that binds specifically to a 67108 polypeptide or fragment thereof. The polypeptide can be a naturally-occurring interaction partner of 67108 polypeptide. Preferably, the polypeptide is an antibody, e.g., an antibody described herein (see &ldquo;Anti-67108 Antibodies,&rdquo; above), such as a monoclonal antibody or a single-chain antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of analyzing the expression of 67108. The method includes providing an array as described above; contacting the array with a sample and detecting binding of a 67108-molecule (e.g., nucleic acid or polypeptide) to the array. In a preferred embodiment, the array is a nucleic acid array. Optionally the method further includes amplifying nucleic acid from the sample prior or during contact with the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the array can be used to assay gene expression in a tissue to ascertain tissue specificity of genes in the array, particularly the expression of 67108. If a sufficient number of diverse samples is analyzed, clustering (e.g., hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, Bayesian clustering and the like) can be used to identify other genes which are co-regulated with 67108. For example, the array can be used for the quantitation of the expression of multiple genes. Thus, not only tissue specificity, but also the level of expression of a battery of genes in the tissue is ascertained. Quantitative data can be used to group (e.g., cluster) genes on the basis of their tissue expression per se and level of expression in that tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> For example, array analysis of gene expression can be used to assess the effect of cell-cell interactions on 67108 expression. A first tissue can be perturbed and nucleic acid from a second tissue that interacts with the first tissue can be analyzed. In this context, the effect of one cell type on another cell type in response to a biological stimulus can be determined, e.g., to monitor the effect of cell-cell interaction at the level of gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, cells are contacted with a therapeutic agent. The expression profile of the cells is determined using the array, and the expression profile is compared to the profile of like cells not contacted with the agent. For example, the assay can be used to determine or analyze the molecular basis of an undesirable effect of the therapeutic agent. If an agent is administered therapeutically to treat one cell type but has an undesirable effect on another cell type, the invention provides an assay to determine the molecular basis of the undesirable effect and thus provides the opportunity to co-administer a counteracting agent or otherwise treat the undesired effect. Similarly, even within a single cell type, undesirable biological effects can be determined at the molecular level. Thus, the effects of an agent on expression of other than the target gene can be ascertained and counteracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the array can be used to monitor expression of one or more genes in the array with respect to time. For example, samples obtained from different time points can be probed with the array. Such analysis can identify and/or characterize the development of a 67108-associated disease or disorder; and processes, such as a cellular transformation associated with a 67108-associated disease or disorder. The method can also evaluate the treatment and/or progression of a 67108-associated disease or disorder </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> The array is also useful for ascertaining differential expression patterns of one or more genes in normal and abnormal cells. This provides a battery of genes (e.g., including 67108) that could serve as a molecular target for diagnosis or therapeutic intervention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features an array having a plurality of addresses. Each address of the plurality includes a unique polypeptide. At least one address of the plurality has disposed thereon a 67108 polypeptide or fragment thereof. Methods of producing polypeptide arrays are described in the art, e.g., in De Wildt et al. (2000). <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>18, 989-994; Lueking et al. (1999). <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>270, 103-111; Ge, H. (2000). <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>28, e3, I-VII; MacBeath, G., and Schreiber, S. L. (2000). <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>289, 1760-1763; and WO 99/51773A1. In a preferred embodiment, each addresses of the plurality has disposed thereon a polypeptide at least 60, 70, 80,85, 90, 95 or 99% identical to a 67108 polypeptide or fragment thereof. For example, multiple variants of a 67108 polypeptide (e.g., encoded by allelic variants, site-directed mutants, random mutants, or combinatorial mutants) can be disposed at individual addresses of the plurality. Addresses in addition to the address of the plurality can be disposed on the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> The polypeptide array can be used to detect a 67108 binding compound, e.g., an antibody in a sample from a subject with specificity for a 67108 polypeptide or the presence of a 67108-binding protein or ligand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> The array is also useful for ascertaining the effect of the expression of a gene on the expression of other genes in the same cell or in different cells (e.g., ascertaining the effect of 67108 expression on the expression of other genes). This provides, for example, for a selection of alternate molecular targets for therapeutic intervention if the ultimate or downstream target cannot be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of analyzing a plurality of probes. The method is useful, e.g., for analyzing gene expression. The method includes: providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, e.g., wherein the capture probes are from a cell or subject which express 67108 or from a cell or subject in which a 67108 mediated response has been elicited, e.g., by contact of the cell with 67108 nucleic acid or protein, or administration to the cell or subject 67108 nucleic acid or protein; providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality, and each address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, e.g., wherein the capture probes are from a cell or subject which does not express 67108 (or does not express as highly as in the case of the 67108 positive plurality of capture probes) or from a cell or subject which in which a 67108 mediated response has not been elicited (or has been elicited to a lesser extent than in the first sample); contacting the array with one or more inquiry probes (which is preferably other than a 67108 nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody), and thereby evaluating the plurality of capture probes. Binding, e.g., in the case of a nucleic acid, hybridization with a capture probe at an address of the plurality, is detected, e.g., by signal generated from a label attached to the nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of analyzing a plurality of probes or a sample. The method is useful, e.g., for analyzing gene expression. The method includes: providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, contacting the array with a first sample from a cell or subject which express or mis-express 67108 or from a cell or subject in which a 67108-mediated response has been elicited, e.g., by contact of the cell with 67108 nucleic acid or protein, or administration to the cell or subject 67108 nucleic acid or protein; providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality, and each address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, and contacting the array with a second sample from a cell or subject which does not express 67108 (or does not express as highly as in the case of the 67108 positive plurality of capture probes) or from a cell or subject which in which a 67108 mediated response has not been elicited (or has been elicited to a lesser extent than in the first sample); and comparing the binding of the first sample with the binding of the second sample. Binding, e.g., in the case of a nucleic acid, hybridization with a capture probe at an address of the plurality, is detected, e.g., by signal generated from a label attached to the nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody. The same array can be used for both samples or different arrays can be used. If different arrays are used the plurality of addresses with capture probes should be present on both arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of analyzing 67108, e.g., analyzing structure, function, or relatedness to other nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. The method includes: providing a 67108 nucleic acid or amino acid sequence; comparing the 67108 sequence with one or more preferably a plurality of sequences from a collection of sequences, e.g., a nucleic acid or protein sequence database; to thereby analyze 67108. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> Detection of Variations or Mutations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> The methods of the invention can also be used to detect genetic alterations in a 67108 gene, thereby determining if a subject with the altered gene is at risk for a disorder characterized by misregulation in 67108 protein activity or nucleic acid expression, such as a phospholipid-associated disorder. In preferred embodiments, the methods include detecting, in a sample from the subject, the presence or absence of a genetic alteration characterized by at least one of an alteration affecting the integrity of a gene encoding a 67108-protein, or the mis-expression of the 67108 gene. For example, such genetic alterations can be detected by ascertaining the existence of at least one of 1) a deletion of one or more nucleotides from a 67108 gene; 2) an addition of one or more nucleotides to a 67108 gene; 3) a substitution of one or more nucleotides of a 67108 gene, 4) a chromosomal rearrangement of a 67108 gene; 5) an alteration in the level of a messenger RNA transcript of a 67108 gene, 6) aberrant modification of a 67108 gene, such as of the methylation pattern of the genomic DNA, 7) the presence of a non-wild type splicing pattern of a messenger RNA transcript of a 67108 gene, 8) a non-wild type level of a 67108-protein, 9) allelic loss of a 67108 gene, and 10) inappropriate post-translational modification of a 67108-protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> An alteration can be detected without a probe/primer in a polymerase chain reaction, such as anchor PCR or RACE PCR, or, alternatively, in a ligation chain reaction (LCR), the latter of which can be particularly useful for detecting point mutations in the 67108-gene. This method can include the steps of collecting a sample of cells from a subject, isolating nucleic acid (e.g., genomic, mRNA or both) from the sample, contacting the nucleic acid sample with one or more primers which specifically hybridize to a 67108 gene under conditions such that hybridization and amplification of the 67108-gene (if present) occurs, and detecting the presence or absence of an amplification product, or detecting the size of the amplification product and comparing the length to a control sample. It is anticipated that PCR and/or LCR may be desirable to use as a preliminary amplification step in conjunction with any of the techniques used for detecting mutations described herein. Alternatively, other amplification methods described herein or known in the art can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, mutations in a 67108 gene from a sample cell can be identified by detecting alterations in restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. For example, sample and control DNA is isolated, amplified (optionally), digested with one or more restriction endonucleases, and fragment length sizes are determined, e.g., by gel electrophoresis and compared. Differences in fragment length sizes between sample and control DNA indicates mutations in the sample DNA. Moreover, the use of sequence specific ribozymes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,531) can be used to score for the presence of specific mutations by development or loss of a ribozyme cleavage site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, genetic mutations in 67108 can be identified by hybridizing a sample and control nucleic acids, e.g., DNA or RNA, two-dimensional arrays, e.g., chip based arrays. Such arrays include a plurality of addresses, each of which is positionally distinguishable from the other. A different probe is located at each address of the plurality. A probe can be complementary to a region of a 67108 nucleic acid or a putative variant (e.g., allelic variant) thereof. A probe can have one or more mismatches to a region of a 67108 nucleic acid (e.g., a destabilizing mismatch). The arrays can have a high density of addresses, e.g., can contain hundreds or thousands of oligonucleotides probes (Cronin, M. T. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Human Mutation </italic></highlight>7: 244-255; Kozal, M. J. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Nature Medicine </italic></highlight>2: 753-759). For example, genetic mutations in 67108 can be identified in two-dimensional arrays containing light-generated DNA probes as described in Cronin, M. T. et al. supra. Briefly, a first hybridization array of probes can be used to scan through long stretches of DNA in a sample and control to identify base changes between the sequences by making linear arrays of sequential overlapping probes. This step allows the identification of point mutations. This step is followed by a second hybridization array that allows the characterization of specific mutations by using smaller, specialized probe arrays complementary to all variants or mutations detected. Each mutation array is composed of parallel probe sets, one complementary to the wild-type gene and the other complementary to the mutant gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to directly sequence the 67108 gene and detect mutations by comparing the sequence of the sample 67108 with the corresponding wild-type (control) sequence. Automated sequencing procedures can be utilized when performing the diagnostic assays ((1995) <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>19:448), including sequencing by mass spectrometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> Other methods for detecting mutations in the 67108 gene include methods in which protection from cleavage agents is used to detect mismatched bases in RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA heteroduplexes (Myers et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>230:1242; Cotton et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA </italic></highlight>85:4397; Saleeba et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>217:286-295). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, the mismatch cleavage reaction employs one or more proteins that recognize mismatched base pairs in double-stranded DNA (so called &ldquo;DNA mismatch repair&rdquo; enzymes) in defined systems for detecting and mapping point mutations in 67108 cDNAs obtained from samples of cells. For example, the mutY enzyme of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cleaves A at G/A mismatches and the thymidine DNA glycosylase from HeLa cells cleaves T at G/T mismatches (Hsu et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Carcinogenesis </italic></highlight>15:1657-1662; U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,039). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, alterations in electrophoretic mobility will be used to identify mutations in 67108 genes. For example, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) may be used to detect differences in electrophoretic mobility between mutant and wild type nucleic acids (Orita et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA: </italic></highlight>86:2766, see also Cotton (1993) <highlight><italic>Mutat. Res. </italic></highlight>285:125-144; and Hayashi (1992) <highlight><italic>Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. </italic></highlight>9:73-79). Single-stranded DNA fragments of sample and control 67108 nucleic acids will be denatured and allowed to renature. The secondary structure of single-stranded nucleic acids varies according to sequence, the resulting alteration in electrophoretic mobility enables the detection of even a single base change. The DNA fragments may be labeled or detected with labeled probes. The sensitivity of the assay may be enhanced by using RNA (rather than DNA), in which the secondary structure is more sensitive to a change in sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the subject method utilizes heteroduplex analysis to separate double stranded heteroduplex molecules on the basis of changes in electrophoretic mobility (Keen et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Trends Genet </italic></highlight>7:5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the movement of mutant or wild-type fragments in polyacrylamide gels containing a gradient of denaturant is assayed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Myers et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>313:495). When DGGE is used as the method of analysis, DNA will be modified to insure that it does not completely denature, for example by adding a GC clamp of approximately 40 bp of high-melting GC-rich DNA by PCR. In a further embodiment, a temperature gradient is used in place of a denaturing gradient to identify differences in the mobility of control and sample DNA (Rosenbaum and Reissner (1987) <highlight><italic>Biophys Chem </italic></highlight>265:12753). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> Examples of other techniques for detecting point mutations include, but are not limited to, selective oligonucleotide hybridization, selective amplification, or selective primer extension (Saiki et al. (1986) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>324:163); Saiki et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci USA </italic></highlight>86:6230). A further method of detecting point mutations is the chemical ligation of oligonucleotides as described in Xu et al. ((2001) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>19:148). Adjacent oligonucleotides, one of which selectively anneals to the query site, are ligated together if the nucleotide at the query site of the sample nucleic acid is complementary to the query oligonucleotide; ligation can be monitored, e.g., by fluorescent dyes coupled to the oligonucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, allele specific amplification technology that depends on selective PCR amplification may be used in conjunction with the instant invention. Oligonucleotides used as primers for specific amplification may carry the mutation of interest in the center of the molecule (so that amplification depends on differential hybridization) (Gibbs et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>17:2437-2448) or at the extreme 3&prime; end of one primer where, under appropriate conditions, mismatch can prevent, or reduce polymerase extension (Prossner (1993) <highlight><italic>Tibtech </italic></highlight>11:238). In addition it may be desirable to introduce a novel restriction site in the region of the mutation to create cleavage-based detection (Gasparini et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell Probes </italic></highlight>6:1). It is anticipated that in certain embodiments amplification may also be performed using Taq ligase for amplification (Barany (1991) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA </italic></highlight>88:189). In such cases, ligation will occur only if there is a perfect match at the 3&prime; end of the 5&prime; sequence making it possible to detect the presence of a known mutation at a specific site by looking for the presence or absence of amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a set of oligonucleotides. The set includes a plurality of oligonucleotides, each of which is at least partially complementary (e.g., at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% complementary) to a 67108 nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the set includes a first and a second oligonucleotide. The first and second oligonucleotide can hybridize to the same or to different locations of SEQ ID NO:1 or the complement of SEQ ID NO:1. Different locations can be different but overlapping, or non-overlapping on the same strand. The first and second oligonucleotide can hybridize to sites on the same or on different strands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> The set can be useful, e.g., for identifying SNP&apos;s, or identifying specific alleles of 67108. In a preferred embodiment, each oligonucleotide of the set has a different nucleotide at an interrogation position. In one embodiment, the set includes two oligonucleotides, each complementary to a different allele at a locus, e.g., a biallelic or polymorphic locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the set includes four oligonucleotides, each having a different nucleotide (e.g., adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymidine) at the interrogation position. The interrogation position can be a SNP or the site of a mutation. In another preferred embodiment, the oligonucleotides of the plurality are identical in sequence to one another (except for differences in length). The oligonucleotides can be provided with differential labels, such that an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to one allele provides a signal that is distinguishable from an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to a second allele. In still another embodiment, at least one of the oligonucleotides of the set has a nucleotide change at a position in addition to a query position, e.g., a destabilizing mutation to decrease the Tm of the oligonucleotide. In another embodiment, at least one oligonucleotide of the set has a non-natural nucleotide, e.g., inosine. In a preferred embodiment, the oligonucleotides are attached to a solid support, e.g., to different addresses of an array or to different beads or nanoparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the set of oligo nucleotides can be used to specifically amplify, e.g., by PCR, or detect, a 67108 nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> The methods described herein may be performed, for example, by utilizing pre-packaged diagnostic kits comprising at least one probe nucleic acid or antibody reagent described herein, which may be conveniently used, e.g., in clinical settings to diagnose patients exhibiting symptoms or family history of a disease or illness involving a 67108 gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> Use of 67108 Molecules as Surrogate Markers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules of the invention are also useful as markers of disorders or disease states, as markers for precursors of disease states, as markers for predisposition of disease states, as markers of drug activity, or as markers of the pharmacogenomic profile of a subject. Using the methods described herein, the presence, absence and/or quantity of the 67108 molecules of the invention may be detected, and may be correlated with one or more biological states in vivo. For example, the 67108 molecules of the invention may serve as surrogate markers for one or more disorders or disease states or for conditions leading up to disease states. As used herein, a &ldquo;surrogate marker&rdquo; is an objective biochemical marker which correlates with the absence or presence of a disease or disorder, or with the progression of a disease or disorder (e.g., with the presence or absence of a tumor). The presence or quantity of such markers is independent of the disease. Therefore, these markers may serve to indicate whether a particular course of treatment is effective in lessening a disease state or disorder. Surrogate markers are of particular use when the presence or extent of a disease state or disorder is difficult to assess through standard methodologies (e.g., early stage tumors), or when an assessment of disease progression is desired before a potentially dangerous clinical endpoint is reached (e.g., an assessment of cardiovascular disease may be made using cholesterol levels as a surrogate marker, and an analysis of HIV infection may be made using HIV RNA levels as a surrogate marker, well in advance of the undesirable clinical outcomes of myocardial infarction or fully-developed AIDS). Examples of the use of surrogate markers in the art include: Koomen et al. (2000) <highlight><italic>J. Mass. Spectrom. </italic></highlight>35: 258-264; and James (1994) <highlight><italic>AIDS Treatment News Archive </italic></highlight>209. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules of the invention are also useful as pharmacodynamic markers. As used herein, a &ldquo;pharmacodynamic marker&rdquo; is an objective biochemical marker which correlates specifically with drug effects. The presence or quantity of a pharmacodynamic marker is not related to the disease state or disorder for which the drug is being administered; therefore, the presence or quantity of the marker is indicative of the presence or activity of the drug in a subject. For example, a pharmacodynamic marker may be indicative of the concentration of the drug in a biological tissue, in that the marker is either expressed or transcribed or not expressed or transcribed in that tissue in relationship to the level of the drug. In this fashion, the distribution or uptake of the drug may be monitored by the pharmacodynamic marker. Similarly, the presence or quantity of the pharmacodynamic marker may be related to the presence or quantity of the metabolic product of a drug, such that the presence or quantity of the marker is indicative of the relative breakdown rate of the drug in vivo. Pharmacodynamic markers are of particular use in increasing the sensitivity of detection of drug effects, particularly when the drug is administered in low doses. Since even a small amount of a drug may be sufficient to activate multiple rounds of marker (e.g., a 67108 marker) transcription or expression, the amplified marker may be in a quantity which is more readily detectable than the drug itself. Also, the marker may be more easily detected due to the nature of the marker itself; for example, using the methods described herein, anti-67108 antibodies may be employed in an immune-based detection system for a 67108 protein marker, or 67108-specific radiolabeled probes may be used to detect a 67108 mRNA marker. Furthermore, the use of a pharmacodynamic marker may offer mechanism-based prediction of risk due to drug treatment beyond the range of possible direct observations. Examples of the use of pharmacodynamic markers in the art include: Matsuda et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,862; Hattis et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Env. Health Perspect. </italic></highlight>90: 229-238; Schentag (1999) <highlight><italic>Am. J. Health-Syst. Pharm. </italic></highlight>56 Suppl. 3: S21-S24; and Nicolau (1999) <highlight><italic>Am, J. Health-Syst. Pharm. </italic></highlight>56 Suppl. 3: S16-S20. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules of the invention are also useful as pharmacogenomic markers. As used herein, a &ldquo;pharmacogenomic marker&rdquo; is an objective biochemical marker which correlates with a specific clinical drug response or susceptibility in a subject (see, e.g., McLeod et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>35:1650-1652). The presence or quantity of the pharmacogenomic marker is related to the predicted response of the subject to a specific drug or class of drugs prior to administration of the drug. By assessing the presence or quantity of one or more pharmacogenomic markers in a subject, a drug therapy which is most appropriate for the subject, or which is predicted to have a greater degree of success, may be selected. For example, based on the presence or quantity of RNA, or protein (e.g., 67108 protein or RNA) for specific tumor markers in a subject, a drug or course of treatment may be selected that is optimized for the treatment of the specific tumor likely to be present in the subject. Similarly, the presence or absence of a specific sequence mutation in 67108 DNA may correlate 67108 drug response. The use of pharmacogenomic markers therefore permits the application of the most appropriate treatment for each subject without having to administer the therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical Compositions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid and polypeptides, fragments thereof, as well as anti-67108 antibodies (also referred to herein as &ldquo;active compounds&rdquo;) of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions typically include the nucleic acid molecule, protein, or antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language &ldquo;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&rdquo; includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> A pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL&trade; (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>/ED<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The protein or polypeptide can be administered one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> For antibodies, the preferred dosage is 0.1 mg/kg of body weight (generally 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg). If the antibody is to act in the brain, a dosage of 50 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg is usually appropriate. Generally, partially human antibodies and fully human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than other antibodies. Accordingly, lower dosages and less frequent administration is often possible. Modifications such as lipidation can be used to stabilize antibodies and to enhance uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain). A method for lipidation of antibodies is described by Cruikshank et al. ((1997) <highlight><italic>J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology </italic></highlight>14:193). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> The present invention encompasses agents which modulate expression or activity. An agent may, for example, be a small molecule. For example, such small molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, peptidomimetics (e.g., peptoids), amino acids, amino acid analogs, polynucleotides, polynucleotide analogs, nucleotides, nucleotide analogs, organic or inorganic compounds (i.e., including heteroorganic and organometallic compounds) having a molecular weight less than about 10,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 5,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 1,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 500 grams per mole, and salts, esters, and other pharmaceutically acceptable forms of such compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the small molecule per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram. It is furthermore understood that appropriate doses of a small molecule depend upon the potency of the small molecule with respect to the expression or activity to be modulated. When one or more of these small molecules is to be administered to an animal (e.g., a human) in order to modulate expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid of the invention, a physician, veterinarian, or researcher may, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. In addition, it is understood that the specific dose level for any particular animal subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, any drug combination, and the degree of expression or activity to be modulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> An antibody (or fragment thereof) may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, puromycin, maytansinoids, e.g., maytansinol (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), CC-1065 (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092, 5,585,499, 5,846,545) and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, CC-1065, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, taxol and maytansinoids). Radioactive ions include, but are not limited to iodine, yttrium and praseodymium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, &agr;-interferon, &bgr;-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (&ldquo;IL-1&rdquo;), interleukin-2 (&ldquo;IL-2&rdquo;), interleukin-6 (&ldquo;IL-6&rdquo;), granulocyte macrophase colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;GM-CSF&rdquo;), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;G-CSF&rdquo;), or other growth factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g., Chen et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>91:3054-3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> Methods of Treatment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) a disorder or having a disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity. As used herein, the term &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; is defined as the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, who has a disease, a symptom of disease or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease or the predisposition toward disease. A therapeutic agent includes, but is not limited to, small molecules, peptides, antibodies, ribozymes and antisense oligonucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> With regards to both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of treatment, such treatments may be specifically tailored or modified, based on knowledge obtained from the field of pharmacogenomics. &ldquo;Pharmacogenomics&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to the application of genomics technologies such as gene sequencing, statistical genetics, and gene expression analysis to drugs in clinical development and on the market. More specifically, the term refers the study of how a patient&apos;s genes determine his or her response to a drug (e.g., a patient&apos;s &ldquo;drug response phenotype&rdquo;, or &ldquo;drug response genotype&rdquo;.) Thus, another aspect of the invention provides methods for tailoring an individual&apos;s prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with either the 67108 molecules of the present invention or 67108 modulators according to that individual&apos;s drug response genotype. Pharmacogenomics allows a clinician or physician to target prophylactic or therapeutic treatments to patients who will most benefit from the treatment and to avoid treatment of patients who will experience toxic drug-related side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention provides a method for preventing in a subject, a disease or condition associated with an aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity, by administering to the subject a 67108 or an agent which modulates 67108 expression or at least one 67108 activity. Subjects at risk for a disease which is caused or contributed to by aberrant or unwanted 67108 expression or activity can be identified by, for example, any or a combination of diagnostic or prognostic assays as described herein. Administration of a prophylactic agent can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the 67108 aberrance, such that a disease or disorder is prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression. Depending on the type of 67108 aberrance, for example, a 67108, 67108 agonist or 67108 antagonist agent can be used for treating the subject. The appropriate agent can be determined based on screening assays described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> It is possible that some 67108 disorders can be caused, at least in part, by an abnormal level of gene product, or by the presence of a gene product exhibiting abnormal activity. As such, the reduction in the level and/or activity of such gene products would bring about the amelioration of disorder symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules can act as novel diagnostic targets and therapeutic agents for controlling one or more of, e.g., cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders, immune disorders, cardiovascular disorders, apoptotic disorders, hormonal disorders, neurological disorders, and blood coagulation disorders, as described above, as well as, disorders associated with pain or metabolic disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> Additionally, 67108 may play an important role in the regulation of metabolism or pain disorders. Diseases of metabolic imbalance include, but are not limited to, obesity, anorexia nervosa, cachexia, lipid disorders, and diabetes. Examples of pain disorders include, but are not limited to, pain response elicited during various forms of tissue injury, e.g., inflammation, infection, and ischemia, usually referred to as hyperalgesia (described in, for example, Fields, H. L. (1987) <highlight><italic>Pain, </italic></highlight>New York:McGraw-Hill); pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders, e.g., joint pain; tooth pain; headaches; pain associated with surgery; pain related to irritable bowel syndrome; or chest pain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> As discussed, successful treatment of 67108 disorders can be brought about by techniques that serve to inhibit the expression or activity of target gene products. For example, compounds, e.g., an agent identified using an assays described above, that proves to exhibit negative modulatory activity, can be used in accordance with the invention to prevent and/or ameliorate symptoms of 67108 disorders. Such molecules can include, but are not limited to peptides, phosphopeptides, small organic or inorganic molecules, or antibodies (including, for example, polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, anti-idiotypic, chimeric or single chain antibodies, and Fab, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Fab expression library fragments, scFV molecules, and epitope-binding fragments thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> Further, antisense and ribozyme molecules that inhibit expression of the target gene can also be used in accordance with the invention to reduce the level of target gene expression, thus effectively reducing the level of target gene activity. Still further, triple helix molecules can be utilized in reducing the level of target gene activity. Antisense, ribozyme and triple helix molecules are discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> It is possible that the use of antisense, ribozyme, and/or triple helix molecules to reduce or inhibit mutant gene expression can also reduce or inhibit the transcription (triple helix) and/or translation (antisense, ribozyme) of mRNA produced by normal target gene alleles, such that the concentration of normal target gene product present can be lower than is necessary for a normal phenotype. In such cases, nucleic acid molecules that encode and express target gene polypeptides exhibiting normal target gene activity can be introduced into cells via gene therapy method. Alternatively, in instances in that the target gene encodes an extracellular protein, it can be preferable to co-administer normal target gene protein into the cell or tissue in order to maintain the requisite level of cellular or tissue target gene activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> Another method by which nucleic acid molecules may be utilized in treating or preventing a disease characterized by 67108 expression is through the use of aptamer molecules specific for 67108 protein. Aptamers are nucleic acid molecules having a tertiary structure which permits them to specifically bind to protein ligands (see, e.g., Osborne, et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Chem Biol. </italic></highlight>1: 5-9; and Patel, D. J. (1997) <highlight><italic>Curr Opin Chem Biol </italic></highlight>1:32-46). Since nucleic acid molecules may in many cases be more conveniently introduced into target cells than therapeutic protein molecules may be, aptamers offer a method by which 67108 protein activity may be specifically decreased without the introduction of drugs or other molecules which may have pluripotent effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Antibodies can be generated that are both specific for target gene product and that reduce target gene product activity. Such antibodies may, therefore, by administered in instances whereby negative modulatory techniques are appropriate for the treatment of 67108 disorders. For a description of antibodies, see the Antibody section above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> In circumstances wherein injection of an animal or a human subject with a 67108 protein or epitope for stimulating antibody production is harmful to the subject, it is possible to generate an immune response against 67108 through the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies (see, for example, Herlyn, D. (1999) <highlight><italic>Ann Med </italic></highlight>31:66-78; and Bhattacharya-Chatterjee, M., and Foon, K. A. (1998) <highlight><italic>Cancer Treat Res. </italic></highlight>94:51-68). If an anti-idiotypic antibody is introduced into a mammal or human subject, it should stimulate the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies, which should be specific to the 67108 protein. Vaccines directed to a disease characterized by 67108 expression may also be generated in this fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> In instances where the target antigen is intracellular and whole antibodies are used, internalizing antibodies may be preferred. Lipofectin or liposomes can be used to deliver the antibody or a fragment of the Fab region that binds to the target antigen into cells. Where fragments of the antibody are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that binds to the target antigen is preferred. For example, peptides having an amino acid sequence corresponding to the Fv region of the antibody can be used. Alternatively, single chain neutralizing antibodies that bind to intracellular target antigens can also be administered. Such single chain antibodies can be administered, for example, by expressing nucleotide sequences encoding single-chain antibodies within the target cell population (see e.g., Marasco et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:7889-7893). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> The identified compounds that inhibit target gene expression, synthesis and/or activity can be administered to a patient at therapeutically effective doses to prevent, treat or ameliorate 67108 disorders. A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms of the disorders. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> Another example of determination of effective dose for an individual is the ability to directly assay levels of &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;bound&rdquo; compound in the serum of the test subject. Such assays may utilize antibody mimics and/or &ldquo;biosensors&rdquo; that have been created through molecular imprinting techniques. The compound which is able to modulate 67108 activity is used as a template, or &ldquo;imprinting molecule&rdquo;, to spatially organize polymerizable monomers prior to their polymerization with catalytic reagents. The subsequent removal of the imprinted molecule leaves a polymer matrix which contains a repeated &ldquo;negative image&rdquo; of the compound and is able to selectively rebind the molecule under biological assay conditions. A detailed review of this technique can be seen in Ansell, R. J. et al (1996) <highlight><italic>Current Opinion in Biotechnology </italic></highlight>7:89-94 and in Shea, K. J. (1994) <highlight><italic>Trends in Polymer Science </italic></highlight>2:166-173. Such &ldquo;imprinted&rdquo; affinity matrixes are amenable to ligand-binding assays, whereby the immobilized monoclonal antibody component is replaced by an appropriately imprinted matrix. An example of the use of such matrixes in this way can be seen in Vlatakis, G. et al (1993) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>361:645-647. Through the use of isotope-labeling, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; concentration of compound which modulates the expression or activity of 67108 can be readily monitored and used in calculations of IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Such &ldquo;imprinted&rdquo; affinity matrixes can also be designed to include fluorescent groups whose photon-emitting properties measurably change upon local and selective binding of target compound. These changes can be readily assayed in real time using appropriate fiberoptic devices, in turn allowing the dose in a test subject to be quickly optimized based on its individual IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>. An rudimentary example of such a &ldquo;biosensor&rdquo; is discussed in Kriz, D. et al (1995) <highlight><italic>Analytical Chemistry </italic></highlight>67:2142-2144. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention pertains to methods of modulating 67108 expression or activity for therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment, the modulatory method of the invention involves contacting a cell with a 67108 or agent that modulates one or more of the activities of 67108 protein activity associated with the cell. An agent that modulates 67108 protein activity can be an agent as described herein, such as a nucleic acid or a protein, a naturally-occurring target molecule of a 67108 protein (e.g., a 67108 substrate or receptor), a 67108 antibody, a 67108 agonist or antagonist, a peptidomimetic of a 67108 agonist or antagonist, or other small molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the agent stimulates one or 67108 activities. Examples of such stimulatory agents include active 67108 protein and a nucleic acid molecule encoding 67108. In another embodiment, the agent inhibits one or more 67108 activities. Examples of such inhibitory agents include antisense 67108 nucleic acid molecules, anti-67108 antibodies, and 67108 inhibitors. These modulatory methods can be performed in vitro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the agent) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g., by administering the agent to a subject). As such, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with a disease or disorder characterized by aberrant or unwanted expression or activity of a 67108 protein or nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the method involves administering an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein), or combination of agents that modulates (e.g., up regulates or down regulates) 67108 expression or activity. In another embodiment, the method involves administering a 67108 protein or nucleic acid molecule as therapy to compensate for reduced, aberrant, or unwanted 67108 expression or activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> Stimulation of 67108 activity is desirable in situations in which 67108 is abnormally downregulated and/or in which increased 67108 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. For example, stimulation of 67108 activity is desirable in situations in which a 67108 is downregulated and/or in which increased 67108 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. Likewise, inhibition of 67108 activity is desirable in situations in which 67108 is abnormally upregulated and/or in which decreased 67108 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> Pharmacogenomics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> The 67108 molecules of the present invention, as well as agents, or modulators which have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on 67108 activity (e.g., 67108 gene expression) as identified by a screening assay described herein can be administered to individuals to treat (prophylactically or therapeutically) 67108 associated disorders (e.g., phospholipid-associated disorders). In conjunction with such treatment, pharmacogenomics (i.e., the study of the relationship between an individual&apos;s genotype and that individual&apos;s response to a foreign compound or drug) may be considered. Differences in metabolism of therapeutics can lead to severe toxicity or therapeutic failure by altering the relation between dose and blood concentration of the pharmacologically active drug. Thus, a physician or clinician may consider applying knowledge obtained in relevant pharmacogenomics studies in determining whether to administer a 67108 molecule or 67108 modulator as well as tailoring the dosage and/or therapeutic regimen of treatment with a 67108 molecule or 67108 modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant hereditary variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug disposition and abnormal action in affected persons. See, for example, Eichelbaum, M. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. </italic></highlight>23:983-985 and Linder, M. W. et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Clin. Chem. </italic></highlight>43:254-266. In general, two types of pharmacogenetic conditions can be differentiated. Genetic conditions transmitted as a single factor altering the way drugs act on the body (altered drug action) or genetic conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the body acts on drugs (altered drug metabolism). These pharmacogenetic conditions can occur either as rare genetic defects or as naturally-occurring polymorphisms. For example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) is a common inherited enzymopathy in which the main clinical complication is haemolysis after ingestion of oxidant drugs (anti-malarials, sulfonamides, analgesics, nitrofurans) and consumption of fava beans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> One pharmacogenomics approach to identifying genes that predict drug response, known as &ldquo;a genome-wide association&rdquo;, relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the human genome consisting of already known gene-related markers (e.g., a &ldquo;bi-allelic&rdquo; gene marker map which consists of 60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human genome, each of which has two variants.) Such a high-resolution genetic map can be compared to a map of the genome of each of a statistically significant number of patients taking part in a Phase II/III drug trial to identify markers associated with a particular observed drug response or side effect. Alternatively, such a high resolution map can be generated from a combination of some ten-million known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. As used herein, a &ldquo;SNP&rdquo; is a common alteration that occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA. For example, a SNP may occur once per every 1000 bases of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process, however, the vast majority may not be disease-associated. Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs, individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depending on a particular pattern of SNPs in their individual genome. In such a manner, treatment regimens can be tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking into account traits that may be common among such genetically similar individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a method termed the &ldquo;candidate gene approach,&rdquo; can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. According to this method, if a gene that encodes a drug&apos;s target is known (e.g., a 67108 protein of the present invention), all common variants of that gene can be fairly easily identified in the population and it can be determined if having one version of the gene versus another is associated with a particular drug response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a method termed the &ldquo;gene expression profiling,&rdquo; can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. For example, the gene expression of an animal dosed with a drug (e.g., a 67108 molecule or 67108 modulator of the present invention) can give an indication whether gene pathways related to toxicity have been turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Information generated from more than one of the above pharmacogenomics approaches can be used to determine appropriate dosage and treatment regimens for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of an individual. This knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efficiency when treating a subject with a 67108 molecule or 67108 modulator, such as a modulator identified by one of the exemplary screening assays described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides methods for identifying new agents, or combinations, that are based on identifying agents that modulate the activity of one or more of the gene products encoded by one or more of the 67108 genes of the present invention, wherein these products may be associated with resistance of the cells to a therapeutic agent. Specifically, the activity of the proteins encoded by the 67108 genes of the present invention can be used as a basis for identifying agents for overcoming agent resistance. By blocking the activity of one or more of the resistance proteins, target cells, e.g., human cells, will become sensitive to treatment with an agent that the unmodified target cells were resistant to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> Monitoring the influence of agents (e.g., drugs) on the expression or activity of a 67108 protein can be applied in clinical trials. For example, the effectiveness of an agent determined by a screening assay as described herein to increase 67108 gene expression, protein levels, or upregulate 67108 activity, can be monitored in clinical trials of subjects exhibiting decreased 67108 gene expression, protein levels, or downregulated 67108 activity. Alternatively, the effectiveness of an agent determined by a screening assay to decrease 67108 gene expression, protein levels, or downregulate 67108 activity, can be monitored in clinical trials of subjects exhibiting increased 67108 gene expression, protein levels, or upregulated 67108 activity. In such clinical trials, the expression or activity of a 67108 gene, and preferably, other genes that have been implicated in, for example, a 67108-associated disorder can be used as a &ldquo;read out&rdquo; or markers of the phenotype of a particular cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> 67108 Informatics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> The sequence of a 67108 molecule is provided in a variety of media to facilitate use thereof. A sequence can be provided as a manufacture, other than an isolated nucleic acid or amino acid molecule, which contains a 67108. Such a manufacture can provide a nucleotide or amino acid sequence, e.g., an open reading frame, in a form which allows examination of the manufacture using means not directly applicable to examining the nucleotide or amino acid sequences, or a subset thereof, as they exists in nature or in purified form. The sequence information can include, but is not limited to, 67108 full-length nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, partial nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, polymorphic sequences including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), epitope sequence, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the manufacture is a machine-readable medium, e.g., a magnetic, optical, chemical or mechanical information storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;machine-readable media&rdquo; refers to any medium that can be read and accessed directly by a machine, e.g., a digital computer or analogue computer. Non-limiting examples of a computer include a desktop PC, laptop, mainframe, server (e.g., a web server, network server, or server farm), handheld digital assistant, pager, mobile telephone, and the like. The computer can be stand-alone or connected to a communications network, e.g., a local area network (such as a VPN or intranet), a wide area network (e.g., an Extranet or the Internet), or a telephone network (e.g., a wireless, DSL, or ISDN network). Machine-readable media include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media, such as floppy discs, hard disc storage medium, and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as CD-ROM; electrical storage media such as RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, and the like; and hybrids of these categories such as magnetic/optical storage media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> A variety of data storage structures are available to a skilled artisan for creating a machine-readable medium having recorded thereon a nucleotide or amino acid sequence of the present invention. The choice of the data storage structure will generally be based on the means chosen to access the stored information. In addition, a variety of data processor programs and formats can be used to store the nucleotide sequence information of the present invention on computer readable medium. The sequence information can be represented in a word processing text file, formatted in commercially-available software such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word, or represented in the form of an ASCII file, stored in a database application, such as DB2, Sybase, Oracle, or the like. The skilled artisan can readily adapt any number of data processor structuring formats (e.g., text file or database) in order to obtain computer readable medium having recorded thereon the nucleotide sequence information of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the sequence information is stored in a relational database (such as Sybase or Oracle). The database can have a first table for storing sequence (nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequence) information. The sequence information can be stored in one field (e.g., a first column) of a table row and an identifier for the sequence can be store in another field (e.g., a second column) of the table row. The database can have a second table, e.g., storing annotations. The second table can have a field for the sequence identifier, a field for a descriptor or annotation text (e.g., the descriptor can refer to a functionality of the sequence, a field for the initial position in the sequence to which the annotation refers, and a field for the ultimate position in the sequence to which the annotation refers. Non-limiting examples for annotation to nucleic acid sequences include polymorphisms (e.g., SNP&apos;s) translational regulatory sites and splice junctions. Non-limiting examples for annotations to amino acid sequence include polypeptide domains, e.g., a domain described herein; active sites and other functional amino acids; and modification sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> By providing the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of the invention in computer readable form, the skilled artisan can routinely access the sequence information for a variety of purposes. For example, one skilled in the art can use the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of the invention in computer readable form to compare a target sequence or target structural motif with the sequence information stored within the data storage means. A search is used to identify fragments or regions of the sequences of the invention which match a particular target sequence or target motif. The search can be a BLAST search or other routine sequence comparison, e.g., a search described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Thus, in one aspect, the invention features a method of analyzing 67108, e.g., analyzing structure, function, or relatedness to one or more other nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. The method includes: providing a 67108 nucleic acid or amino acid sequence; comparing the 67108 sequence with a second sequence, e.g., one or more preferably a plurality of sequences from a collection of sequences, e.g., a nucleic acid or protein sequence database to thereby analyze 67108. The method can be performed in a machine, e.g., a computer, or manually by a skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> The method can include evaluating the sequence identity between a 67108 sequence and a database sequence. The method can be performed by accessing the database at a second site, e.g., over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;target sequence&rdquo; can be any DNA or amino acid sequence of six or more nucleotides or two or more amino acids. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that the longer a target sequence is, the less likely a target sequence will be present as a random occurrence in the database. Typical sequence lengths of a target sequence are from about 10 to 100 amino acids or from about 30 to 300 nucleotide residues. However, it is well recognized that commercially important fragments, such as sequence fragments involved in gene expression and protein processing, may be of shorter length. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> Total RNA was prepared from various human tissues by a single step extraction method using RNA STAT-60 according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions (TelTest, Inc). Each RNA preparation was treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37&deg; C. for 1 hour. DNAse I treatment was determined to be complete if the sample required at least 38 PCR amplification cycles to reach a threshold level of fluorescence using &bgr;-2 microglobulin as an internal amplicon reference. The integrity of the RNA samples following DNase I treatment was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. After phenol extraction cDNA was prepared from the sample using the SUPERSCRIPT&trade; Choice System following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions (GibcoBRL). A negative control of RNA without reverse transcriptase was mock reverse transcribed for each RNA sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> Endogenous human 67108 gene expression was determined using the Perkin-Elmer/ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System which employs TaqMan technology. Briefly, TaqMan technology relies on standard RT-PCR with the addition of a third gene-specific oligonucleotide (referred to as a probe) which has a fluorescent dye coupled to its 5&prime; end (typically 6-FAM) and a quenching dye at the 3&prime; end (typically TAMRA). When the fluorescently tagged oligonucleotide is intact, the fluorescent signal from the 5&prime; dye is quenched. As PCR proceeds, the 5&prime; to 3&prime; nucleolytic activity of Taq polymerase digests the labeled primer, producing a free nucleotide labeled with 6-FAM, which is now detected as a fluorescent signal. The PCR cycle where fluorescence is first released and detected is directly proportional to the starting amount of the gene of interest in the test sample, thus providing a quantitative measure of the initial template concentration. Samples can be internally controlled by the addition of a second set of primers/probe specific for a housekeeping gene such as GAPDH which has been labeled with a different fluorophore on the 5&prime; end (typically VIC). The differential labeling of the target gene and internal reference gene thus enabled measurement in same well. Forward and reverse primers and the probes for both &bgr;2-microglobulin and target gene were added to the TaqMan&reg; Universal PCR Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems). Although the final concentration of primer and probe could vary, each was internally consistent within a given experiment. A typical experiment contained 200 nM of forward and reverse primers plus 100 nM probe for &bgr;-2 microglobulin and 600 nM forward and reverse primers plus 200 nM probe for the target gene. TaqMan matrix experiments were carried out on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: hold for 2 min at 50&deg; C. and 10 min at 95&deg; C., followed by two-step PCR for 40 cycles of 95&deg; C. for 15 sec followed by 60&deg; C. for 1 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> The following method was used to quantitatively calculate human 67108 gene expression in the various tissues relative to &bgr;-2 microglobulin expression in the same tissue. The threshold cycle (Ct) value is defined as the cycle at which a statistically significant increase in fluorescence is detected. A lower Ct value is indicative of a higher mRNA concentration. The Ct value of the human 67108 gene is normalized by subtracting the Ct value of the &bgr;-2 microglobulin gene to obtain a <highlight><subscript>&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct value using the following formula: <highlight><subscript>&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct&equals;Ct<highlight><subscript>human 59914 and 59921</subscript></highlight>&minus;Ct <highlight><subscript>&bgr;-2 microglobulin</subscript></highlight>. Expression is then calibrated against a cDNA sample showing a comparatively low level of expression of the human 67108 gene. The <highlight><subscript>&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct value for the calibrator sample is then subtracted from <highlight><subscript>&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct for each tissue sample according to the following formula: <highlight><subscript>&Dgr;&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct&equals;<highlight><subscript>&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct&minus;<highlight><subscript>sample</subscript></highlight>&minus;<highlight><subscript>&Dgr;</subscript></highlight>Ct&minus;<highlight><subscript>calibrator</subscript></highlight>. Relative expression is then calculated using the arithmetic formula given by 2<highlight><superscript>&minus;&Dgr;&Dgr;Ct</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> Tissues tested include the human cardiovascular tissues. 67108 mRNA was detected in aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC), adipose cells, normal carotid artery, normal muscular artery, diseased aorta and normal vein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. </paragraph>
