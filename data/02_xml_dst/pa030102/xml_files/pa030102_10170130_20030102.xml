<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A memory card with a tilt sensor is inserted into a personal digital assistant (PDA). When the PDA is tilted back and forth, the tilt sensor detects a tilt angle and outputs the tilt angle to an A/D converter. The A/D converter converts the tilt angle into digital data and supplies the digital data to a signal controller. The signal controller converts the format of the tilt data (digital data) into a communication format processable by the PDA in which the memory card is installed. The signal controller outputs the converted data to the PDA through an input/output interface. Accordingly, the PDA can control display of a game screen in accordance with the tilt data supplied from the memory card. A user who used to play the game using key input can now cause the PDA to function as a more interesting game machine. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to memory cards, personal digital assistants (hereinafter referred to as PDAs), information processing methods, recording media, and programs, and more particularly relates to a memory card which has a sensor, a vibrator, or a speaker and which records therein a game program, a personal digital assistant, an information processing method, a recording medium, and a program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Known memory cards based on flash memories can store, for example, music data, video data, computer program software, or other content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, a memory card storing a game program is installed in a PDA. As a result, the mere PDA functions as a game machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Even when the memory card storing the game program is installed in the PDA and the PDA functions as the game machine, the PDA cannot receive information other than that input by operating buttons, such as tilting of the game machine, or cannot output audio data (sound effects) and vibrations which are to be conveyed to a user in accordance with the progress of a game. As a result, the PDA lacks a game machine feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A sensor for inputting information such as tilting of the game machine, a vibrator for transferring a vibration, or a speaker for outputting sound can be mounted on the PDA. When the sensor or the vibrator, which is not generally used, is mounted on the PDA, increases in the cost and the size are caused unnecessarily. </paragraph>

The memory stick is produced by storing a flash memory device, which is one type of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), a non-volatile memory in which information can be electrically overwritten and erased, in a small-sized thin plastic casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is 50.0 mm (H)&times;21.5 mm (W)&times;2.8 mm (D). Various data such as images, audio data, and music data can be written to and read from the memory stick through a terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having ten pins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The memory stick employs a unique serial protocol that can assure compatibility with an apparatus using the memory stick in response to a change in the specification of the built-in flash memory in order to increase the capacity or the like. The memory stick accomplishes high-speed performance, i.e., a maximum write speed of 1.5 MB/s and a maximum read speed of 2.45 MB/s. An erroneous erase protection switch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for protecting recorded data from being erroneously erased is provided to ensure high reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The pins of the terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are numbered <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Specifically, pin numbers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (VSS) are grounded (GND); a serial protocol bus state signal is supplied to pin number <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (BS: Bus State); power supply voltage is supplied to pin numbers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (VCC); a serial protocol data signal is exchanged through pin number <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (SDIO: Serial Data In/Out); pin numbers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are kept in reserve; pin number <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (INS: Interrupted Status) is for detecting card insertion and removal; and a serial protocol clock signal is supplied to pin number <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described. In the first embodiment, a memory card having a tilt sensor will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the interior of a memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will be referred to as the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the tilt sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> converts parallel data into serial data and controls a storage unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in accordance with a serial interface protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The storage unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed by a memory for storing various data from an electronic apparatus such as a personal computer, a PDA, or a cellular phone in which the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is installed. For example, the memory has a storage capacity of a few MB to a few tens of MB. The memory can be formed by a RAM (Random Access Memory) type memory, to and from which information can be written and read, or a ROM (Read Only Memory) type memory, into which a dedicated program is stored in advance and which is then used as a read only memory. Alternatively, the memory can be formed by a combination of RAM and ROM. The storage unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the present invention is a memory for storing data such as a game program, and data concerning the progress status of a game (such as information indicating the number of stages cleared) can be written in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For example, when the storage unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed by a plurality of memories, the signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is designed to control each memory. For example, when the storage unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed by a plurality of memories of different types, the signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> accommodates characteristic differences among these memories, controls each memory, and performs error correction processing in accordance with error characteristics of each type of memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can perform processing in compliance with the serial interface protocol by the signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and hence the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is highly extensible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided at a location in the longitudinal direction of the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> detects a tilt angle when the electronic apparatus having the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is tilted back and forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is, for example, a variable-resistance sensor such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> outputs a resistance in accordance with a tilt angle. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> tension spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to a main body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a connection pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a tension spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to the main body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a connection pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The tension springs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to each other through a connection pin <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is placed horizontally, a movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is designed to be substantially at the center between the tension springs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the connection pin <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (that is, the movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> stands still at a balanced position). The movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is in contact with an electrode terminal rail <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (resistance is zero) and a resistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The resistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> outputs a resistance at a position at which the movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is in contact therewith through output terminals <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, when the B side of the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is tilted downward (A side is higher than B side), the force of gravity in accordance with the tilt acts on the movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is moved to the B side so that the tension spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can stretch and the tension spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can contract. Accordingly, the path of the resistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> becomes shorter compared with a case in which the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is placed horizontally. Thus, the resistance output through the output terminals <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes smaller than that output when the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is placed horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For example, when the A side of the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is tilted downward (B side is higher than A side), the force of gravity in accordance with the tilt acts on the movable contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The movable contract <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is moved to the A side so that the tension spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can contract and the tension spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can stretch. Accordingly, the path of the resistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> becomes longer compared with a case in which the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is placed horizontally. Thus, the resistance output through the output terminals <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes greater than that output when the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is placed horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an analog to digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> converts the resistance (tilt angle) output from the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> into digital data and supplies the digital data to the signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The digital data output from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be either serial data or parallel data. Since the signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is designed to perform processing in accordance with the serial interface protocol, the serial data is preferable. When the parallel data is output, the signal converter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> performs serial/parallel conversion processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> converts the format of the tilt data, which is detected by the tilt sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and which is converted into digital data by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, into a communication format processable by the electronic apparatus having the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The signal controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> outputs the converted tilt data to the electronic apparatus through an input/output (I/O) interface (I/F) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The I/O interface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to the electronic apparatus and inputs/outputs various data from/to the electronic apparatus. Among the ten pins of the terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, three pins, namely, pin number <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to which a serial protocol bus state signal is supplied, pin number <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, through which a serial protocol data signal is exchanged, and pin number <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to which a serial protocol clock signal is supplied, are used to transmit and receive the serial protocol bus state signal, the serial protocol data signal, and the serial protocol clock signal to/from the electronic apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The serial protocol clock signal and the serial protocol bus state signal are supplied from the electronic apparatus. Data is transmitted to and received from an external apparatus by bidirectional half-duplex transfer. When the memory card <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits/receives a control packet as data to/from the electronic apparatus, for example, the maximum frequency of the clock is set to 20 MHz, and data is transferred by adding an error check code on the basis of units of 512 bytes. </paragraph>
