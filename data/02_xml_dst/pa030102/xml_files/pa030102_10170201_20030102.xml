<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a plug portion for an optical plug connection according to the preamble of claim 1. Together, sleeve portions and plug portions of the type mentioned form an optical plug connection, in which light can be transmitted with as less transmission losses as possible. Therefore the sleeve portion can either centre a pair of plugs towards one another or it can align an one-side inserted plug with an optical element as e.g. a light receiver or a light transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For optical plug connections demands are always increasing. On the one hand, similar to electronical components, a continuous miniaturisation is demanded, nevertheless a manual handling still must be guaranteed. On the other hand this miniaturisation must not make the assembling more difficult and expensive, and for reasons of production, the plug connection should comprise as less component parts as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A comparable kind of a plug connection is known, for example, from the EP A 1 072 918. This meets all of today&apos;s demands, as e.g. tensile strong lock of the plug portion in the sleeve portion, the facing side of the connector pin being protected by a protecting cover, dipped insert openings and much more. However, in practise it has been shown, that the production and the assembling is still involved with a great effort and that depending on the purpose of use in particular the handling of the plug is difficult due to its small gripping surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For the enlargement of the gripping surface at duplex plug portions it is already known from the U.S. Pat. No. 5,579,425, to insert a clip between the both simplex plugs, which on the one hand connects the both simplex plugs with one another and which on the other hand comprises a flexible gripper part, which engages onto the both lever arms at the single plugs indirectly serving for the release. However the gripper element is not tightly connected to those lever arms, and furthermore the problem at the single plugs is not solved therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore it is an object of the present invention to create a plug portion of the type mentioned above, in order to produce an optical plug connection with a few components and little effort of assembling, which can be handled well in spite of the miniaturisation. This object is solved by a plug portion comprising the features of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The gripper part, being separately snappable onto the locking element, simplifies the handling of the plug portion considerably, and the effort of assembling is less. The separate gripper part can also additionally be used for the encoding of the plug portion, for example by the use of different colours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The locking element can be formed as a bent component made of metal and the gripper part made of plastic material. The gripper parts of different colours can be produced cheaply therewith by means of the injection moulding method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The gripper part can engage partly onto the locking element and can be anchored at lateral snap cams behind edges of the locking element. However, also push-bottom like snap connections would be conceivable. The engagement of the locking element is especially advantageous, if it itself is snapped onto the plug housing. In a snap connection with lateral opening snap legs, the gripper part serves for the securing of the snapped-on locking element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In this case, the locking element can for example be snapped onto the plug housing at lateral linkage cams, engaging in recesses at the locking element, the latter comprising two parallel arms, laterally extending along the plug housing, at which ends there are arranged detent pawls, which are able to engage at the undercuts of the sleeve portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore it is advantageous, if the locking element is provided integrally with a leaf spring, which is supported between the parallel arms, preferably in the region of the both detent pawls at the plug housing and thus preloads the detent pawls in the engaged position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A duplex plug unit can be formed most preferably in that at least two plug portions are associated with a connector in a position almost running in parallel next to each other and that a common gripper part is able to snap onto the locking elements of the both plug portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An optical connection can be formed with a prescribed plug portion and with a sleeve portion, said sleeve portion comprising a sleeve housing with at least one insert opening, which is closed by means of a pivotable protective flap, which is held in closed position by means of the power of a close spring, said protective flap being a bent component made of metal, that is flexibly latched at the sleeve housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The formation of the protective flap as a bent component made of metal that is flexibly latched at the sleeve housing, allows to omit the use of the hitherto usual axis in order to link the protective flap. Thereby not only a component is omitted which is difficult in handling, but also the assembling is substantially facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The protective flap can thereby be linked at a pivoting bearing, comprising a pair of linkage cams and hinge sockets. Thereby, the linkage cams can be arranged at lateral wings, that are bent towards the plane of the protective flap. The hinge sockets are advantageously formed by through openings in the sleeve housing. Thus also conventional protective flaps with separate axes can be linked at the same sleeve housing respectively these conventional protective flaps at existing sleeve portions can be exchanged for those according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further advantages can be achieved, if the close spring is a leaf spring formed integrally with the protective flap which is supported at the bottom of the sleeve housing. Thereby an additional coiled spring for enforcing the spring power is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> If the leaf spring is divided in two separate spring tongues at least in the region of the support, the desired spring power depending on the chosen width of the tongues can be set relatively fine. The stress-free leaf spring can thereby be inclined in an angle of 10&deg; to 20&deg;, preferably of about 15&deg;, towards the protective flap, said support being performed nearby the pivoting axis. Thus the leaf spring takes up a small amount of space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The prescribed sleeve portion with the latched protective flap could also be used for plug connectors with conventional plug portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Particularly preferred, the sleeve portion can be used by an additional means in an optical plug connection, which allows the inclusion of different categories of plug portions, at which a connector pin is retained in the plug housing, protruding over the facing side of the plug housing. For this purpose a bulging, which is directed against the interior of the sleeve housing, is provided in the protective flap in order to prevent a collision with the connector pin when the plug portion is inserted into the sleeve portion. For plug portions, the facing side of which is not protected by a protecting cover, it is thus prevented, that the facing side of the connector pin ascents on the protective flap before it is pivoted back. Thereby it is suitable when the bulging is wider than the diameter of the connector pin, but narrower than the facing side of the plug housing. The depth of the bulging is dimensioned in such a way that the facing side of the connector pin never gets in contact to the surface of the protective flap and the latter is pushed open by the facing side of the plug housing.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As it is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an optical plug connection, together referred to as <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, consists of at least one sleeve portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and at least one plug portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The shown sleeve portion is formed as a so-called middle piece, that can be fixed to a device wall e.g. by means of a fixing clip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being able to snap-on and that comprises an insert opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on both sides, in which a plug portion of the same kind can be inserted. Each insert opening or optionally also only one of them is closed by a protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which pivots back by the inserting power when the plug portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted and which releases the insert opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As it is shown from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sleeve portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of a sleeve housing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which advantageously comprises two identical housing halves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;. The housing halves are shaped hermaphroditic such that they can be put together at a bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or respectively at openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and for example can be adhered. Thus said both housing halves include a centring barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> floatingly mounted, in which the connector pins of the inserted plug portions become centred on one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; is mounted to be able to pivot around a pivoting axis <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Details of the configuration of the protective flap respectively of the linkage bearing are apparent from the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> respectively <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Each protective flap is formed as a bent component made of metal, the lateral bent wings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; both being provided with one linkage cam <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;. Thereby the linkage cams consist of a deformation of the material. Furthermore there is provided a leaf spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is inclined towards the plane of the protective flap at about 15&deg;. The leaf spring passes over into two separate spring tongues <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, which still only exert a slight spring action. In about the middle of the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> a deeply moulded bulging <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When inserting the protective flap in the sleeve housing, the both wings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; get a little bit pressed together in such a way that the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> gets bent up in its longitudinal direction. This position is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As soon as the linkage cams <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; have reached the step bearings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime;, they engage and thereby built the linking connection. Now the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is able to pivot around the pivoting axis <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the latched position the both spring tongues <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; are supported at the bottom <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the sleeve housing and press the protective flap in the closed position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Thereby a undercut <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> serves as a stop and is at the same time serving for the anchoring of the inserted plug portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A first category of a plug portion is shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The plug portion consists of a plug housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the facing side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of which is covered with a protecting cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> being able to both pivot and slide. Said protecting cover thereby covers up the connector pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> slightly protruding over the facing side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The protecting cover contains a pair of guide cams and linkage cams <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which are engaged in guide tracks <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the plug housing. The insertion is thereby performed by means of insert grooves <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The opening of the protecting cover is performed by a mechanical control at the insertion process into the sleeve portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The protecting cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preloaded into the closed position by a coiled spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is held in a hollow tappet <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. This one is slideable in a tappet guide <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on the plug housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> On the plug housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> a locking element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is snapped-on. For this there are provided lateral linkage cams <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> engaging into recesses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The locking element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises two lateral parallel arms <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, at which ends there are arranged bents <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. These serve as detent pawls engaging into the undercuts <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at the sleeve portion and thus locking the plug portion tensile strong. Thereby, the locking element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preloaded with a leaf spring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> into the locking position, which supports on the surface of the plug housing, namely approximately in the region of the both bents <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the withdrawn state lateral stops <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at the plug housing limit the final position of the locking element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For a better manual handling of the locking element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when a plug portion is mounted, a gripper part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided, which is snapped onto the locking element. Thereby, the gripper part is designed as ergonomic as possible and laterally overlaps the locking element such that a good stability is ensured. For the snap connection there are provided snap cams <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the inner side engaging behind edges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the locking element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The connector pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mounted with axial spring action inside the plug portion. Details of this can for example be taken from the EP A 1 072 918 mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> there are shown the movement processes being performed when a plug portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted into a sleeve portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> it is apparent that the first contact of the plug portion with the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> takes place at the outer side of the protecting cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Therefore, over the first some angular degrees, the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pivoted back by the protecting cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which at the same time begins to open. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a position, in which the protecting cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is partially opened and the further pivoting back of the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is performed at the facing side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the plug housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this inclined position of the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> the facing side of the connector pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is already spaced apart from the plane of the protective flap in a certain distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the final position of the plug portion is reached, in which the bents <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> engage at the undercuts <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The protecting cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pivoted open by 90&deg; and is retracted relatively to the facing side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the plug housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The connector pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> now penetrates inside the centring barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is now totally pivoted back and runs approximately in parallel to the bottom <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the sleeve housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> the insertion process for a second category of a plug portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is indicated, which plug housing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is not covered with a protecting cover at the facing side. Therefore the connector pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> protrudes unprotected over the facing side and would collide with the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the beginning of the insertion process. However this is prevented by the bulging <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, such that from the beginning the protective flap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is only in contact with the facing side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the plug housing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which is wider than the bulging <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Finally the FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> further show the possibility of an optical duplex plug connector. For this purpose, two plug portions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as described above, are connected with the aid of a connection clip <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to a duplex plug portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the connection clip can be laterally latched at a collar <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The plug portions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are held on distance in parallel towards each other, but they can still move slightly in different axes of space. Over the both locking elements <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a common double gripper part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is now snapped-on, such that in the end a common handling respectively release of the both plug portions is possible (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For such a duplex plug portion a special duplex sleeve portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided, which is however arranged similar to the sleeve portion according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As an alternative fixing form at a housing wall, a screwable fixing clip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is shown here. </paragraph>
