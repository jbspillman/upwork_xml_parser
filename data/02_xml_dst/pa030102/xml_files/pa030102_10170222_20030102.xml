<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to brushes for personal care, and more particularly to brushes incorporating a fluid dispenser. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Brushes of various kinds are used for purposes of hygiene and for aesthetic purposes. These include application of personal care products to the face, the hair and the nails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Brushes designed for use on the skin of the face are used to ensure thorough cleaning to remove surface oils and accumulated debris, and are frequently recommended for use in preventing blocked pores, blackheads, acne and similar skin eruptions. Brushing is carried out after application of an appropriate skin cleanser or medicated lotion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Individuals frequently need to clean beneath the fingernails. This is especially true in certain professions, in which either high levels of hygiene are required, such as the medical or catering professions, or in which the workers hands and nails are constantly brought into contact with dirt, such as gardening, garage work etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Simply washing the hands with water and detergent is not sufficient and the fingernails, and the area beneath the fingernails, which traps considerable amounts of dirt, must be cleaned separately. The simplest and most economical way to clean beneath the fingernails is by use of a detergent and suitably sized brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Brushes have a wide variety of uses in applying products to the hair, enabling even distribution of the product over not only the outer layers of the hair, but also the lower layers and the roots. Hair products which may be applied by use of a brush include dyes, medicated shampoos for prevention of dandruff and preparations for prevention of hair loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A small brush may also be used to apply polish remover to the fingernails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In all of the above applications, a fluid must be first placed on the brush before the treatment process can begin, which is time consuming. An excessive amount of fluid may be inadvertently transferred to the brush, making the process uneconomical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, a container for the fluid is required and is either stored with the brush, which is space-consuming and contributes to a cluttered appearance of the area in which the brush and fluid are stored, or is stored elsewhere, in which case it must be located when required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, conventional brushes are frequently uncomfortable to hold and manipulate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the case of the conventional brush and detergent method for cleaning the nails, an additional disadvantage is that frequent washing with standard detergents causes drying of the nails and the skin beneath the nails, which contributes to flaking and breaking of the nail, and to irritation of the skin of the fingertips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore it would be desirable to provide a simple and economical brush for automatic application of a fluid. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which illustrate a preferred embodiment of an automatic applicator brush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, constructed and operated in accordance with the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention, brush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a plurality of bristles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an ampoule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> containing a personal care fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be selected from a wide variety of products, such as liquid soap, facial cleanser, acne treatment fluid, shampoo, hair dye, nail varnish remover etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed wit a treaded hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on one side. Neck <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of ampoule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed with a complementary threaded opening, such that ampoule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be firmly screwed into housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An inlet device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned within housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, connecting to hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is allowed to flow into housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from ampoule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until a maximum level is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises a button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which activates a pump <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and ejection device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is depressed, fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is drawn into ejection device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by the action of pump <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Ejection device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is simultaneously pushed downwards and becomes inserted within nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from which fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is forced outwards onto the lower surface of housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and bristles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may then be applied to the appropriate skin, hair, or nail surface by appropriate brushing motions, which may, for instance, be circular motions in the case of skin surfaces, or stroke movements for application of fluid to the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Bristles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are of an appropriate length and material for the particular personal care process for which the brush is intended. A brush for use on the skin of the face will have relatively soft bristles, while a brush for use on the hair will contain stiffer, longer, bristles. Various combinations of bristle may be used in brushes intended for specific purposes. For example, an facial care brush may include one or more outer rows of stiff bristles for treatment of problem areas, combined with softer inner rows for even application of the applied fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of an automatic applicator brush. In this embodiment, bristles are arranged in a small number of rows concentric with the casing of the brush, while the central region is occupied by a sponge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Sponge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be regularly removed and replaced with a fresh sponge in order to maintain a high standard of hygiene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A further use of the automatic applicator brush is intended for application of fluids to the hair. These may include hair dyes, anti-dandruff preparations or preparations for the prevention of hair loss. In all of these products, it is desirable that application be uniform along the entire length of the hair shaft, including the roots. The brush comprises two or more sets of bristles of different lengths of enable parting of the hair and simultaneous application of the product to the outer layers of the hair and to the roots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to ampoule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be used directly from the bottle in which it is supplied (not shown). Inlet mechanism <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be used in conjunction with any standard, commercially available bottle or container by use of an appropriate detachable adaptor. A range of adaptors in various sizes is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of an adaptor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Adaptor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has one open threaded end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of dimensions appropriate for screwing into threaded hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a second open end suitable for attachment to the opening of a standard, commercial bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show an additional alternative embodiment <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of an automatic applicator brush, comprising an upper housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lower housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a plurality of bristles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a spring-loaded liquid dispenser <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a reservoir <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> containing fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Lower casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided with a central opening <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, beneath which sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Dispenser <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> comprises an upper section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a lower section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, connected by a compression spring <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Lower section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> comprises an essentially cylindrical body <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, tapering at its lower end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and ending in a narrow cylindrical structure <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which forms a stopper which fits into opening <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of lower casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, preventing fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from flowing out of reservoir <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A circular rim <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of diameter greater than that of body <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and equal to the inner diameter of reservoir <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is positioned on body <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> directly above tapering end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Upper dispenser section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> provided with an upper cap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which fits within an appropriate depression in upper housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When using device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is held in the palm of the hand with sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> positioned on the upper surface of the nail. Upon exertion of pressure on sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, stopper <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is pushed upwards, unsealing opening <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and allowing fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to flow out of reservoir <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> onto sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Upon cessation of pressure on sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, spring <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> serves to return lower dispenser section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, together with stopper <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to its position within opening <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, thus resealing reservoir <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> therefore serves to dispense fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and may be used to further rub fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> over a desired surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After dispensing of fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> onto the desired surface, the surface may be further scrubbed using bristles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As an example of use of device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, may be used with a cleanser <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in order to clean under the tips of fingernails. Device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned such that bristles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are inserted under the nail, and pressure exerted on sponge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> such that cleanser <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is dispensed as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Cleanser <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> comprises a herbal-based solution which is able to dissolve oils and other organic materials, thus assisting in removing dirt and other foreign debris from under the fingernails and from the surface of the fingernails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Cleanser <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> also contains an addition of vitamin E, which serves to protect and nourish the nails and skin. </paragraph>
