<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">To suppress oxidation of inner walls of element isolation grooves otherwise occurring during thermal oxidation processes. A nitrogen introducing layer less in diffusion coefficient relative to an oxidizing agent is formed at the surface portion of a silicon oxide film as buried within an element isolation groove. This nitrogen introduce layer functions as a barrier layer for precluding the oxidizer (such as oxygen, water or else) in vapor phase from diffusing into the silicon oxide film at thermal processing steps. The nitrogen introduce layer is formed by performing nitrogen ion implantation into an entire surface of a substrate and subsequently applying thermal processing to the substrate to thereby activate the nitrogen doped. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to semiconductor integrated circuit devices and fabrication technologies thereof and, more particularly to useful techniques for application to semiconductor integrated circuit devices having circuit element isolation grooves with a insulative film buried within a groove as formed in a semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With an increase in miniaturization or shrinkage of semiconductor devices for use as on-chip circuit elements, a new element isolation technique is employed in lieu of prior known local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) methods. This element isolation technique is the one that embeds or buries a silicon oxide film within a groove as formed in a semiconductor substrate to thereby form more than one element isolation groove, and is also known as the shallow trench isolation (STI) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To form the element isolation groove, the process starts with a step of applying thermal processing to the semiconductor substrate (simply referred to as &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; hereinafter) for fabrication of a thin silicon oxide film (also called pad oxide film) on or above its surface. This pad oxide film is formed for purposes of relaxation of stresses being applied to the substrate during baking for densification of the oxide silicon film buried within the groove at a later step and also protection of active regions during removal of a silicon nitride film that is used as a mask for oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Next, the process has a step to deposit a silicon nitride film at upper part of the pad oxide film by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques and then remove portions of the silicon nitride film which reside in element isolation regions by etching with a patterned photoresist film as a mask. This silicon nitride film is used as a mask during formation of a groove(s) through etching of the substrate along with a protective film for protection of its underlying substrate surface against oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Next, after having formed a groove in the substrate by dry etching with the silicon nitride film as a mask, the substrate is thermally oxidized to thereby fabricate a thin silicon oxide film on inner walls of the groove. This silicon oxide film is formed for purposes of removal of etch damages occurring at the groove inner walls and also stress relaxation of a silicon oxide film to be buried within the groove at a later step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, after having deposited by CVD method a silicon oxide film over the substrate to bury it within the groove, the substrate is thermally processed to thereby density this silicon oxide film. This densification is for improvements in film quality of the silicon oxide film as buried within the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Next, the process has a step to remove the silicon oxide film overlying the silicon nitride film by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques causing the silicon oxide film to remain within the groove, thus completing more than one element isolation groove. Thereafter, the silicon nitride film that has been used as the mask during formation of the groove in the substrate is removed by wet etch techniques, thus forming in active regions semiconductor circuit elements such as metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistors (MISFETs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, it has been pointed out that the element isolation groove as formed by the above-discussed methodology suffers from degradation in device characteristics. This can occur due to a mechanism which follows. At several thermal oxidation process steps during fabrication of semiconductor elements in active regions, oxidizing agents or oxidizers such as oxygen and water components in an atmosphere behave to invade the inside of an element isolation groove and then oxidize the inner walls thereof, resulting in formation of a silicon oxide film. Due to thermal volume expansion of such silicon oxide film, the active region is applied compressive stress force. This stress application can result in creation of unwanted crystal defects and/or dislocations at a portion of the substrate in the active region, causing the device characteristics to degrade. In view of the fact that the compressive stress being applied to the active region by oxidation of the isolation groove inner walls increases with a decrease in isolation groove width as resulted from a decrease in feature size of on-chip semiconductor devices, this problem is a serious bar to successful achievement of miniaturization or shrinkage of the semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another problem faced with the above-stated element isolation groove as has been reported until today is that a drain current can rush to flow even upon application of a low gate voltage. This is called the &ldquo;kink&rdquo; or &ldquo;hump&rdquo; characteristics among experts in the semiconductor device art. This problem occurs due to a mechanism which follows. The silicon oxide film buried in a groove is etched away through more than two hydrofluoric-acid cleaning process steps to be done during formation of a semiconductor circuit element in an active region, resulting in a portion of the silicon oxide film at an element isolation groove edge being retrograded or &ldquo;recessed&rdquo; downwardly, which in turn causes a gate insulating film as formed over a substrate surface portion of the active region to locally decrease in thickness. This local thinning of such gate insulating film leads to undesired drain current flow even upon application of a low gate voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One prior known approach to suppressing oxidation in the inner walls of element isolation grooves is to fabricate a thin silicon nitride film along the isolation groove inner walls in a way as taught, for example, from U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,884. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition, JP-A-2000-31267 discloses therein a remedy for formation of an unwanted groove at the outer periphery of an element isolation groove due to simultaneous etching of an oxidation-preventing silicon nitride film formed on isolation groove inner walls during removal by wet etching of a mask-use silicon nitride film as used for formation of grooves in a substrate, wherein the remedy employs a technique for increasing its etching rate by doping through ion implantation a chosen impurity into the silicon nitride mask to thereby damage it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> JP-A-2000-306990 discloses therein a remedy for preventing the silicon nitride film within an element isolation groove from being recessed due to unintentional etching during removal by wet etching of a pad oxide film as has been formed beneath the mask-use silicon nitride film, wherein the remedy makes use of a technique for applying thermal processing to the silicon oxide film within the isolation groove in a nitride gaseous atmosphere after having etched away the silicon nitride mask and yet prior to removal of the pad oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Considering from a different viewpoint from the problem stated above, JP-A-8-227938 discloses a remedy for precluding undesired etching of the silicon oxide film within an element isolation groove as a result of overlapping of a portion of a through-going hole with the isolation groove due to possible mask positioning/alignment deviation during formation of the through-hole deep enough to reach its underlying substrate by etching of a silicon oxide film as deposited over the substrate, by use of a technique for forming a silicon nitride film overlying the silicon oxide film within the isolation groove to thereby use this silicon nitride film as an etch stopper during formation of the through-hole. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In recent years, in the manufacture of a variety of types of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices including but not limited to complementary MOS (CMOS) devices with a plurality of types of MISFETs different in gate insulating film thickness from one another being formed on or over the same substrate, an increased number of hydrofluoric-acid cleaning and thermal oxidation process steps are required, which are to be effectuated at a stage between element isolation groove formation and fabrication of MISFETs. Due to this, with the related art methods stated supra, it becomes difficult to effectively suppress element isolation groove inner wall oxidation and/or silicon oxide film&apos;s retrogradation (recessing) at element isolation groove terminate end/edge portions, which would result in a decrease in reliability and mass-production yields of MOS devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a technique for effectively suppressing oxidation on inner walls of circuit element isolation grooves otherwise occurring during thermal oxidation processes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings below. Note that in all drawings for explanation of the embodiments, those having the same functions are designated by the same reference characters with any repetitive explanations thereof eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A complementary MISFET (CMOSFET) fabrication method in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention will be explained by use of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Initially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of p-type single-crystalline silicon having resistivity of 1 to 10 &OHgr; cm for example is subjected to thermal oxidation at approximately 850&deg; C. to thereby fabricate on its surface a thin silicon oxide film (pad oxide film) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a thickness of about 10 nm; thereafter to deposit by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a thickness of about 120 nm on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed for relaxation of any possible stress occurring at an interface between the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to thereby preclude creation of crystal defects such as dislocations or the like at the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> due to this stress. The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is for use as a mask during formation of more than one groove through selective etching of specified portions of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which reside in circuit element isolation regions. The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is hardly oxidizable in nature and thus is used also as a protective film for prevention of any unwanted oxidation at the surface of its underlying substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, selected portions of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the element isolation regions is subject to dry etching process with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as formed on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the active regions being used as a mask to thereby cause the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be exposed at its surface portions in the element isolation regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Next, after having removed the photoresist film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to apply dry etching to the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the element isolation regions, thereby forming grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to a depth of 350 nm as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Next, after completion of cleaning of the resultant exposed surface portions of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to inner walls of the grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by use of SC-1 liquid (mixture solution of ammonia water and hydrogen peroxide water), SC-2 (mixture of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide water) and hydrofluoric acid (or alternatively hydrofluoric-acid/ammonia-water mixture), the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally oxidized at about 800 to 900&deg; C. as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, thus forming on the inner walls of each groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>a thin silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with a thickness of about 10 nm. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed for recovery of dry etch damages occurring at the inner walls of groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while at the same time lessening or &ldquo;relaxing&rdquo; stress occurring at an interface between the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be later buried within the individual groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, CVD methods is used to deposit over the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to a thickness of about 450 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is completely buried within each groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in such a way that this film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is deposited by step coverage-excellent film fabrication methods such as CVD techniques with oxygen and tetraethoxysilane ((C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Si) used as source gases, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Next, after having thermally processed the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at about 900&deg; C. and densified the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to thereby make the film denser, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is dry-etched partway at its portions in the active regions with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is formed at upper part of the grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as a mask as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, thereby letting the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface height in the active regions to be substantially the same as that in the element isolation regions. It should be noted here that the densification of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may alternatively be done after effectuation of this dry etch process. If this is the case, it is possible to shorten the length of a time period as taken for densification. This can be said because the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is less in thickness than before dry etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, after the removal of the photoresist film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques is used to polish the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for planarization of its surface. This polishing is done while using as a stopper the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that covers the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the active regions and is terminated when the surface of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is exposed&mdash;that is, at a time point that the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface becomes coplanar with a surface of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within each groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (diagram enlargedly showing main part of a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), the surface of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within each groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is wet-etched using either hydrofluoric acid or hydrofluoric acid buffer solution (mixture liquid of hydrofluoric acid and ammonia water), thereby causing the surface of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to slightly retrograde or regress downwardly. Although this wet etching is not any essential process, in case a level difference between the surface of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is relatively large, nitrogen to be doped by ion implantation into silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the next step will possibly fail to reach a region deeper than the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface. Accordingly, in such a case, the above-noted wet etching is effectuated causing the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface to offer downward retrogradation to thereby lessen the level difference relative to the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, nitrogen is ion-implanted into an entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; subsequently, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally processed to activate the nitrogen doped whereby a nitrogen introduction layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed at a selected surface portion of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At this time it is desirable that a dose amount or &ldquo;dosage&rdquo; of nitrogen be set at 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> During ion implantation of nitrogen into the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the acceleration energy of nitrogen ions is controlled to ensure that a bottom portion of the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches a level lower than the surface of a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an active region while at the same time letting a thickness of from the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface to its bottom measure 10 nm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Additionally, upon introduction of nitrogen ions into the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the active region, an undesired energy level can be formed at an interface between the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gate insulating film of a MISFET to be later fabricated, resulting in a decrease in breakdown voltage of the gate insulating film and/or a variation in threshold voltage of the MISFET. Accordingly, in the event that the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is doped with nitrogen by ion implantation, the acceleration energy of nitrogen ions is appropriately controlled to prevent arrival of nitrogen ions at the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface after penetration of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as formed at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a structure similar to the so-called silicon oxynitride (SiON) with part of Si&mdash;O coupling or bonding for constitution of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being replaced by Si&mdash;N bond, which is featured in that the diffusion coefficient relative to oxidizers such as oxygen and/or water is noticeably less. More specifically the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is expected to function as a barrier layer for suppression of diffusion of an oxidizer in gas phase into the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> during thermal processing of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an oxidizing atmosphere, thereby suppressing oxidation of inner walls of the grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the above-noted nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> partially containing therein Si&mdash;N bonds is that an etching rate relative to hydrofluoric acid is lower than that of silicon oxides. In other words, the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may also function as a barrier layer for suppression of over-etching of the surface of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> while the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> undergoes wet cleaning by hydrofluoric acid or hydrofluoric acid buffer liquid, thereby suppressing recessing at element isolation groove end portions, wherein the recessing would pose a problem during the wet cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, using hot phosphoric acid the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that covers the portions of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the active regions is removed. With the processes up to here, circuit element isolation grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at its portions in element isolation regions. Note here that since the aforesaid nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that was formed at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as buried within each element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is such that a peak concentration point of the nitrogen doped by ion implantation is present at a deeper level than the surface, a ratio of Si&mdash;O bond is relatively high at locations adjacent to its surface whereas a ratio of Si&mdash;N bonds is relatively high in the inside thereof. Due to this, the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is little etched during etching of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by hot phosphoric acid; thus, as enlargedly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> stair-step like surface difference substantially equivalent to the thickness of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> takes place between a surface portion of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the individual active region and the surface of nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> immediately after removal of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Firstly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, after having formed grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by dry etching with a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a mask, thermal processing is applied to substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to thereby form a thin silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on inner walls of each groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The process steps up to here are similar in principle to those of the previous embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, CVD technique is used to deposit a thin silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> over the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a thickness of about 5 to 10 nm. Subsequently as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, after having buried a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within the groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by use of a method similar to that of the embodiment 1 and then planarized its surface, fabricate a nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Its following process is similar to that of the embodiment 1 stated supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In this way, with the embodiment 3, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed along inner walls of element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while forming the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as buried within element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; thus, it is possible to effectively suppress oxidation of the inner walls of element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during thermal oxidation processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> A fabrication method in accordance with a fourth embodiment will next be explained using FIGS. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, after having formed grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by dry etch techniques with a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a mask, substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally processed to thereby form a thin silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on inner surfaces&mdash;namely a bottom surface and sidewalls&mdash;of each groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The process up to here is similar to that of the previous embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35, a</cross-reference> nitrogen containing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fabricated on the bottom surface and sidewalls of groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This nitrogen containing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is manufacturable by a method having the steps of thermally processing the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an environment of a mixture of NO and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gases&mdash;here, 10% of NO contained&mdash;at temperatures ranging for example from 900 to 950&deg; C., and then forcing segregation of nitrogen into the bottom face and sidewalls of groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Alternatively the nitrogen containing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed through thermal processing of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O gaseous atmosphere at 1000 to 1050&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, after having buried a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within the groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by using a similar method to that of the previous embodiment 1 followed by planarization of the surface thereof, a nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed at a surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Although the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is capable of being formed by the above-noted ion implantation technique, the same results are obtainable by another method including the step of exposing the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a high-density nitrogen plasma atmosphere. Still another approach is to employ a method having the steps of performing this nitrogen plasma processing and thereafter thermally processing substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for causing outdiffusion of nitrogen within silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to thereby adjust a depth of nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and/or a profile of nitrogen doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In this way, with the embodiment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the nitrogen containing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed on the bottom and sidewalls of element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while simultaneously forming the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as buried within element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This nitrogen containing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is expected to function along with nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as a barrier layer for suppression of diffusion of an oxidizer used; thus, it becomes possible to effectively suppress oxidation of the inner surfaces of element isolation groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during thermal oxidation processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 5: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> A fabrication method in accordance with a fifth embodiment will be discussed using FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Firstly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, after having formed grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by dry etching with silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a mask, CMP processing is performed to planarize a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> deposited over substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The process steps up to here is the same as those of the previous embodiment 1 shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38, a</cross-reference> selected portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an area for formation of a thick gate insulating film(s) is coated with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>; then, doped by ion implantation nitrogen into substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in another area for fabrication of a thin gate insulating film(s). At this time, the acceleration energy of nitrogen ions is controlled to ensure that nitrogen ions pass through silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to reach surface portions of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in active regions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, after having removed the photoresist film <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally processed for activation of the doped nitrogen to thereby form a nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as buried within groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the thin gate insulating film formation area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Next, after having performed necessary processing including removal of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and formation of wells (p- and n-type wells <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) in accordance with the process steps of the embodiment 1 as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally processed at about 800&deg; C. to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for use as a gate insulating film with a thickness of about 10 nm on the surface of a respective one of the p- and n-type wells <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the thick gate insulating film formation area as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. Although at this time respective surfaces of p- and n-type wells <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the thin gate insulating film formation area are also oxidized, oxidation rates stay lower due to the fact that these surfaces have been doped with nitrogen. The result is that a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> made of silicon oxide (with a thickness of 5 to 6 nm for example) which is thinner than the above-stated gate insulating film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed on this surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Thereafter as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, n-channel MISFETs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and p-channel MISFETs Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed in accordance with the processes of the previous embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In this way, with the embodiment 5, two types of gate insulating films <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> different in thickness from each other are formed substantially simultaneously at a single thermal oxidation step; thus, it is possible to shorten the CMOS device fabrication process. Additionally, the requisite number of thermal oxidation and hydrofluoric acid cleaning steps is reduced, thus enabling suppression of oxidation of inner walls of element isolation grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and/or recessing of the substrate at active region edges without requiring formation of nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at element isolation grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the thick gate insulating film fabrication area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Optionally it is also possible to form the two types of thickness different gate insulating films <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> simultaneously at a single thermal oxidation process step by a method which includes the steps of covering the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a photoresist film in the thick gate insulating film fabrication area after having formed the p-and n-type wells <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the process of the previous embodiment 1 shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by way of example and then selectively doping nitrogen by ion implantation into substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the thin gate insulating film formation area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 6: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A sixth embodiment will be discussed using FIGS. <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Initially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, after having formed grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by dry etch techniques with silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a mask, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> deposited over substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is planarized by CMP methods. Then, surface portions of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> residing within the grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is wet-etched by hydrofluoric acid-based etchant, causing the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface to little retrograde downwardly. The process steps up to here are the same as those of the above embodiment 1 shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, after having ion-implanted nitrogen into an entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>, silicon (Si) is ion-implanted into the entire surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>. Note here that these nitrogen and silicon ion implantation steps are freely determinable in order of sequence on a case-by-case basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Next as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally processed, forming a nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Performing this thermal processing results in creation of silicon oxynitride (SiON) at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by replacement of part of Si&mdash;O bonds making up silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with Si&mdash;N bonds and simultaneously production of Si&mdash;N bonds through reaction of the nitrogen and silicon as introduced by ion implantation. Its following process steps are the same as those of the prescribed Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In this way, with the embodiment <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, both nitrogen and silicon are ion-implanted into the surface portion of each portion of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as buried in the individual groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and are then forced to react together by thermal processing applied thereto. With such process scheme, it is possible to readily fabricate the intended nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> high in Si&mdash;N bond concentration when compared to the case where nitrogen alone is doped into silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> because of the fact that the coupling energy of nitrogen and silicon is lower than an energy for replacement of Si&mdash;O bonds with Si&mdash;N bonds; thus, it becomes possible to more effectively suppress oxidation of inner walls of grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and recessing of active region edge portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Note here that the nitrogen introduction or doping may alternatively be achievable by use of the previously stated nitrogen plasma method other than ion implantation methods. More specifically the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be formed by a process having the steps of exposing the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a nitrogen plasma atmosphere after or prior to execution of ion implantation of silicon into an entire surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and thereafter applying thermal processing to substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Still alternatively the nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be fabricated by utilization of a thermal oxidation process after introduction of silicon and nitride into silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An example of this approach is as follows: after having ion-implanted silicon and nitride into the entire surface of substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>, hot phosphoric acid is used to remove silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, and thereafter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thermally processed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> to thereby form nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the surface portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this case, it is also possible to reduce the requisite nitrogen doping amount and/or eliminate nitrogen doping process per se since the oxidizer in an atmosphere diffusing into silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> during thermal processing is consumed through reaction with silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the method as has been discussed in conjunction with the embodiment 2 is employable to lower the nitrogen concentration of nitrogen introduce layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at portions adjacent to the active regions in the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with or without use of the method as stated in relation to any one of the embodiments 3 and 4 stated supra to form either the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or the nitrogen containing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> along inner walls of element isolation grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Although the invention made by the inventor(s) as named herein has been described in detail based on several embodiments thereof, this invention should not be limited only to these embodiments and may be modifiable and alterable in a variety of ways without departing the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> For example, a plurality of nitrogen introduce layers may be formed within a silicon oxide film by a process having the steps of performing ion implantation while varying the acceleration energy during ion implantation of nitrogen into the silicon oxide film within an element isolation groove(s) and thereafter performing thermal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The thermal processing for formation of the nitrogen introduce layer will not necessarily be performed immediately after introduction of nitrogen into the silicon oxide film within the element isolation groove(s) and may alternatively be done by utilizing thermal processing to be later effectuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiments stated above are specifically directed to CMOS device applications, the principles of the invention as disclosed and claimed herein may also be applied to other types of MOS devices having a plurality of thickness different gate insulating films, including but not limited to flash memories, memory-embedded logic devices, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> A brief explanation of effects and advantages obtainable by the representative ones of the invention as disclosed herein is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> By introducing nitrogen into a surface portion of a silicon oxide film as buried in an element isolation groove, it becomes possible to effectively suppress unwanted oxidation of inner walls of the element isolation groove otherwise occurring during thermal oxidation processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Introducing nitrogen into the surface portion of a silicon oxide film as buried within an element isolation groove makes it possible to effectively suppress recessing of the element isolation groove occurring at hydrofluoric acid cleaning steps. </paragraph>
