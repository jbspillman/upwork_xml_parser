<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">When a clearance between a rotor and the free end of a brush seal of thin plates becomes larger by oscillation of the rotor or the like, the enlarged clearance is effectively sealed. In order to achieve this effect, in a brush seal device, brush seal units as recess layers and brush seal units as projection layers are stacked in the direction of the pressure of the sealed fluid to form recess and projection portion on its free end. The inner diameter of the recess layer is different from that of the projection layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a brush seal device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a brush seal device having a brush seal mounted on one of two components displaceable relatively between the two components, wherein the brush seal is capable of resiliently deforming to follow the change of the clearance between the two components even if the relative change between the two components occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As one related to the present invention there exists a brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a sectional view of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mounted between a rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a casing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through which the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> passes. The casing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a component disposed on the stationary side of a steam turbine or gas turbine. The brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is mounted to the casing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to seal fluid by separating the space between the casing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed in a ring shape and attached to a channel section <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the casing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Main components of the brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are a brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, a backing plate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a holding plate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, a number of bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are arranged around the circumference to form a partition wall, and on end of the bristles are coupled together to form an attachment section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as the other end of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> faces the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the bristle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> generally used is 0.02 to 0.5 mm. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of bristles are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An annular backing plate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is located on one side face of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> with its side face <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> contacting the one side face of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and supports the bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against pressure action of the sealed fluid. A support plate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> formed as a ring plate is disposed on the other side face of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to sandwich, in cooperation with the backing plate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on its attachment section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> side. The brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is exposed at its free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> so that the side surface of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is not wholly sandwiched. One ends of the backing plate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the attachment section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, and the support plate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are welded together to form a connecting section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is a partial front view of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is in a state that the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are normally fitted without oscillation, such that a number of bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> extend straight and oriented to incline relative to the radial direction of the circumefrence of the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the normal state of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in contact with or close to the free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, as shown by the solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the free end side of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is precisely processed by wire electronic discharging or the like such that the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> fits the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> after the process. The bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are however apt to be deformed, so it is extremely difficult to process them. Moreover, it is also difficult to precisely process the free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is another related art to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows thin plates as seals <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> that are piled in the direction of a circumference of a rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and seal a high pressure area P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a low pressure area P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Outer circumference portion of the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is brazed and formed on an attachment section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as well as attached to the channel section of the casing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the brazed attachment section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Also, a backing plate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is located at a side face of the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in a low pressure area P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a holding plate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is located at a side face in a high pressure area P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and both the plates <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> support both sides of the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, respectively. However, when the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> eccentrically presses to contact the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> formed in the above way, the piled seals <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> forming an annular body have no space for compensation and thus the spring constant corresponding to the resilient deformation is increased, and thus it is difficult to follow the eccentric behavior of the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, clearance between the seals <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and the outer circumference surface of the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is large, and it causes a problem relating to sealing ability for sealed fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the pressure of the sealed fluid acts on the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in the direction of the surfaces of the piled thin plates forming the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and, as the result, gaps are forcedly increased between the piled plates. Accordingly, also in this case, a problem concerning to the capability to prevent the leakage of fluid to be sealed is present. Moreover, the brush seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> forming an annular body includes some hundreds of thousands thin plates used. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to fabricate the brush seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Further, as the length along the outer circumference of the annular body of the brush seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is longer than that along the inner circumference, spacers are necessarily disposed between thin plates on the outer circumference. However, gaps still remain between the surfaces of the piled plates. In this viewpoint, there also exists the problem of sealing ability. Also, in this constitution such that the flexibility thereof may be reduced, the free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> be worn quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the brush seal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A constituted as described above, when the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contacts the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> involved in any oscillation, oscillation or the like, the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is pressed to contact the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and at he same time its tilt angle is increased, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. If the pressure of the sealed fluid is the higher P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in this state, the differential pressure (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) between the P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the low pressure P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is increased, and the whole straight bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are pressed against the backing plate and become less deflective, and thus the ability to follow the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is worsened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> is a front view of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, viewed from the free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> at inner side. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, if the sealed fluid flows into gaps between straight bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, each bristle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, seen from the inner circumference side is pushed aside such that gaps between the bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are increased as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, and then the sealed fluid leaks from those separated clearances. If this operation is combined with a condition that the bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the inclined condition are separated by pressure, one separated side tends to displace such that the inclined angle is decreased, whereby the bristles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is deformed such that its length in the radial direction is large, and therefore it increases pressure to the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and causes wear. In addition to a condition like this, with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, compared to a position of the brush seal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> pressed to the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (in the condition of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>), in the opposite side to the radial direction from axis, a clearance C between a free side surface <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> swings as shown in imaginary lines in the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and opens widely, causing leakage of the sealed fluid from the clearance C. Also, with respect to a seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, because thin plates are attached in the direction to which the sealed fluid affects, attached surfaces of the thin plates are separated in the same way as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> if the sealed fluid affects, so that the sealed fluid leaks. In addition, because flexibility of the free end <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the seal <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is inhibited, distance from the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> should be large, and it causes a problem to the sealing ability and quickens wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in consideration of the problems as mentioned above, and the technical task is to increase the sealing ability even if a clearance is formed between a casing and a rotor by a brush seal. Also, it is another object to improve the resilient deformation of the brush seal in response to the pressure of the rotary shaft, so that abrasion of the brush seal by the rotary shaft is decreased. In addition, it is yet another object to obtain good ability of the brush seal to follow in response to the relative displacement between the brush seal and the outer circumference of the rotary shaft to improve the sealing ability. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve the problems as mentioned above, and a technical means for solving the problems is constituted as below. A brush seal of a preferred embodiment according to the present invention is a brush seal device, mounted on one of two components that are relatively rotated, for sealing the clearance given between the two components, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> a brush seal having stacked brush seal units, each brush seal unit comprising: a brush section formed by forming slits in a thin plate at the side opposite to the other component; an attachment section as a base part that is fixed to the one component at the opposite side of the thin plate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> wherein the brush seal is a lamination of the brush seal units as recess layers that has at its free end recesses and the brush seal units as projection layers that has at its free end projections and are stacked in the direction of the pressure of sealed fluid; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> wherein the inner diameter of the projection is different from that of the recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the brush seal device of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of brush seal units having a free end facing the surface of the mating component are formed such that each of the thin plates are formed into strips on one side thereof. One is formed with recess layer having larger inner diameter and the other formed with projection layer having smaller inner diameter. Those brush seal units having different diameters are laminated each other to form recess and projection portions on the free end, so that the free end can be flexibly deformed to fit closer to the opposing surface. In addition, because the recess and projection portion controls the sealed fluid even if a rotor is moved by oscillation such that the free end and the opposing surface of the other component is separated apart, enlargement loss of fluid flowing between the recess and projection portion and loss of thermal dynamic as well as viscous drag are added, so that fluid body resistance is increased such that the amount of leakage of the sealed fluid can be made less. Moreover, since a brush seal of relative arts is made up of hundreds of thousands of bristles, its inner circumference surface should be precisely processed by wire electric discharging or the like to form accurate circle, the free end of the present invention does not have to be precisely processed because the recess and projection portion increases fluid resistance to cause sealing effect even if a distance between the free end of the brush seal and the other part is increased. This enables an advantage of reduction of manufacturing cost. In addition, when the rotor as the other component oscillates and presses the brush seal, a clearance C (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) is formed at a side symmetrical to the pressed point. However, the recess and projection portion formed in the free end of the brush seal increases fluid resistance, so that sealing effect is increased. Thus, an excellent sealing effect to the oscillating rotor is obtained. Besides, because the attachment section side of the brush seals is integrated in one body such that base parts of the thin plates without strips formed are stacked, and this structure allows to form the attachment section by simply piling the brush seals, it is much easier to form the attachment section than to form attachment sections by welding hundreds of thousands of bristles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of brush seal devices of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings in detail. The drawings herein are design drawings showing shapes according to precise dimensions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a preferred embodiment, in which a clearance between a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of a gas turbine, is divided into a high pressure P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side and a low pressure P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a brush seal device. A fixing section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the outer circumference side of the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to a step <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> located in an inner circumference surface of the casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as one of two components, through a snap ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The fixing section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be attached to a channel section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> formed by a combination structure. A free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the inner circumference side of the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> contacts the opposite outer circumference surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as the other component, or is located closer to the surface. Thus, the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> seals fluid to be sealed at the high pressure P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mainly composed of a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> only, and a backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are accessories. Since the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is constituted by laminated thin plates, the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> alone can seal without disposing the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or the holding plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is processed to have slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> slanting toward the rotational direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at the inner circumference side of the thin plates of an annular shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, such that it forms strips. By forming slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, its inner circumference plate section constitutes a brush seal section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while a base part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the outer circumference plate section constitutes an attachment section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The brush section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by forming the inner diameter side of an annular thin plate into small strips to constitute a brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with its cross section in the rectangular shape. A plurality of brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P (also, referred to brush seal unit plate) are located in lamination state toward the axial direction of the rotor (rotary shaft) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to form a wall-like shape. Their outer circumference end portions are welded together to form an integrated attachment section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of integrated brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P laminated in the direction of pressure action of the sealed fluid. The laminated brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P have recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed by alternately laminating a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B having different inner diameters each other. The number of the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B may be one each, or may be a plural of the recess layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and the projection layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B laminated alternately. The number is set, considering the sealing effect according to the width of the recess and projection portion. The recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed in projection or recess with respect to a parallel line to the outer circumference surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, but the recess and projection portion may be formed into a step shape in which diameters increase gradually as a layer is closer to the low pressure P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side. Also, an embodiment of the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A forming brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P having smaller inner diameter toward the low pressure and laminated such that the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A has a step cross section, and also there is a brush seal of an embodiment in which the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is adopted to the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described above has slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> forming triangular spaces at the inner circumference side of a base part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of thin plates forming a ring shape, and a cross section of a brush part is angular (rectangular or square), and length of a side of the cross section is (0.005&minus;0.5)&times;(0.005&minus;0.5)mm, preferably (0.008&minus;0.20)mm&times;(0.018&minus;0.2)mm. Its length is within 5-50 mm. The thickness of the wall is determined as 0.01-0.4 mm or 0.4-5 mm; however, it may be determined depending on the pressure of the sealed fluid. Materials of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be steel, stainless steel, nickel-base alloy, ceramic, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a second embodiment according to the present invention. A plurality of the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P are laminated to form a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the amount of the pressure of the sealed fluid. The inner circumference side of the thin plates forming an annular shape is processed to form the slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by etching, pressing, electric discharging or the like, such that the brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P has a brush section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the strip like shape. Its outer circumference side is formed into a base part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the thin plate without slits as a unit such that the brush section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will not be removed. Each slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed as a triangular space with narrow inner circumference side. The slit may be formed in a parallel space if necessary. The slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> forms a brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> slanting toward the rotational direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the tilt angle of the brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is determined, depending on the rotor (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) speed or the like. The brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be formed in the rotating direction for both of the forward or reverse rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a fixing section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A for supporting an attachment section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a supporting surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for supporting such that the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will not be excessively bent by pressure of the sealed fluid. The supporting surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be contacted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the supporting surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be separated with a space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> contacts the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oscillates to a large extent, but, as the brush section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is composed of each brush part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which fine cross section is an angular shape, spring constant is small, and it follows resiliently to the oscillation of the rotor even if it contacts the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, so that abrasion is prevented. Thus, the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be resiliently deformed in response to the oscillation of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> even if it contacts the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. That is, contact can be absorbed depending on the spring constant set to the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oscillates. In addition, the brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> whose cross section is an angular shape further decreases the contacting pressure even if the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oscillates and contacts more, so that abrasion is further prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An attachment section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is welded together with the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a holding plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The weld area of the three parts forms a fixing portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed into a ring shape with smaller width in diameter direction than that of the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the length of the holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is that of the fixing portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but its length may be set close to that of the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in diameter direction. In this case of the long holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a space in which the sealed fluid can flow is formed between the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a side face of the holding plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> alone may be attached to the casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> without provision of the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the holding plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The reason is that the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of thin plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Material for the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably selected according to the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, it is produced using a nickel-base alloy, iron, steel, stainless, or other non-ferrous metal. Various kinds of material can be selected depending on the kind, temperature of the sealed fluid or other conditions in application fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a partial plan view of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, viewed from the inner diameter side. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the portion C, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> shows the third embodiment of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is comprised of brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P laminated in eight layers. As shown in enlarged view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> cross section of a brush part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed in a square shape which are arranged such that slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will not be in a row in the direction of pressure action of the sealed fluid. By arranging like this, leakage of the sealed fluid is prevented, thereby to improve the sealing ability. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, each layer of brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is comprised of two brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P having the same inner diameter and alternately located to form a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a partial sectional view of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the fourth embodiment of the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is comprised of five brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P laminated to form a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and the same number of brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P laminated to form a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, which are alternately laminated to form nine layers in total. Also, a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed in the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a various kinds of recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed, depending on the number of lamination layers of the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, the number of lamination layers of the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, and the number of layers of each layers of the recess layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and the projection layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B. The width of the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is determined, depending on the pressure of the sealed fluid or the like. A cross section of the brush part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is usually formed in a square shape. When a rectangular shape is used, a side in the pressurized direction of the sealed fluid is longer than that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, and the slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are alternately located such that they are not in a row in the pressurized direction of the sealed fluid. The arrangement of the brush parts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with this kind of cross sectional shape increases sealing ability and resilient deformation capacity of the brush parts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P with slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at one side of thin plates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows the fifth embodiment of a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P for a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of a brush part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P is formed in S-shape, and a portion closer to a free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed as a straight beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The spring constant of the brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P can be smaller than that of the brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In addition, the straight beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to rotate in forward or reverse direction. That is, rotation may not have to be one way, and it can be used when the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> rotates in forward or reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A plurality of the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> are laminated to form a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, and a plurality of the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are laminated to form a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, and then the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B are alternately laminated to form a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. With similar laminating conditions, a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A may be constituted by the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, and the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B may be constituted by the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> to form a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, the ability to follow in a pressed condition when a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oscillates or vibrates is increased so that abrasion of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be prevented. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows the sixth embodiment of a brush seal device according to the present invention. On the contrary, a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A may be constituted by the brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, and the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B may be constituted by the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> to form a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, it can be used when the rotor rotates in forward or reverse direction. In addition, a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A may be constituted by a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P composed of thin plates without a slit or by a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P that slits are formed in the inner circumference side at every quarter, sixth or eighth of the circle, or the like. Since this kind of recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A has few slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or no slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A increases sealing ability even if a lot of large slits are formed in a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this way, brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, or brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> can be arbitrarily laminated to form a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on a free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> appropriate for operating condition of a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be constituted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a plan view of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> showing the seventh embodiment according to the present invention. The brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P is composed of four brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having arc shape whose division surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are combined each other to form an annular shape as a whole. For the brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are formed in the inner circumference surface of an arc-shaped thin plate to form the brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. By arranging the brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that their division surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are not on one surface while laminating the brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, adjacent brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> fill spaces between the division surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, whereby leakage of sealed fluid from the division surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The constitution of the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which this kind of brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are combined is very effective in view of both the cost and assembly when manufacturing the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having large diameter. A recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is constituted by a plural of brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P which are the brush seal division pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> combined to form annual shape, and a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B is constituted by a plural of brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P having different inner diameter, and the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B are alternately laminated to form a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. By doing like this, any size of brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be easily produced from the thin plate having a small area regardless of the diameter of a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Next, still another embodiment according to the present invention will be described. The preferred second embodiment of a brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention comprises a backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having a support surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is combined with an attachment section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to support a side face of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; and a holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which supports the attachment section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment, even if a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oscillates to form a clearance between a free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and an opposing surface of at the other side, a recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supported by a backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> controls the flow of sealed fluid such that enlargement loss and thermodynamic loss of the fluid flowing between the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are added to viscous drag, and fluid resistance to the fluid flowing through the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is increased, so that the advantage of decreasing leakage of the sealed fluid is obtained. Moreover, since the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supported by the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and holding section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from both side and also supported by the backing plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> against pressure action of the sealed fluid, the shape of the recess and projection portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be maintained to obtain labyrinth effect even if the pressure of the sealed fluid is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment of the present invention comprises a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P forming a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A which has slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> slanted in the moving direction of the other part and also comprises a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P forming a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B which has S-shaped slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or S-shaped free end sides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed as straight beams <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in radial direction. In the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment, the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B is located in the proximate of the other part, for example, the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B are formed S-shaped, so that a brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed by the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to reduce the pressed force when the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oscillates and presses to a free end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, wear of the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> caused by the friction against the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be prevented. In addition, since the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is formed as the slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are slanted, the spring constant of the S-shaped brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be smaller than that of the slanted brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and elastically deformed in the direction of a diameter, and the slanted brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be complexly supported. Thus, the brush section can receive the action force complexly with the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A slanting in a direction, the complex resilient force allows the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to follow the press of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by complex oscillation. This enables to effectively perform sealing effect against oscillation force of the rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In addition, combination of slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> whose directions are not the same closes the clearances between slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, so that sealing effect is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention is that the slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of each brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P crossed in the laminated direction. In the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the fourth embodiment, slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P crosses in the piling direction, so that brush parts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> adjacent to each other closes the clearances between each slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereby sealed fluid can be effectively sealed by the brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> deforming like a plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention comprises a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P forming a projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B which has slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> slanted in the moving direction of the other part and that the a brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P forming a recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is formed as a thin plate without a slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or as a thin plate which the width of the brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is larger than that of the brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B. In the brush seal device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the fifth embodiment, since the slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B are slanted in the rotational direction of a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, for example, they can elastically follow in the rotational direction of a rotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Thus, wear caused by friction is prevented. In addition, because the brush seal unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P forming the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B is formed as a brush seal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that the clearance between slits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are large, that is, width of the brush section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is large, clearances between the part at one side and the other part at the other side are securely sealed with the sealed fluid by the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A. Thus, in addition to the elastic following-up characteristic by the projection layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, excellent effect of sealing the sealed fluid by the recess layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Since a brush seal device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises brush seal units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>P laminated alternately to form a recess and projection portion in a free end, in addition to viscous drag, enlargement loss and thermo dynamic loss of flow are added to the fluid flowing through the recess and projection surface which increases fluid resistance. Thus, sealing effect is enabled even in the presence of clearance between a free end of the brush seal and an outer circumference surface of a rotor. Since the both sides of a free end of the projection layer of a brush seal are formed as recess layers, elastic deformation is enabled, and a free end can be fit closer to an opposite surface of the other side. In addition, since the both sides of a free end of the projection layer of a brush seal are formed to recess surface, flexibility is added whereby the free end can be located closer to a rotor, and the advantage of increasing sealing effect between the free end and the rotor can be obtained. </paragraph>
