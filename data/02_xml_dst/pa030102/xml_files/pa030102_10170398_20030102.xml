<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to an auxiliary-driving system in an engine, which is adapted to drive auxiliaries supported on an engine body by a crankshaft of the engine body through a driving mechanism comprising pulleys and a transmitting belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is a conventionally known auxiliary-driving system in an engine for driving an automobile or the like, in which an endless belt is reeved, on one side of an engine body in a direction perpendicular to a crankshaft, around a crank pulley fixed to a crankshaft, a plurality of auxiliary pulleys for driving auxiliaries supported on the engine body and a tensioner, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the conventionally known system suffers from a problem that the tensioner is disposed at a vertically intermediate portion of the endless transmitting belt, and further, at a location closer to the engine body. Hence, it is difficult to conduct the adjustment of the tensioner and to perform other necessary maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The conventionally known system also suffers from another problem in that it is difficult to ensure a large reeving angle of the transmitting belt with respect to the auxiliary pulleys; and hence, a transmitting belt having a large width and a large tension is required, thereby resulting in an increase in size of the auxiliary-driving system and a deterioration of mileage. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new auxiliary-driving system in an engine, wherein an idler pulley having a tensioner function is located on an uppermost portion of a transmitting belt, thereby facilitating the adjustment of the tension of the transmitting belt and other maintenance; and both reeving angle of an inner surface of the belt with respect to an auxiliary pulley and reeving angle of an outer surface of the belt with respect to an auxiliary pulley can be ensured as large as possible, thereby enhancing the transmitting efficiency of the transmitting belt; and compactness of the auxiliary-driving system itself and reduction in cost thereof can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided an auxiliary-driving system in an engine, adapted to drive auxiliaries supported on an engine body by a crankshaft of the engine body, comprising: a crank pulley, a first auxiliary pulley and an idler pulley having a tensioner function, which are disposed in a triangular configuration with the idler pulley located in an uppermost position, on one side of the engine body in a direction perpendicular to the crankshaft; a second auxiliary pulley disposed in a space surrounded by these pulleys, and an endless transmitting belt reeved around the crank pulley, the idler pulley, the first auxiliary pulley and the second auxiliary pulley; an inner surface of the transmitting belt being reeved around the first auxiliary pulley, and an outer surface of the transmitting belt being reeved around the second auxiliary pulley. With this arrangement, both the reeving angles of the inner surface and outer surface of the transmitting belt with respect to the first and second auxiliary pulleys can be determined to be large, whereby the width and tension of the transmitting belt can be decreased to achieve compactness of the auxiliary-driving system and improvement in mileage. In addition, the adjustment of the tension of the transmitting belt and other maintenance can be carried out easily, because the idler pulley having the tensioner function is located at the uppermost portion of the auxiliary-driving system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, according to a second feature of the present invention, in addition to the arrangement of the first feature, the second auxiliary driven by the second auxiliary pulley has an absorbing horsepower smaller than that of the first auxiliary driven by the first auxiliary pulley. With this structural arrangement, in addition to an effect of the first feature of the present invention, the first and second auxiliary pulleys can be driven efficiently in correspondence to the magnitudes of the absorbing horsepowers of the auxiliaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, to achieve the above object, according to a third feature of the present invention, in addition to the arrangement of the first or second feature, the engine body is provided with a projection for preventing the mis-reeving of the endless transmitting belt. With this structural arrangement, in addition to the effect of the first or second feature of the present invention, the mis-assembling of the transmitting belt can be prevented, leading to an enhancement in efficiency of assembling thereof.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The mode for carrying out the present invention will now be described by way of an embodiment of the present invention shown in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment shows a case where an auxiliary-driving system of the present invention is utilized in an engine for an automobile. </paragraph>

The engine body E includes a cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in which a plurality of cylinders are arranged in line, a cylinder head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> coupled onto the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a head cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> covering an upper surface of the cylinder head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an oil pan <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> coupled to a lower surface of a crankcase portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A crankshaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is rotatably carried in the crankcase portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. An intake port <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected to an intake system In is opened in a front surface of the engine body E extending in a direction of the crankshaft (a right surface in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>); and an exhaust port <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> connected to an exhaust system Ex is opened in a rear surface extending in the direction of the crankshaft (a left surface in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an auxiliary-driving system Da in the engine according to the present invention is mounted on one of the sides of the engine body E perpendicular to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (a side perpendicular to a surface of a paper sheet of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The structural arrangement of the auxiliary-driving system Da will hereinafter be described below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is fixed to an outer end of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of recesses and projections are formed circumferentially on an outer peripheral surface of the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as usual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A compressor, which is a first auxiliary <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e., a compressor) is integrally supported at a lower portion of a front side of the engine body E, and a compressor pulley (i.e., a first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is fixed to an end of a drive shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located on the same plane as the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a plurality of recesses and projections are also formed circumferentially on an outer peripheral surface of the auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as usual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a tensioner function is supported in front of an upper portion of the engine body E through a bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the position thereof can be adjusted. As clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an adjusting frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fixed to the bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a threaded rod <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having a grip <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>at its upper end is rotatably carried on the adjusting frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An adjuster <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is slidably engaged in a guide groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>in the adjusting frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and is threadedly fitted over the threaded rod <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. An idler pulley shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is integrally, projectingly provided on the adjuster <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; and the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the tensioner function is rotatably carried on the idler pulley shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with ball bearings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. When the grip <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is grabbed to turn the threaded rod <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the adjuster <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> threadedly engaged on the threaded rod <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be advanced and retracted for adjustment along with the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with respect to the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which will be described hereinafter. The idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located on the same plane as the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of recesses and projections are also formed circumferentially on an outer peripheral surface of the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as usual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the tensioner function are disposed in a triangular configuration with the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> located in an uppermost position, as viewed in the direction of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An inner surface of an endless transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a plurality of recesses and projections formed thereon in the longitudinal direction is reeved around the outer peripheral surfaces of the pulleys <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A water pump, which is a second auxiliary <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is integrally supported at a front portion of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the engine body E. A pump pulley (i.e., a second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a diameter larger than that of the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is fixed to an outer end of a pump shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the water pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disposed in a space defined by the three parts (i.e., the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the tensioner function), which are disposed in the triangular configuration; and at a location closer to the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located on the same plane as the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and a flat inner surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> reeved around the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is reeved around a smooth outer peripheral surface of the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disposed between the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and also at the location closer to the pulleys <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Consequently, a large reeving angle of the inner surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with respect to the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be ensured; and a large reeving angle of the outer surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with respect to the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be ensured. Even if the flat outer surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is reeved around the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a large friction transmitting force by the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be ensured by increasing the reeving angle of the flat outer surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Even if the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the second auxiliary, i.e., the water pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (having an absorbing horsepower smaller than that of the first auxiliary <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), is driven by the outer surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having no recess and no projection, a desired friction transmitting force can be ensured by increasing the reeving angle of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to decrease the width and tension of the transmitting belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As indicated by a two-dot dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> bonnet line of the automobile is shown above the engine body E. Since the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the tensioner function is located at the uppermost portion of the auxiliary-driving system Da and just below the bonnet line, the adjustment and maintenance of the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be carried out promptly and easily by opening a bonnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> projection <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as an obstacle for a failsafe is integrally provided in an outward facing manner between the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and on a side of the oil pan <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the engine body E between lowermost portions of the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being accidentally reeved, without via the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, around the other pulleys, as shown by a two-dot dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the crank pulley <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> fixed to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by driving of the engine E drives both the first and second auxiliary pulleys <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the endless transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In this case, the first auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for driving the first auxiliary <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (the compressor) having the relatively large absorbing horsepower is driven by the inner surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>; and the second auxiliary pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for driving the second auxiliary <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (the water pump) having the absorbing horsepower smaller than that of the first auxiliary <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven by the outer surface of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In addition, the width and tension of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be decreased, thereby, providing compactness of the auxiliary-driving system Da and improvement in mileage because both the reeving angles of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with respect to the first and second auxiliary pulleys <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be increased, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The adjustment of the tension of the transmitting belt <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is conducted by controlling the advancement and retraction of the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in turning the threaded rod <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the grip <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>. Since the idler pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located at the uppermost portion of the auxiliary-driving system Da, the adjustment of the tension of the auxiliary-driving system Ds and other maintenance can be carried out promptly and easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment, and various modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For example, the auxiliary-driving system according to the present invention has been described as being utilized in the engine for the automobile in the above-described embodiment, but may of course be utilized in an engine for another application. Means for increasing the friction transmitting force, such as some recesses and projections to provide unevenness, may be provided on the outer surface of the transmitting belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, according to the present invention, in the auxiliary-driving system having the pulleys and the transmitting belt, both the reeving angles of the inner surface and outer surface of the transmitting belt with respect to the first and second auxiliary pulleys can be determined to be large. Thus, it is possible to decrease the width and tension of the transmitting belt and to achieve compactness of the auxiliary-driving system and improvement in mileage. It is also possible to easily carry out the adjustment of the tension of the transmitting belt and other maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the present invention, the first and second auxiliary pulleys can be driven efficiently in correspondence to the magnitudes of the absorbing horsepowers of the auxiliaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the mis-assembling of the transmitting belt can be prevented, leading to an enhancement in efficiency of assembling thereof. </paragraph>
