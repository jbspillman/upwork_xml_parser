<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of survival radios and, more particularly, to a search and rescue system consisting of a primary interrogation, decoding and display unit and a plurality of portable beacon radios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Radio based search and rescue systems are in common usage in aviation. Personal survival radios (PSR) are standard equipment for military pilots and for others who routinely carry out missions in remote locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Most search and rescue systems are based on determining the position of a downed aviator&apos;s emergency emitter, customarily a beacon radio, by means of various types of direction finding and range finding devices that detect its signal. Early versions of such technology required the radio beacon signal to be transmitted continuously in order to calculate range and bearing. Later versions employed GPS technology to enable the beacon to produce its own location information. GPS technology does not require that the radio transmit continuously. Rather, the searching transceiver may periodically prompt the PSR to transmit GPS generated location information. Such prompting, obviating the need for continuous signal transmission, provides many benefits, particularly in combat environments where disclosure of the survivor&apos;s position may expose him to harm from enemy forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The technology of survival radios is well known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,679 assigned to Motorola, Inc., reflects an airborne GPS based system that incorporates &ldquo;over the horizon&rdquo; extended range capability. U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,510, also assigned to Motorola, Inc., teaches a PSR as an element of an airborne search and rescue system which transmits a GPS derived location signal. Such technology, which was specifically conceived and designed for military and paramilitary use, is incorporated into Motorola, Inc.&apos;s AN/PRC-112 PSR. This radio, and others like it, have wide application in aviation for rescuing downed airmen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The systems referred to above are designed to be installed within aircraft. They allow an airborne searching transceiver to send interrogation messages to an identified PSR. Upon receiving such a message, the PSR will respond with location information and, in some cases, a text message. Such systems use the transceiver of the aircraft in which they are installed and therefore communicate on the UHF frequencies utilized by the avionics of the aircraft. Such systems are not portable, versatile nor capable of various applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A further limitation of such systems is the inability of one PSR to communicate with another PSR. This feature would be particularly helpful when more than one airman from the same aircraft is down within a relatively small geographic area and contact between them would enhance their chances of survival. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a simple, portable, versatile and inexpensive search and rescue system that incorporates a number of small hand-held units that may communicate among themselves. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Input and output signals between processor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and transciever <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> pass through modulator/demodulator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Modulator/demodulator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is a standard voice modem that modulates outgoing data on a voice channel to fit any transceiver input signal requirements and demodulates the incoming data on a voice channel from the output signals of a transceiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts transceiver <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as an integral component of PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be of conventional design, configured to operate on standard radio communication frequencies using conventional communication parameters such as baud rate, data format, packet size, AM or FM modulation, etc. Further embodiments of SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will accommodate modifications in radio communication technology as they occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Power pack <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is of a conventional type, designed to deliver appropriate voltages to each of the components of PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as required. Power pack <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is powered by a battery (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is designed to function in four different modes. Its primary function is to serve as a location finding device and as such it serves as a transponder, responding with GPS signals, location information or other text messages to prompts from IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Secondly, PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can remotly interrogate other PSUs to prompt their GPS location information. Thirdly, PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may exchange text messages with other PSU&apos;s. Such messages may be user generated by keying in with input interface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, or may be predetermined messages stored in memory <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and selected for transmission. The fourth mode is voice communication exchange with other PSU&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> which is a black box diagram which illustrates the communication function between the components of SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has bilateral communication with PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, with PSU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and with PSU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. According to the described preferred embodiment, communication between IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is limited to prompting and interrogation messages sent by IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to one or more of the PSU&apos;s and the text response of the recipient. The initiating message by IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an identification code which is read and matched to a stored identification code by processor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the relevant PSU. A correct match prompts the PSU to respond by transmitting GPS signals or location information derived therefrom to IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The response is received by IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and stored in its memory <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and displayed on its output interface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, thus enabling the search party to learn the location of the relevent PSU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The Global Positioning System may be used to determine the position of a GPS receiver on or near the surface of the earth from signals received from a constellation of satellites. The orbits of the GPS satellites are arranged in multiple planes in order that signals can be received from at least four satellites at any position on earth. Accordingly, GPS provides a high degree of accuracy both in identifying bearings and, further, in determining a relative distance between two GPS receivers. Either commercial GPS or the military GPS may be used and both provide a degree of accuracy of less than five meters deviation from the actual distance between receivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In addition to bilateral communication of text messages between IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may communicate text messages between themselves. For example, communication may be initiated by PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which sends an identification code and an interrogation message to PSU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The interrogation message may be automatic such as a request for location information, it may be selected from stored predetermined interrogation messages or it may be generated by the user of PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The identification code is read and matched to a stored identification code by PSU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A correct match prompts PSU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to transmit an appropriate response message, which may also be an automatic response such as location information or it may be selected from stored predetermined response messages or it may be generated by the user of PSU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Text messages are displayed on the display screen of output interface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and stored in memory <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If the length of the message exceeds the capacity of the display screen, it will be displayed in a scrolling manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In addition, PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may communicate audio messages between themselves. Such audio messages include the transmission of an identification code which prompts the receiving PSU to enter into an audio reception/response mode. Response messages similarly include an identification code which matches the receiving PSU. This feature, in particular, provides an added element of effectiveness to SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The searching party, customarily equipped with IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will also be equipped with a PSU so that voice communication may be established as the sought party is approached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used in a wide range of environments, including hostile environments in which the users of PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are being sought by hostile forces. In such situations, IDDU <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and each PSU may be programmed to transmit its own identification code with all outgoing messages so that a recipient may identify the initiator of the message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the scope and nature of the messages capable of being transmitted between IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will evolve as technology permits and the above description is not intended to be considered as limiting in this regard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It is easily appreciated that SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enjoys a wide range of applications as a commercial product rather than as exclusively military or paramilitary equipment. As described hereinbefore, SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be designed and configured to be part of or incorporated into an existing mobile radio communication system. Accordingly, SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be manufactured and marketed as a relatively inexpensive piece of personal safety equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is particularly useful for the adventurous consumer who flies, sails, hikes or climbs, having features that render it easily man-portable. The SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> system is lightweight and easily hand carried. PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is easily included among the equipment customarily packed on the above listed adventures and many others. Additional features which enhance its portability include a compact design, rugged construction, and the possibility, in the case of not being integrated with a transceiver, of easy connectability to existing transceivers, compatibility with standard communication systems, and simple operation. It is anticipated that SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be an item offered not only in electronics stores but also by adventure outfitters and nautical supply houses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Moreover, SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has wide application in the personal security field by providing detection in cases of kidnapping, carjacking and the like, and in theft prevention by detecting the location of cargo or goods exposed to unauthorized conversion in which PSU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is secreted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be employed from a wide range of rescue platforms. Although IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be easily installed in a search aircraft which has avionics including a transceiver, IDDU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with power pack <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> enabled may also be easily brought aboard a balloon, an ultralight or a glider along with a portable transceiver. It may be installed in a search vessel seeking sailors lost at sea or may be brought aboard sport vessels by sunday sailors who intend to venture beyond shore sight. Indeed, SARS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sufficiently light and compact to be backpacked into a wilderness area by a ground based rescue team or by a group of hikers in order to provide for the possibility that members of the group may be separated and lost. It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description.
