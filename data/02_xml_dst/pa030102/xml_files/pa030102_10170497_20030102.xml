<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to the field of powder studies. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of systems for treating powders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there has been increased interest in the use of powders for an extremely wide range of technologies. For example, powders are now used in a variety of fields that include the food and pharmaceutical industries. They are also used as abrasives, pigments, plastics, magnetic coating materials, etc. There is, accordingly, a general need within the field of powder studies for developing methods tailored to treat powders and provide them with specific desirable properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Important powder properties include flowability and cohesion. Flowability may affect the transport of powders, such as into molds, through pneumatic systems, and to and from containers. In pharmaceutical applications, where powder medicaments can be delivered through an inhaler device, poor flowability may cause blockages in the powder transport system. The cohesion of the powder directly affects how consistently the powder will behave under similar circumstances. Strongly cohesive powders tend to exhibit chaotic behavior while weakly cohesive powders show more consistency in their behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One technique for affecting the properties of powders uses dry particle coating, in which fine guest particles are coated on a much larger host particle. The principle of dry particle coating is that, within a powder, a layer of ultrafine guest particles may be deposited on the outer surface of relatively larger, but still small, host particles. The layer may be discontinuous, for partial coverage of the host particles, or may be continuous, for complete coverage, and generally acts to change surface properties. For example, the coating of guest particles may lower the cohesive forces acting between host particles to enhance the powder flow behavior. The modified outer surface layer may alternatively be designed to protect the inner host material by changing the chemistry or hardness of the host-particle surface. It may, for example, inhibit particle dissolution or provide other protection to prevent damage to the host particles from chemical, thermal, or mechanical stresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Most previously used dry-particle-coating processes, including the Aveka, Theta-composer, Mechanofusion, and Hybridizer processes, subject the powder to severe collisions and/or compressive and shear forces that act to break up agglomerates to achieve intimate contact between the guest and host particles. One such process, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,369, which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes, attempts to achieve a less-severe environment for dry particle coating. This process uses a centrifuging fluidized bed of cohesive powder mixed with agglomerates of ultrafine guest particles. The use of a fluidizing gas, however, leads to undesirable aerosolization of the fine guest particles. Scavenging of the guest particles from the fluidizing gas flow, such as with a fine filter, adds to the cost of the process. It would therefore be desirable to provide a method for dry particle coating that avoids aerosolization of the guest particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is also often desirable to agglomerate fine cohesive powders to a particular size. Some powders, such as certain submicron-scale powders are usually cohesive and naturally agglomerate together in an irregular manner. When such powders are put into a typical agglomerating rotating drum, they sometimes form large (&gt;1 mm diameter) nearly spherical agglomerates. It would be desirable to provide a method capable of producing much smaller uniformly sized agglomerations, having a diameter on the order of a few microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While improvements in each of the areas discussed above are desirable, it would be especially advantageous to provide a single apparatus that simultaneously permits improvements in all of those areas. Such an apparatus would realize cost and efficiency advantages that are not available when the use of multiple apparatuses is required for different applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention thus provide a method and apparatus for treating a cohesive powder, such as drying, mixing, coating, grinding, or agglomerating the cohesive powder. A drum containing the cohesive powder is rotated. The rotating drum is centrifuged to increase an effective g force acting on the rotating drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the centrifugal action is achieved by rotating a centrifugal arm about a first axis. The drum is coupled with the centrifuging arm and configured to rotate about a second axis substantially parallel to the first axis. In certain embodiments, a plurality of such drums is provided. The drum may be configured to roll along the inside surface of a chamber that is configured for rotation about the first axis. Alternatively, the drum and centrifuging arm may be configured for independent rotation. In either case, mechanical linkages may be implemented to drive the assembly with a single drive or with multiple drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the drum further contains a granular guest material composed of guest particles smaller in size than particles of the powder, thereby permitting the powder to be coated with the granular material. A mass ratio between the powder and the granular material may be less than 10%. In other embodiments, the drum contains one or more impact-enhancing particles. In further embodiments, the drum contains a plurality of grinding balls to grind the cohesive powder. In still other embodiments, the drum contains an agglomerating agent to promote agglomeration of the powder. In yet additional embodiments, the drum contains two or more powders to be blended or mixed intimately.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods and apparatuses that may be used to treat cohesive powders, such as by allowing dry particle coating, agglomeration, mixing, drying, and/or grinding. Such powder treatment is achieved with a partially filled rotating drum, which may be cylindrical in shape, in a centrifuged arrangement that provides high effective g levels (&ldquo;g*&rdquo;) that can overcome the cohesive forces between powder particles. A variety of centrifuged arrangements may be used, some of which are described below for purposes of illustrating aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For fine cohesive powders (&lt;20 &mgr;m, for example), rotating drums at normal g levels often do not achieve the desired break-up of agglomerates or thorough enough mixing on a particle scale because the Earth&apos;s gravity acting on the powder does not achieve sufficiently high forces to break the cohesive bonds between the particles. This is especially true for the types of powders used in the pharmaceutical industry. Uniform mixing of fine cohesive powders at normal g levels is particularly difficult to achieve. Operating partially filled rotating drums in a centrifuging environment overcomes several limitations present with normal g levels and broadens the range of processes and particulates that can be processed. For example, as described in detail below, mixing and/or coating can be achieved for fine cohesive powders in a centrifuging environment with an effective g level in the range of 200 g to 2000 g, but the same processes cannot be performed effectively with the same powders in rotating drums at 1 g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 1. Rolling-Drum Centrifuge </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Certain embodiments of the invention use a rolling-drum centrifuge configuration in which a partially filled drum of powder rolls on the inside circumference of a larger rotating container. An example of one such embodiment is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The mechanical principles of the invention are illustrated with this embodiment, although the rolling of the drum and the centrifuged arrangement may be achieved in alternative ways, such as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this illustrated embodiment, the rolling-drum centrifuge <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes two powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, although it will be evident that it may be configured with an arbitrary number of drums. Each of the powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has an inside radius r<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and an outside radius r<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. The outside container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is configured as a cylinder with radius R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and rotates at an angular speed &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>relative to the fixed Earth frame. The two powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are connected with a centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> adapted to rotate about centrifuge axle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> rotates with angular speed &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>relative to the fixed Earth frame. Each of the powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is mounted about a drum axle <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> connected with the centrifuging arm at a radius R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from the centrifuge axle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Mounting of the drum axle <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> so that it is connected with the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> allows for slight movement in the radial direction to account for strain as the centrifugal acceleration varies. In an alternative embodiment, the powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are supported by exterior rollers instead of an axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Since the rotation rate &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the outside container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is controlled independently of the rotation rate &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> roll around the inner circumference of the outside container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at angular speed &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>relative to the fixed Earth frame. This angular speed may be expressed as a relative rolling angular speed &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>with respect to a frame rotating with the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at angular speed &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. When the rotation speeds of the outer container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are nearly equal, &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&cong;&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> roll slowly around the circumference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes several arrows indicating the direction of motion of components of the rolling-drum centrifuge <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a particular embodiment of the invention where &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&gt;&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&gt;0 and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&lt;&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, so that &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&gt;0. A closed-form expression for &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may be derived in terms of the absolute angular speeds &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by imposing the slip-free rolling condition. Thus, the radius of the outside container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is equal to the sum of the radial position of the drum axle <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the radius of the drum axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;r</italic></highlight>, </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> and the slip-free rolling condition equates the linear speeds of the powder drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at the point of contact with the outside container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the circumferential speed of the outside container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;r</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Using these results, the effective rolling rate of the powder drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is determined from the difference in absolute angular speeds of the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the powder drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&equals;&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&equals;&lsqb;1&plus;(<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/r</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&rsqb;&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;(<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/r</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Some approximate dimensional and speed values illustrate the operation of the centrifugal rotating drum. For example, for the centrifugal acceleration from the relative rolling of the powder drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to be two orders of magnitude less than that of the principal centrifuging acceleration, i.e. &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>r<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&lE;0.01 &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, then </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>/</superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&lE;0.01(<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/r</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>1/2 </superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, if R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&cong;10 cm, r<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&cong;1 cm, and r<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&cong;0.5 cm, the ratio &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is approximately 0.71, which is achieved by setting &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>about 6.5% slower or faster than &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. For centrifuging accelerations in the range of 1000 g, the angular speeds, &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, would be on the order of 3000 revolutions per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An example of a drive arrangement that may be used to configure the embodiment that uses a rolling-drum centrifuge is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. Powder drums <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are engaged with beam <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which acts as the centrifuging arm. The outside container is provided as a frame <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> configured to be continuous with a sleeve <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that surrounds a portion of a spindle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> that acts as the centrifuge axle. Belt drives are provided for rotation of the sleeve <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and of the spindle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>.

Angular speeds &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are determined not only by the rotation speed of shaft <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, but also by the relative sizes of pulleys <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> so that &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may be defined independently. In an alternative embodiment, the drums <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are supported by exterior rollers instead of an axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A second example of a drive arrangement that may be used to configure the rolling-drum centrifuge is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. Powder drums <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are engaged with beam <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, which acts as the centrifuging arm. The beam <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> is configured for engagement with the shaft <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> of a first motor <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> such that rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> by the first motor <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> causes rotation of the beam <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> at angular speed &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The outside container is provided as a frame <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> that is configured for engagement with the shaft <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> of a second motor <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> such that rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> by the second motor <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> causes rotation of the frame <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> at angular speed &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 2. Geared Centrifuged Rotating Drum </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments that use a geared system, rather than a rolling-drum system, are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. These embodiments may achieve the same dynamical properties as the rolling-drum configurations. In particular, the powder-containing drums rotate to treat the powder, but are subjected to centrifugal forces that cause high effective g levels to overcome cohesive forces between the powder particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> One embodiment that uses a single driving mechanism is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Powder drums <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are engaged with beam <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, which acts as the centrifuging arm. The powder drums <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are connected with gears <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and the beam <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is connected with gear <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, which is engaged with gears <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The powder drums <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are rotated with this gear arrangement by a first belt that includes belt <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> configured as an endless loop engaged with pulleys <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. Pulley <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is fixedly coupled with a sleeve <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> that is in turn coupled with gear <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. Accordingly motion of belt <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> results in rotation of sleeve <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and gear <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, which transfers rotational motion to the powder drums <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> through gears <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. A second belt drive is configured to rotate the beam <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, which is continuous with a spindle <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that acts as the centrifuge axle. The second belt drive includes belt <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> configured as an endless loop engaged with pulleys <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. Pulley <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is fixedly coupled with spindle <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> so that motion of belt <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> results in rotational motion of the spindle <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Pulleys <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> are coupled with a common shaft <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, which is driven by motor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. Angular speeds &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are determined not only by the rotation of shaft <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, but also by the relative sizes of pulleys <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> and by the gear ratios between gear <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and gears <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, so that &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may be defined independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A second example of a geared drive arrangement that uses two drives is shown in cross-section view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. Powder drums <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are engaged with beam <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, which acts as the centrifuging arm. The beam <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is configured for engagement with the shaft <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of a first motor <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> such that rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> by the first motor <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> causes rotation of the beam <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The powder drums <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are connected with gears <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, which are in turn coupled with gear <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. Gear <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> is configured for engagement with the shaft <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> of a second motor <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> so that rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> transmits rotational motion to the powder drums <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> through the gear arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 3. Exemplary Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of how the centrifuged rotating drum is configured, the combined features of drum rotation with large effective g values may be exploited in embodiments of the invention to treat cohesive powders in a variety of ways. Such treatment may include drying, mixing, coating, agglomerating and/or grinding, among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show simulation results that illustrate generally the behavior of a granular material such as a powder within the rotating-drum centrifuge. The figures exemplify the behavior of the powder for different rotation speeds &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. At slow rotation speeds, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the flow has a well-defined angle of repose &phgr;<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>. At low rolling rates, periodic avalanches may occur. As drum rotation speed &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>increases, inertial effects of the powder being carried beyond the equilibrium height at the top of the incline cause an increase in the dynamic angle of repose &phgr;<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>. The increase in &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>also causes a change in character of the top surface from nearly linear to an approximate S shape having a steeper slope in the upper half and a flatter slope in the lower half. At still faster rotation speeds, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the cascading flow becomes a continuous gentle flow of a cresting wavelike ballistic trajectory for the particles as the angle of repose is exceeded. The operating flexibility provided by the independent rotation rate control allows the cascading flow to vary in energy intensity, from a flow as gentle as that of a centrifuging fluidized bed, to as intense as a grinding ball mill operating at high effective g values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The main centrifuging acceleration, A<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, and the centrifugal acceleration, a<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, due to rotation of the powder-containing drum can be varied to achieve various ballistic, cascading powder beds useful for particle coating. Images of powder flow at the same g level of 330 g but with different rotation rates are depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, respectively. For <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 5B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, the centrifugal acceleration due to rotation of the powder-containing drum is 0.8, 0.55, and 0.2 times the main centrifuging acceleration. The operating flexibility provided by the independent rotation rate control allows the cascading flow to vary in energy intensity, from a flow as gentle as that of a centrifuging fluidized bed, to as intense as a grinding ball mill operating at high effective g values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> a. Dry Particle Coating </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention may thus be used for improved methods of dry particle coating since the flexibility of the centrifuged rotating drum makes it possible to achieve a gentle processing environment without the use of a fluidizing gas. In particular, as discussed above, the physical operation of the rolling-drum centrifuge may be adjusted to achieve a wide variety of flow behaviors. The powder drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is partially filled with a cohesive powder that comprises the host particles and with a quantity of material that comprises the guest particles (or additive particles), which may be of approximately submicron size. In some embodiments, the mass ratio between the host powder and the guest material is less than 10%. In one embodiment, this mass ratio is less than 1%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The rolling-drum centrifuge is operated within a region of its operating characteristics that acts to mix the materials continuously, thereby bringing the host and guest materials into contact to effect the dry particle coating of the host powder. Such characteristics may be achieved by choosing dimensions (r<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, r<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and rotation speeds (&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) so that the centrifugal acceleration due to rotation of the powder drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is less than twice the centrifuging acceleration of the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The centrifuging acceleration of the centrifuging arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is usually greater than 10 g, but for some free-flowing powders may be as small as 40 g. Under such conditions, sufficient forces are provided to break up the cohesive host powder and to create collisions between the host and guest particles required to achieve dry particle coating. Furthermore, the operating conditions may be adjusted to maximize the effectiveness of the coating according to a number of properties of the host powder and the guest material, such as the relative sizes of the host and guest particles and the cohesiveness of the host powder and guest material. The method thus not only avoids the need for a fluidizing gas flow, but permits increased operational flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The host powder preferably comprises a pharmaceutically active agent, with or without additional excipients. The host powder may be prepared by methods known in the art such as micronization, solvent evaporation, supercritical fluid processing, or spray drying. Suitable pharmaceutically active agents, excipients, and processes for the preparation are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,851,453, 6,063,138, 6,051,256, and in WO 96/32149, WO 01/00312, and WO 02/09669, all of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. Alternatively, the host particle may comprise an excipient or flow-aid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The guest material preferably comprises an excipient or flow aid such as an amino acid such as leucine, tri-leucine, isoleucine, lysine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine, a metal stearate such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or sodium stearate, or a surface active material such as phospholipids or fatty acids such as oleic acid, lauric acid, and stearic acid. Such excipient and flow-aids are disclosed in, for example, WO 96/32149 set forth above, and in WO 97/23485 and WO 02/00197, hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. It is possible that the guest material comprises a pharmaceutically active agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, a small number of relatively large particles are included in the flowing material to enhance impacts. In one embodiment, such impact-enhancing particles may comprise ceramic spheres. With such particles, the impacts may mimic the intensity of those provided by magnetically assisted impact processes, but avoid the need for an externally applied oscillatory magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This general method may be adapted to a number of different processing modes. In one embodiment, the method is used as part of a batch process in which the powder drums <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are completely closed during dry particle coating and may be operated at elevated or reduced air pressure, or with a controlled humidity. They may be filled with any desired gas to enhance or prevent chemical reactions during the mechanical processing. In an alternative embodiment, the powder drums are open to ambient pressure and used as part of a continuous process in which host powder and guest materially are flowed into one end of a drum <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and coated powder is flowed out the other end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> b. Agglomeration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The rolling-drum centrifuge may also be used to agglomerate fine cohesive powders to a particular size, including sizes on the order of a few microns. For such applications, the rolling-drum centrifuge is operated with a powder-drum angular speed &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>so that an approximately linear, continuously flowing dynamic angle of repose is achieved. The dimensional (r<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, r<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and rotation-speed parameters (&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &OHgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) used to produce such a flow depend on the specific characteristics of the powder to be agglomerated, including particle size and cohesion. An appropriate flow is generally achieved with a ratio of centrifugal accelerations &Dgr;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>r<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&lE;0.05&OHgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, this ratio is in the range of 0.0001 to 0.02. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The method may be modified in a number of different ways if the particles are insufficiently cohesive to create the desired agglomeration. For example, in one embodiment, the operating environment is specifically configured to promote agglomeration. This may be achieved, for example, by increasing the humidity to result in a temporary increase in the magnitude of the cohesive forces acting between the particles. In another embodiment, an agglomerating agent is added to the powder to promote agglomeration despite the relatively weak cohesive forces. Appropriate agglomerating agents will depend on the particular powder compositions used and will be known to those of skill in the art. Typical agglomerating agents include polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly (oxyethylene), polyethyleneglycol, carbowax, nonionic surfactants, fatty acids, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin, fatty alcohols, phosphates and polyphosphates, clays, aluminosilicates and polymeric polycarboxylates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> c. Grinding/Milling </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, the powder in the powder drum may be ground to a finer state by including a number of relatively larger, hard, grinding balls inside the powder drum. When the powder drum is rotated sufficiently fast to cause ballistic or arcing flow with high energy impacts near the toe of the flow, the powder is effectively ground. With the larger effective g values provided by the centrifuged mechanism, it is possible to grind the powder to a finer state than would be possible with normal g values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> d. Blending </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In yet further embodiments, two or more powders are placed in the powder drum and the powder drum is rotated while being centrifuged to achieve intimate mixing on a particle scale. According to this embodiment, a blend of two or more drugs can be obtained, or an excipient or flow aid can be blended with at least one additional drug. Suitable drugs and excipients are disclosed in the patents and patent applications set forth above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Having described several embodiments, it will be recognized by those of skill in the art that various modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents may be used without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
