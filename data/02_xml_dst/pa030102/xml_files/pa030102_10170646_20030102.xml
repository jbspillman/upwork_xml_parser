<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. P2001-38130, filed in Korea on Jun. 29, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory, and more particularly, to a reference circuit in a ferroelectric memory and a method for driving the same, which can stabilize the reference level and enable a reference capacitor to be commonly used by adjacent cell array blocks in order to reduce a layout area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Generally, a nonvolatile ferroelectric memory device, (i.e., ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM)) has a data processing speed that is substantially the same as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and also retains data even in power-off. For this reason, the nonvolatile ferroelectric memory has been highly regarded as a next generation memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As a memory device having a structure similar to that of a DRAM, FRAM uses a high residual polarization, which is a characteristic of ferroelectric, by using ferroelectric as a component of a capacitor. Due to such characteristic of a residual polarization, data remains unerased even if the electric field is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a hysteresis loop of a typical ferroelectric. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, even if the electric field that induced a polarization is removed, the data is maintained at a certain amount (the &ldquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; states) due to the presence of the residual polarization (or spontaneous polarization). A nonvolatile ferroelectric memory cell is constructed by regarding the &ldquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; states as &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A related art ferroelectric memory device will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a cell array block of a typical ferroelectric memory, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a main cell in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The cell array block includes a plurality of sub cell arrays. Adjacent top and bottom sub cell arrays sub_T and sub_B are formed, and a sensing amplifier S/A block is formed between the sub cell arrays sub_T and sub_B. That is, one sensing amplifier circuit is correspondingly formed per each bit line, and a column selector CS is formed at the end of the bit line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Each of the sub cell arrays includes bit line Top_B/L (or Bot_B/L), a plurality of main cells MC connected to the bit line Top_B/L (or Bot_B/L), a reference cell RC connected to the bit lines Top_B/L (or Bot_B/L), and a column selector CS. The column selector CS selectively activates a corresponding column bit line using Y (column) address. If the column selector CS is in the high level, the corresponding column bit line is connected to a data bus to enable data transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The structure of a main cell of the cell array with the aforementioned structure will now be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> main cell MC is constructed such that a bit line B/T is formed in one direction, and a word line W/L is formed to cross the bit line. A plate line P/L is spaced apart from the word line W/L in the same direction as the word line W/L. A transistor T with a gate connected to the word line W/L and a source connected to the bit line B/L is formed. A ferroelectric capacitor FC is formed in such a manner that its first terminal is connected to a drain of the transistor T and its second terminal is connected to the plate line P/L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The structure and operation of a related art reference cell of a ferroelectric memory with the aforementioned structure will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a reference cell of the related art ferroelectric memory. In each reference cell, a bit line B/L is formed in one direction, a reference word line REF_W/L is formed to cross the bit line, a switch block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is controlled by a signal on the reference word line to selectively transmit a reference voltage stored in the ferroelectric capacitor bit line. Ferroelectric capacitors are connected to the input terminal of the switching block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in parallel. The level initializing block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> selectively initializes a level of the input terminal of the switching block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> connected to the ferroelectric capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The switching block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes an NMOS transistor (also referred to as &ldquo;first transistor&rdquo;) T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a gate connected to the reference word line REF_W/L, a drain connected to the bit line B/L, and a source connected to a storage node SN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The level initializing block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is controlled by a reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ, which is a control signal for initializing the storage node SN of the reference cell. The level initializing block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes an NMOS transistor (also referred to as &ldquo;second transistor&rdquo;) T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected between the source of the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a ground terminal Vss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The number of ferroelectric capacitors FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . , FCn is determined depending on the capacitor size of the reference cell. The storage node SN is connected with first terminals of the ferroelectric capacitors FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . , FCn in parallel. In other words, FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a basic connection terminal, and FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . , FCn may be provided additionally depending on the need. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ initializes the storage node to a ground voltage level. Namely, when the reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ is in the high level, the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on so that the storage node is maintained at a ground voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned reference cell will now be described. Qs and Qns of a hysteresis loop of a ferroelectric shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> denote the switching charge of the ferroelectric capacitor and the non-switching charge of the ferroelectric capacitor, respectively. The reference cell is based on Qns. In other words, the reference word line REF_W/L within the operation cycle is raised to the high level together with the reference plate line REF_P/L. Accordingly, charges equivalent to the size of Qns&times;(ferroelectric capacitor) are supplied to the bit line B/L. In this case, the reference word line REF_W/L is changed to the low level before the sensing amplifier is operated, so that the reference cell is not affected by a voltage of the bit line. Meanwhile, the reference plate line REF_P/L is maintained at the high level, and is changed to the low level when the reference word line is sufficiently stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As described above, since non-switching charges Qns are used, a separate restoring operation is not required during a precharge period. Accordingly, the high level in the reference word line REF_W/L is not required any longer than this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Since the reference level is affected by an initial level of the storage node SN, the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is used to stabilize the storage node SN, and the reference equalizer control signal REF_EQ is used to initialize the storage node to the ground voltage level. Therefore, since the initial level of the storage is maintained at the ground voltage level, the reference level can be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The method of operation will now be described with reference to a hysteresis loop and a timing chart of the reference cell. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a hysteresis loop of the reference cell of the related art ferroelectric memory, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a timing chart illustrating the operation of a reference cell according to the related art. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an operation cycle begins as a chip enable signal CEBpad is changed to the low level, so that active periods A, B, and C are formed. A precharge period D begins as the chip enable signal CEBpad is changed to the level. One cycle is completed by passing through the precharge period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the active period of the chip begins, an address is decoded during the periods A and B. Then, various control signals are activated, and the reference word line REF_W/L and the reference plate line REF_P/L are changed from the low level to the high level. As the reference word line REF_W/L and the reference plate line REF_P/L are changed from the low level to the high level, the reference cell data are transmitted to each bit line in the period C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Then, reference plate line REF_P/L is changed to the low level in the precharge period D. Therefore, by maintaining the low level in the remaining periods, the reference plate line REF_P/L is maintained at the low level, thereby preventing voltage to pass through the both electrodes of the reference cell in the ferroelectric capacitor. From a moment that the reference plate line REF_P/L is changed from the high level to the low level, the reference plate line REF_P/L is changed from the &ldquo;a&rdquo; state to the &ldquo;b&rdquo; state as time passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Therefore, depending on a lapse of time after the reference plate line REF_P/L is changed from the high level to the low level, a non-destructive charge varies between the value Qns and the value Q&apos;ns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Due to such inconsistency of the non-destructive charge, the reference bit line REF_B/L level maintained by the non-destructive charge also varies accordingly. Therefore, due to the Qns and Q&apos;ns values, the reference level varies inconsistently and so reduces the sensing margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned ferroelectric memory device and method for driving a reference cell of the related art has the following disadvantages. Since the non-destructive charge is not constant, the reference bit line level is also changed. As a result, the reference level is not constant and changes under the influence of Qns and Q&apos;ns, thereby reducing the sensing margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Particularly, time dependency has a large effect on a ferroelectric capacitor. This results in a variation in charge amount due to a charge and discharge time, which leads to a large change in the reference level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the related art ferroelectric memory device, only voltage is used to form a reference level, resulting in that the reference level is remarkably varied. In other words, the related art capacitor is highly dependent on time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a reference cell of a ferroelectric memory according to an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a timing chart illustrating the operation of the reference cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. When a ferroelectric memory is not driven for a long period of time, &plus;Pr or &minus;Pr levels degrade, which are initial states of the cell capacitor, and therefore their sizes are varied. This causes a difference in level as compared to situations where the ferroelectric memory is not driven for only a short period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In other words, the state of the reference cell, which has more movement than the main cells, is not equal to the state of the main cell. Therefore, the difference in Pr value between the two cells becomes larger, which makes the reference level unstable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The present invention is designed to stabilize the inconsistency of the reference level that occurs due to the difference in time, and provides that the charging time and the discharging time are made uniform in order to utilize the time dependency of the capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the reference circuit of a ferroelectric memory according to this example of the present invention includes a plurality of bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and BLn formed in one direction within the unit cell block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, one reference word line REF_W/L <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> formed in a direction perpendicular to the bit lines, and a reference plate line REF_P/L <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed in the same direction as the reference word line REF_W/L <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The reference circuit also includes a plurality of reference capacitors FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and FCn arranged in parallel, each having a first electrode connected to the reference plate line REF_P/L <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a second electrode connected to a storage node SN of the reference cell, a level initializing unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed of an NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ applied to a gate, one electrode connected to a ground terminal GND and another electrode connected to the storage node SN, and a switching block consisting of a plurality of NMOS transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>having one electrode connected in association with each bit line, another electrode connected to a storage node SN of a reference capacitor, and a gate jointly connected to the reference word line REF_W/L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This reference circuit is formed in correspondence with a unit cell block, which is included in a plurality of sub cell arrays formed inside a cell array. A cell array block includes a plurality of sub cell arrays. A sensing amplifier S/A is formed between adjacent top sub cell array sub_T and bottom sub cell array sub_B. Also, a sensing amplifier circuit is formed in each bit line, and a column selector is formed at the end of each bit line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Each of the sub cell arrays generally includes bit lines Top_B/L (or Bot_B/L), a plurality of main cells MC connected to the bit lines Top_B/L (or Bot_B/L), a reference cell RC connected to the bit lines Top_B/L (or Bot_B/L), and a column selector CS. The column selector CS selectively activates a corresponding column bit line using Y (column) address. If the column selector CS is in the high level, the corresponding column bit line is connected to a data bus to enable data transmission. These basic structures of the sub cell arrays are similar to those depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The structure of the main cell in the cell array of the present example will now be described. In the main cell MC, a bit line B/T is formed in one direction, and a word line W/L is formed to cross the bit line. A plate line P/L is spaced apart from the word line W/L in the same direction as the word line W/L. A transistor T with a gate connected to the word line W/L and a source connected to the bit line B/L is formed. A ferroelectric capacitor FC is formed in such a manner that its first terminal is connected to a drain of the transistor T and its second terminal is connected to the plate line P/L. Each of ferroelectric capacitors FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and FCn includes a first electrode, a second electrode, and a ferroelectric material formed between the two electrodes. Thus, the structure of the main cell is similar to that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ initializes the storage node to a ground voltage level. Namely, when the reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ is in the high level, the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on so that the storage node is maintained at a ground voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned reference cell of a ferroelectric memory according to this embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. One cycle begins as the chip enable signal CEBpad is changed to low level so as to form active periods B, C, and D. Then, as the chip enable signal CEBpad is changed to high level, a precharge period E begins, after which the cycle ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the active period of the chip begins, during period B, the address is decoded and several control signals are activated to change the level of the reference word line <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the reference plate line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from the low level to the high level. As the reference word line <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the reference plate line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are changed from the low level to the high level, the reference cell data is transmitted to each bit line in period C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The reference plate line signal REF_P/L is in the low level only during period B and is in the high level in the other periods. The reference word line signal REF_W/L is in the high level only during period C and in the low level in the other periods. The reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ is in the low level only during period C and in the high level in the other periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As an activating signal of the bit line sensing amplifier, SEN is maintained at the high level during period D to activate the sensing amplifier. The BL signals are activated in period C so as to transmit the main cell data and the reference data to the corresponding bit lines, and are amplified in period D by the SEN. The reference plate line signal REF_P/L and the reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ maintain their respective high levels during the precharge periods A and E. Therefore, when the power is turned on, the reference plate line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> essentially maintains the high level so that the status of the ferroelectric in the ferroelectric capacitors FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, FC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , FCn is located at point &ldquo;f&rdquo; in the hysteresis loop of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At the beginning of the active period (at the beginning of period B), the reference plate line signal REF_P/L is changed to the low level, and accordingly, the status point shifts from point &ldquo;f&rdquo; to point &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the hysteresis loop of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The reference plate line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> charges the reference capacitors with a linear charge Qns only during period D. In other words, the ferroelectric capacitor is highly dependent on time when charging and discharging. This time dependency is controlled, as follows. First, when charging, the time dependency is controlled by properly determining the pulse time of period B, and when discharging, time dependency is controlled by properly determining the pulse time of period C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> After charging during period B, the reference word line <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is turned on and the reference plate line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is changed from the low level to the high level. Namely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, by shifting from point &ldquo;f&rdquo; to point &ldquo;a&rdquo;, the electric charge of the reference capacitor is discharged to the bit line during period C. Therefore, only Qns is always present, and Q&apos;ns is not present. In addition, due to the control of the charge and discharge times by periods B and C, the charged and discharged amounts of the reference capacitors become more accurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> By steadily maintaining the non-destructive charge, which is charged and discharged in the aforementioned manner, the resulting reference bit line level also becomes steady, thereby enhancing the sensing margin. In other words, the Q&apos;ns of a reference ferroelectric capacitors may vary significantly, but the Qns with the controlled time remains stable and unchanged, thereby yielding a constant reference bit line level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A reference cell of a ferroelectric memory according to another embodiment of the present invention will now be described. This example couples two or more of adjacent blocks. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a schematic view illustrating a state in which reference cells described above are commonly operated in adjacent cell array blocks. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a timing chart illustrating the operation of a reference cell in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the reference cell of a ferroelectric memory of this example includes a plurality of cell blocks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and n, a plurality of bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and BLn formed in one direction within each cell block, reference word lines REF_W/L&lt;1&gt;, REF_W/L&lt;2&gt;, . . . , and REF_W/L&lt;n&gt; formed in a direction perpendicular to the bit lines and in correspondence with each cell block, and a reference plate line REF_P/L formed in the same direction as the reference word lines and commonly used by the entire cell blocks. The reference cell further includes a plurality of reference capacitors (F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>), (F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>), . . . , and (Fn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Fn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Fn-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and Fn-n) formed in parallel within the respective cell blocks. Each of the reference capacitors has a first electrode connected to the reference plate line REF_P/L and a second electrode connected to a storage node SN of the reference cell. The reference cell of this example also includes a level initializing unit constructed of an NMOS transistor having a reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ applied to a gate, one electrode connected to a ground terminal GND, and another electrode connected to a storage node SN, and a plurality of NMOS transistors (T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>), (T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>), . . . , and (Tn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Tn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Tn-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and Tn-n) having a gate jointly connected to the reference word lines REF_W/L&lt;1&gt;, REF_W/L&lt;2&gt;, . . . , and REF_W/L&lt;n&gt;, respectively, one electrode correspondingly connected to each bit line, and another electrode connected to the storage node SN of the reference capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this case, the storage node SN is jointly connected to all the second electrodes of the reference capacitors in the cell blocks. Also, the storage node SN is controlled by an external reference cell equalizer control signal REF_EQ through the level initiating unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The reference circuit of the ferroelectric memory of the present invention has a shared structure with all the cell blocks. More specifically, all the cell blocks share the same storage node SN and the same reference plate line REF_P/L. However, each reference word line (REF_W/L&lt;1&gt;, REF_W/L&lt;2&gt;, . . . , REF_W/L&lt;n&gt;) has a separate structure specific to each cell block. Accordingly, all reference capacitors can be commonly used and controlled, and contribute to the size of a reference capacitance as a whole. Therefore, the size of each capacitor can be reduced without using much electric current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a timing chart illustrating the operation of the reference cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The basic operation is similar to that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. An operation cycle begins as chip enable signal CEBpad is changed to the low level, so that active periods B, C, and D are formed. A precharge period E begins as the chip enable signal CEBpad is changed to the high level. One cycle is completed by passing through the precharge period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As explained above, when the active period of the chip begins, the address is decoded during period B and several control signals are activated so that the reference word line and the reference plate line are changed from the low level to the high level. As the reference word line and the reference plate line are changed from the low level to the high level in period C, the reference cell data is transmitted to each bit line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> However, in this example, the reference word line signal REF_W/L of only the selected cell block is maintained at the high level during period C (and is in the low level in all other periods). The reference word line signal REF_W/L of the other cell blocks that are not selected are maintained at the low level in all periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned examples of the reference circuit in a ferroelectric memory and the method for driving the same according to the present invention have the following advantages. First, by controlling the pulse time when charging and discharging the reference capacitor, accurate control of the charged and discharged amount of electric charge becomes possible. In other words, by maintaining a constant non-destructive electric charge, the sensing margin of the ferroelectric memory is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In addition, other reference capacitors can be arranged to be commonly used and controlled when determining the size of a reference capacitor. Therefore, the size can be reduced without using much electric current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the reference circuit in a ferroelectric memory and method for driving the same of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
