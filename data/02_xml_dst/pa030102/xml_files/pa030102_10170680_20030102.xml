A bump electrode joins the circuit on the circuit element and the electrode of the substrate together, and a sealing material joins the circuit element and the substrate together in the periphery of the space between the circuit-forming surface of the circuit element and the substrate. The space between the circuit-forming surface of the circuit element and the substrate is hermetically sealed by the circuit element, the substrate, and the sealing material.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to electronic components and a method for producing the electronic components, and more particularly to an electronic component such as a surface acoustic wave device (SAW device), a high frequency device, and a module or sub-module including an SAW device and a method for producing these devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (First Conventional Example) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The structure of a conventional surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a surface acoustic wave element (chip) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed and die bonded within a ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a cavity structure with a recess formed therein. The surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disposed on the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The top surface of the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is covered by a plate-shaped cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is hermetically sealed by welding the external peripheral portion of the cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the top surface of the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a KOVAR ring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In such a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, since a material such as Al, which has a low degree of moisture tolerance, is used as the electrode material of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, corrosion of the electrodes is retarded by hermetic sealing of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A space is formed between the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so that elastic oscillation of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in such a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, because the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a cavity structure with a recess formed thereon is required, the cost thereof is expensive. The mounting area and height (thickness) thereof are increased by the volume of the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> relative to the size of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that dense mounting of the surface acoustic wave devices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and so forth and miniaturizing of an apparatus in which the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is assembled are prevented. Furthermore, since the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is used, in addition to the manufacturing processes of the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> itself and the KOVAR ring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the connecting process between the ceramic package <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the KOVAR ring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, die bonding of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, welding between the KOVAR ring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, etc., are required, such that the manufacturing processes are complicated and expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (Second Conventional Example) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The structure of another conventional surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a surface acoustic wave element (bare chip) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is flip-chip mounted face down on a wiring substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; and a bump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> disposed on the top surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to a substrate electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> disposed on the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A space between the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is hermetically sealed by a sealing resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to prevent corrosion of the bump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the substrate electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and damage to the connecting portions due to thermal stress differences. Flowing of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> before curing is also prevented by a resin-flow-preventing membrane <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> formed on the top surface of the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the sealing resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> charged between the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a specific dielectric constant of 3 to 4, so that the dielectric characteristic thereof considerably affects the transmission loss and reflecting characteristics of the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Also, the long time required for charging the sealing resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> prevents the manufacturing process from being streamlined. Further, since the surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is sealed by the resin, the resulting restraint of the mechanical elastic oscillation thereof may cause deterioration of the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (Third Conventional Example) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to address the foregoing problems, a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> using both a ceramic package with a cavity structure, and a bump connection, is used without a sealing resin which would prevent elastic oscillation of a surface acoustic wave element and increase its transmission loss. Moreover, such a structure is capable of being miniaturized. Such a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is disposed face down within the ceramic package <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> similar to the described one in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>; a bump <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> disposed on the top surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to an electrode portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>; and the outer peripheral bottom surface of a cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected on the ceramic package <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via a KOVAR ring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of such structure, since the surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is not sealed by a resin, the surface oscillation of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is uninhibited and the characteristics of transmission, reflection, etc., in the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are not deteriorated by a sealing resin. Although the ceramic package <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used, the need for a space for bonding the wire is eliminated by the bump connection so that the ceramic package <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, in such a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, although the ceramic package <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is unitized with the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by the bump connection, it is not different from the first conventional example in the respect that it also uses the ceramic package <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> cannot be miniaturized substantially more than the first conventional example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Conventional Example) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> has been disclosed (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-162690) as a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which neither uses the ceramic package nor has a sealing resin which restrains elastic oscillation of a SAW element&apos;s surface, thereby providing a highly reliable SAW device which can be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, interdigital electrodes (not shown) and an input-output electrode <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are disposed on the surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a bump <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in turn is formed on the input-output electrode <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. An element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is disposed on the periphery of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is laid face down on a mounting substrate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> so that the bump <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to a pick-out electrode <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> disposed in the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected to a substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as well. A space <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> between the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is sealed by the connection between the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is sealed in addition by a sealing resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is coated from the back side of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to encapsulate the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and which further provides shock protection as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is sealed by coating the liquid sealing resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the entire surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and then curing the sealing resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As the sealing resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a conventional molding resin including a volatile solvent is used. (In the embodiment of the above-mentioned unexamined patent publication, a CRP series resin from Sumitomo Bakelite is used.) Such a sealing resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is an insulator. However, in a surface acoustic wave device, a countermeasure against electromagnetic radiation is generally required, especially at higher frequencies. When it is sealed by an insulated sealing resin like that used in the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, it is likely to be affected by electromagnetic radiation and fail to function normally when being used at a high frequency of over 100 MHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, since the surface covered by the sealing resin is curved, when the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is automatically mounted by a vacuum-type chip mounter, the vacuum attraction by the chip mounter is not stable so that frequent mismounting may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In such a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the element-side and substrate-side seal rings <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, made of Au for example, are joined and unitized together by reflow-soldering both of them after they are tentatively crimped together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, to tentatively crimp them together, the element-side and substrate-side seal rings <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, made of Au, must be heated to approximately 250 to 400&deg; C. When the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made of highly pyroelectric material (LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is likely to be damaged by pyroelectricity due to the heating. The pyroelectric damage causes a problem in that characteristics of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are adversely affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then reflow-soldered, after the tentative crimping mentioned above, in order to secure the hermeticity between the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. However, since the melting point of Au is approximately 1000&deg; C., when heating for reflow soldering, the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are required to be heated to approximately 1000&deg; C. or higher. In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, Al is generally used as wiring material, having an approximate melting point of 660&deg; C., which means that the Al wiring will be melted by the reflow heating. When the Al wiring is cut off in this manner, the required electric characteristics cannot be obtained, resulting in producing defective surface acoustic wave devices <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention can solve the problems associated with the conventional devices and provides a small-sized enclosure-type electronic component of simple structure having excellent electric characteristics, and also provides a method for producing an electronic component in which high yield electronic components can be produced without defective products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An electronic component comprises a substrate having a surface on which an electrode is formed and a circuit element having a surface on which a circuit is formed. The circuit element is held such that the surface of the circuit element and the surface of the substrate are opposed to each other. A bump electrode joins the circuit on the circuit element and the electrode on the substrate together, and a sealing material joins the circuit element and the substrate together at the periphery of the space between the circuit-forming surface of the circuit element and the substrate. The space between the circuit-forming surface of the circuit element and the substrate is hermetically sealed by the circuit element, the substrate, and the sealing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this electronic component, a circuit element and a substrate form the component package; a space between the circuit element and the substrate is formed by a bump electrode; and the space between the circuit element and the substrate is sealed by the circuit element, the substrate, and a peripheral sealing material. Therefore, a ceramic package is not required, so that the electronic component can be miniaturized and the cost can be reduced. Furthermore, since the top surface of the circuit element is not covered by a sealing material, the surface thereof can be smoothed, resulting in preventing mounting mistakes during mounting electronic components by an automatic mounter such as a vacuum-type chip mounter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, a low-temperature soldering material such as solder, or an adhesive, is used as the sealing material. &ldquo;Low-temperature&rdquo; in this context means that the soldering material melts at a temperature below the melting point of Au, and furthermore, at a low enough temperature to avoid the problems described above. Since the circuit element and the substrate can be joined together at a comparatively low temperature, the circuit element will not be damaged by the heat, enabling the incidence of defective products to be reduced. When a soldering material such as solder or an adhesive is used as the sealing material, the space between the circuit element and the substrate can securely and hermetically be sealed even if the top of the circuit element is not covered by a sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The size of the circuit element may be approximately the same as the size of the substrate in the electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the electronic component of such structure, the electronic component can be miniaturized by minimizing the size of the substrate, so that a miniature electronic component can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The bump electrode may be formed of Au as a principal ingredient. When the bump electrode formed of Au as a principal ingredient is used, the joining can easily be achieved and resistance across the joined portion can be reduced as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A method for producing electronic components according to an embodiment of the present invention, comprises the steps of: disposing a bump electrode on either a circuit formed on a circuit element or an electrode disposed on a substrate; disposing a sealing material having a smaller height than said bump electrode on the periphery of either the surface on which the circuit is formed on the circuit element or the substrate so as to surround the circuit formed on the circuit element; disposing the surface on which the circuit is formed so as to oppose the substrate; grounding the circuit via the electrode on the substrate by placing the circuit in contact with the electrode on the substrate through the bump electrode; connecting the circuit to the electrode on the substrate through the bump electrode by applying pressure to the bump electrode; and hermetically sealing the periphery of the space between the circuit element and the substrate with the sealing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When an electronic component is produced in this manner, since the circuit is grounded by making contact with the circuit on the substrate via the bump electrode, pyroelectric charge produced in the circuit element when joining the circuit element to the substrate can be dissipated via the bump electrode from the substrate side to ground, so that pyroelectric damage of the circuit element can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The circuit element and the substrate are joined together by simultaneously depositing the bump electrode and the sealing material, so that the manufacturing process of the electronic component can be simplified to increase the manufacturing efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The method may further comprise the steps of joining and unitizing a plurality of circuit elements together on the substrate, the substrate having a size corresponding to a plurality of circuit elements; and then separating the substrate on which the plurality of circuit elements are mounted, to form a plurality of individual electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, plural electronic components can be produced all at once, so that the efficiency of production of the electronic components can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of illustrating the invention, there are shown in the drawings several forms which are presently preferred, it being understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities shown.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> are sectional views of a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Numeral <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represents a surface acoustic wave element which is mounted face down on a mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, on a surface of a piezoelectric substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> formed of a crystal, LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, etc., two sets of interdigital electrodes (IDT electrodes) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> formed of Al, etc. are formed, and an input-output electrode <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is formed for each set of interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. On a surface of the piezoelectric substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, an element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is formed along the entire periphery thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has approximately the same length-to-width size as that of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. On the top and bottom surfaces of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, an internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and an external electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are disposed, respectively, opposing each other, and the electrodes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are conductively connected to each other via a through-hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed in the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> so as to penetrate both sides thereof. Along the entire peripheral portion of the top surface of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is further disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Next, the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is laid face down on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and the input-output electrode <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is joined to the internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by a bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, formed of Au as a principal ingredient, such as an Au bump. The element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are joined by a sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Thus, the space <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between the internal surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (the surface on which the interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are disposed) and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is hermetically sealed by joining the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> using the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. As the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a soldering material formed of Sn or Pb as a principal ingredient is used: for example, Sn group solder, Pb group solder, several kinds of Pb free solder and so forth may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of such structure, a ceramic package like those in the first conventional example and the third conventional example is not used, and since the sealing structure is formed by the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> themselves, miniaturizing and height reduction of the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be achieved. Since the expensive ceramic package is not used, the cost can also be reduced. Since the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is used for connecting the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the space <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between the internal surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can be secured by the height of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so that elastic oscillation of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is not restrained. Furthermore, since wire is not used for bonding, the space for wiring is not required so that the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be even more miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, since the space <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> within which the interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are contained is sealed by only the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the sealing resin as in the second conventional example and the fourth conventional example is not required, so that characteristics of the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are not deteriorated. Furthermore, since the sealing resin is not used, the top surface of the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be formed smoothly, so that the mounting of the components can easily be performed by a chip mounter, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, since the surface thereof is not covered by the sealing resin, it is therefore a smooth surface, so it is easily picked up by a vacuum-type chip mounter, etc., so that the component mounting can securely be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>E, a method for producing the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> will be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is grounded to be maintained at a ground potential, and on the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which in this method is a multiple substrate having a size (area) corresponding to a plurality of the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, is disposed in a predetermined position. A plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are formed in the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> so as to penetrate both sides thereof. The top end of each through-hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is conductively connected to an internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> formed on the top surface of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, while the bottom end of the through-hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is conductively connected to an external electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> formed on the bottom of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, so that each internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and each external electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are conductively connected to each other in a one-to-one relationship via the through-hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. On the top surface of each internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed of Au is disposed by a wire bonding technique, such as the method for fusion connecting an Au wire. In the entire outer periphery of the region corresponding to one surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> on the top surface of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> formed of a metallic material having excellent wetting characteristics for soldering is disposed. As the metallic material having excellent wetting characteristics for soldering, a double-layer structure such as an Au layer deposited on a Ni layer may be used. On the entire periphery of the top surface of this substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> formed of a soldering material such as solder is laid. The sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be formed by placing solder paste on the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by a printing method, for example; reflow soldering in the presence of the solder paste only; and then cleaning the solder paste to eliminate flux remnants. The height of each bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is set to be larger than the height of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> before joining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on the bottom surface of a thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> positioned above the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a plurality of the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed by the interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the input-output electrodes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, etc., on the top surface thereof are held face down by vacuum in a position for being mounted on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> positioned on the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> held by the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface thereof are disposed opposing each other. After being positioned, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, they are placed in contact with each other. At this time, since the height of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is larger than the height of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, when the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is lowered: first, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> strikes the input-output electrode <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>; the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is heated to 250&deg; C. to 400&deg; C.; the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is crushed by the heat and pressure of the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> when the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is further lowered by applying pressure; and thereby, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> touches the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. At this time, sufficient heat is applied to melt the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> formed of soldering material such as solder, and pressure is applied by the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The pressure breaks the oxide membrane of the melting surface of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, which joins the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of each surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>; and simultaneously, the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are diffusion-bonded by the heat of the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the corresponding input-output electrodes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the joining of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the joining of the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be performed simultaneously, so that the number of steps can be reduced for simplification of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the fourth conventional example, it is required to reflow-solder the substrate-side seal ring and the element-side seal ring at approximately 1000&deg; C. In accordance with the present invention, since the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> formed of solder, etc., is used, the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can be joined together by heating at 250&deg; C. to 400&deg; C. so as to seal the space <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, resulting in fewer defective products due to breaks in wiring, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As described above, since the height of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is to be larger than the height of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> before joining, when the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are joined together, before the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are joined together by the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be crushed to be securely joined to the input-output electrodes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, since the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has pyroelectricity, when the temperature is changed, electric charge (pyroelectric charge) is accumulated on the surface thereof. By this mechanism, a discharge is produced between the interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, so that the interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be locally melted, which is likely to cause defective products. This phenomenon is called pyroelectric damage and as pyroelectric-damage-prone materials, LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, etc., are known. The pyroelectric damage can be prevented by letting the charge escape swiftly from the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This is accomplished in the present method as follows. In the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the height of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is to be larger than the height of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and when the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are unitized, first, the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is urged into contact with the input-output electrode <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; and the charge on the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> escapes to the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> via the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The metal crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is grounded and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is laid on the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The external electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are also in a grounded state via the internal picking-out electrodes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the external electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the charge escaping to the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is dissipated to ground via the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. When the temperature of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is increased for joining after it is urged into contact with the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the charge produced on the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is dissipated to ground via the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if a piezoelectric substrate material having high pyroelectricity is used, the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can be joined together without causing the pyroelectric damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In addition, although in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are initially disposed on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> also may be disposed on the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However, if a technique such as wire bumping is utilized, to form the bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a wafer is heated while forming the bump electrode, resulting in probable pyroelectric damage. Therefore, by disposing the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> instead on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be produced with higher yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> After the surface acoustic wave elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are finished being joined together in this manner, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>D, the thermal compression bonding tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is retracted from the position on the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>; the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> joined together is cooled; and the electric charge produced during cooling is dissipated to ground via the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. After the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is cooled, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>E, the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (multiple substrate) is cut apart by dicing, so as to simultaneously produce a plurality of surface acoustic wave devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B. Although the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be produced one by one, the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can more efficiently be produced by simultaneously producing a plurality of them and then splitting them apart as in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C are schematic representations showing the structure and a method for producing a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> according to another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment: a mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> formed of a printed wiring board or a ceramic board, etc., has a larger area than that of a surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>; in an element mounting region on the top surface of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and an internal pick-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are disposed; on the top of the substrate-side seal ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> formed of soldering material such as solder is laid; the internal pick-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is conductively connected to an external electrode (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C) which is formed to be electrically connected to a crimping stage; and on other regions than the SAW element mounting region of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, wiring patterns <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are formed, on which required surface mounting components <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are mounted by soldering, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on the surface of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, input-output electrodes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of interdigital electrodes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and an element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are formed, and bump electrodes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are formed on the input-output electrodes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the height of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is also larger than the height of the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As in the first embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>E, the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is as follows: the above-mentioned mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is laid on the crimping stage (not shown), which is grounded; and the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is held face down by vacuum on the bottom surface of the thermal compression bonding tool (not shown). Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is mounted on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>; and the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is touched to the internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In this state, the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is grounded via the crimping stage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, etc., so that the charge produced in the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is dissipated to ground. At this time, the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is still separate from the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> After the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is touched to the internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in this manner, the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are heated while being crimped by the thermal compression bonding tool and the crimping stage such that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, the bump electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is joined to the internal picking-out electrode <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and further the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is melted to be welded to the element-side seal ring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment also, a case such as a ceramic package also is not required, so that miniaturizing and reducing the height of the surface acoustic wave device can be achieved and the cost can also be reduced. Moreover, hermeticity of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be secured by sealing the periphery of the space between the surface acoustic wave element and the mounting substrate by a sealing material such as solder. Furthermore, since other components can be mounted on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, mounting density of components can be increased, so that the degree of integration of every circuit is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the structure of a surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> according to still another embodiment of the present invention. In this surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, a conductive film <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the external surface of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>; a conductive film <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the external surfaces of the surface acoustic wave element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the sealing material <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>; and the conductive films <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are connected to each other. The conductive films <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are connected to one or more external electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> for grounding, while being insulated from the other external electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this embodiment, even if an insulated mounting substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is used, the surface acoustic wave device <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is provided with electromagnetic radiation-noise control shielding.
