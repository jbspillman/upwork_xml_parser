<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a lithium secondary battery and a method of forming the same, and more particularly to a lithium secondary battery having a negative electrode including a lithium metal as an active material, and a method of forming the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It has been known to ones skilled in the art that a non-aqueous electrolyte lithium secondary battery having a negative electrode including a lithium metal as an active material is not only advantageous in a high energy density and a large electromotive force but also disadvantageous in allowing dendrite crystal to be grown on a surface of the lithium metal of the negative electrode. In worst case, the grown dendrite crystal may project through a separator and reach a positive electrode, resulting in a short circuit formation via the grown dendrite crystal between the negative and positive electrodes. This short circuit formation not only the battery dysfunctional but also causes abnormal chemical reaction and normal heat generation, which give rise to a problem with a safety of the battery and also a possible deterioration in cyclic characteristic of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to suppress the crystal growth of dendrite on the surface of the lithium metal, a uniform distribution of lithium ions over the surface of the negative electrode is effective. In order to obtain such a desirable uniform distribution of lithium ions, it is effective to provide a layer which has a uniform lithium ion concentration on an interface between the lithium metal of the negative electrode and the electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it was in the past proposed for suppressing the dendrite growth that the lithium metal is mixed with other metal such as aluminum, bismuth, lead, or indium to form an alloy, or that an oxide layer is formed on the surface of the lithium metal of the negative electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above conventional proposals are, however, disadvantageous in lower operational voltage and lower energy density as compared to when the negative electrode comprises the lithium metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, alternatively, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 7-296812 discloses that in place of a lithium metal foil, an amorphous lithium layer or an amorphous lithium alloy layer is formed on the surface of the negative electrode, wherein the amorphous layer makes it difficult to form active points such as crystal grains serving as singular points for the growth of the dendrite crystal. It was, however, confirmed that the formation of the amorphous layer is insufficient for obtaining desirable performances and characteristics of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 6-36800 discloses that a porous insulating film is evaporated on the lithium metal negative electrode. It was, however, confirmed that the formation of the porous insulating film makes it difficult to control the uniform thickness of the porous insulating film and also control distribution of the lithium ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still more, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2001-076710 discloses that a semiconductor film is formed on the metal, wherein the semiconductor film is in contact with the electrolyte. An undesirable reduction reaction is caused with decomposing the electrolyte with the electron conductivity such as tetracyanoquinodimethane. This makes it difficult to keep a high efficiency for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet more, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 59-31570 discloses a solid state thin film lithium secondary battery which includes a lithium-containing solid state electrolyte thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 5-266894 discloses a battery having such a lamination structure that a solid-state electrolyte layer is sandwiched between negative and positive electrode layers, each of which includes a lithium metal or a lithium alloy as active material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 6-223820 discloses a lithium secondary battery having a lithium-ion conductive polymer film formed on the surface of the lithium electrode by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 6-290773 discloses an amorphous lithium metal layer formed on the surface of the negative electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also, Journal of Electrochem. Society vol. 143, p 3208, (1996) discloses a glass-state electrolyte formed on the lithium metal by a vacuum evaporation. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,765 discloses the formation of the glass-state electrolyte on the lithium metal by the vacuum evaporation. These conventional techniques are, however, disadvantageous in that a non-uniform oxide film on the surface of the lithium metal makes it difficult to obtain a desirable uniformity of the glass-state electrolyte film on the lithium metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, Japanese laid-open patent publications Nos. 9-199180 and 10-144295 disclose evaporation of lithium on a carbon plate. These conventional techniques are, however, disadvantageous in that carbon itself is the irreversible capacitive component and has sites reactive to lithium, resulting in an undesirable unstability of the lithium metal on the carbon plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the above circumstances, the development of a novel lithium secondary battery and a novel method of forming the same free from the above problems is desirable. </paragraph>

If the thickness of the lithium-ion-supporting layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is less than 0.1 micrometer, then the lithium-ion-supporting layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has an insufficient capability of supporting lithium ions. If the thickness of the lithium-ion-supporting layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is more than 20 micrometers, then this results in a large resistance of the negative electrode. </paragraph>

A preferable thickness of the amorphous-state lithium-based metal layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be ranged from 1 micrometer to 30 micrometers. If the thickness of the amorphous-state lithium-based metal layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is less than 1 micrometer, then the quantity of the lithium metal as active material of the negative electrode is insufficient.
