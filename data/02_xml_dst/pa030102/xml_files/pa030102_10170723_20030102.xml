<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a printhead, head cartridge having said printhead, printing apparatus using said printhead and printhead element substrate, and more particularly, to a printhead having a plurality of printing elements and a drive circuit for driving the printing elements are aligned in a predetermined direction on an element board, a head cartridge having such a printhead, a printing apparatus using such a printhead, and a printhead substrate. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a printing apparatus used as an information output device for a word processor, personal computer or facsimile network and the like to print desired text or image information on paper, film or some other sheet-like printing medium, a serial printing method is in general and widespread use due to its inexpensiveness and ability to be made compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a description will now be given of the composition of the printhead used in such a printing apparatus, using the example of a printhead that follows the ink jet method that uses thermal energy to print For the printing element, this type of ink jet printhead provides heating elements, or heaters, at that portion of the head that is continuous with the nozzles that actually discharge the drops of ink. An electric current is then applied to the heaters, causing the heaters to boil the ink and forcing ink drops through the nozzles by the expansion of the bubbles formed in the ink when boiled. This type of printhead easily accommodates compact, high-density arrangements of nozzles and heaters, by means of which high-definition printing images can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The heater board of the printhead of a printer that uses heaters for the heating element is supplied with power from the printer main unit by two power supply systems: a 10-30V, high-voltage power supply for driving the heaters, and a 5V power supply for the logic circuits that control the driving of the heaters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The heater power source VH, together with the signal supplied to the logic circuit, is connected to the heater board from the printer via flexible substrate wiring that connects the main unit and the carriage, a contact pad (connection terminal) on the carriage that connects to the head and tab wiring inside the printhead. The wiring and contact pads have resistance, inductance and capacitance impedance components, so fluctuations in current as the heater turns ON and OFF causes large, precipitous fluctuations in the heater power source VH voltage. This voltage fluctuation is superimposed on the logic signal via the flexible substrate wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent faulty operation of the heater board logic circuit due to the effects of noise mixed in with the logic signal, the input part of the logic circuit is provided with a Schmitt trigger that gives the threshold voltage for discriminating between high level and low-level logic signals a hysteresis property as between the rising wave form and the falling wave form of the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the circuit structure of a heater board of a typical ink jet printhead. From the printer main unit, a heater drive signal HE, latch signal LT, clock signal CLK and data signal DATA, respectively, are input from respective contact pads <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The data signal DATA is synchronized with the clock signal CLK and input into a shift register, and is held in a latch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> with the input of the latch signal LT. The logical product of the output from the latch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and the heater drive signal (HE) is ANDED by an AND circuit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and depending on that output the drive element <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is turned ON via a buffer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and a heater <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is activated (that is, driven). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an ink jet printhead heater board circuit, a Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is provided between each of the signal contact pads <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and buffers <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. The Schmitt trigger used in this type of circuit may be that which is described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 08-039809. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given of the operation of a Schmitt trigger with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, in a case in which the supply voltage Vdd is 5 V and the signal wave form rising and falling threshold voltages are 3.5 V and 1.5 V, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> are diagrams illustrating a Schmitt trigger and the operating characteristics thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, reference numeral <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> denotes a MOS inverter with a threshold of 3.5 V (that is, 70% of the supply voltage Vdd), reference numeral 101 denotes a MOS inverter with a threshold of 1.5 V (that is, 30% of the supply voltage Vdd) and reference numeral <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> denotes a MOS inverter with a threshold of 2.5 V (that is, 50% of the supply voltage Vdd). Reference numerals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are NAND circuits, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The input-output characteristics of this circuit are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, in which, when a signal indicated by dotted line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is input, a flip-flop composed of NAND circuits <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is initially reset and the output signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is LOW. Then, when the input signal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> exceeds 0.7 Vdd, the inverter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> output becomes LOW, the NAND circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> output becomes HIGH and the output signal <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is HIGH. Next, when the input signal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> voltage drops and the electric potential falls below 0.3 Vdd, the inverter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> output inverts and switches to HIGH and the NAND circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> output inverts to LOW, making the output signal <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> LOW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given of the composition of a signal that changes the threshold values of the MOS inverters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the layout of a MOS inverter. As shown in the diagram, the L and W show the length and width, respectively, of the MOS-construction FET gate. Additionally, reference numeral <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> denotes an input signal line input from the pad and reference numeral <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> denotes the output signal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a typical MOS inverter, the ON resistance of the PMOS and NMOS is practically identical, and designed so that the threshold is a central 0.5 Vdd. By changing the length L and width W of the gate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the channel resistance value can be increased or decreased. Accordingly, with respect to the inverter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the length and width of the gate is set so that the ON resistance (NMOS) is greater than the ON resistance (PMOS), and with respect to the inverter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the length and width of the gate is set so that the ON resistance (NMOS) is less than the ON resistance (PMOS). As a result, as shown by the hysteresis characteristic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, inverter circuits of different threshold values can be formed on the same heater board by any common logic circuit production process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given of the Schmitt trigger having hysteresis characteristics and formed by using two inverters of different thresholds as described above, with reference once again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> denotes an input pad and P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> denote points for indicating a voltage or a logic level. When the electric potential of the signal input from the input pad <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> changes from 0 V to 1.5 V, because the inverter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> input signal threshold is 1.5 V the electric potential at point P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> changes from HIGH to LOW and the electric potential at point P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also changes from LOW to HIGH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, when the electric potential of the signal input from the input pad <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> changes from 1.5 V to 3.5 V, because the inverter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> input threshold is 3.5 V the inverter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> output inverts and the electric potential at point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes LOW. As a result, the NAND circuit output (P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) electric potential level inverts to HIGH. Thus it is clear that the output P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes HIGH only after the input signal electric potential is 3.5 V. In this state, the output signal level is maintained even if the electric potential at the input pad rises further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> If the electric potential of the signal input from the input pad <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> falls from 5 V to 0 V, then the inverter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with an input threshold of 3.5 V inverts before the inverter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> when the electric potential of 3.5 V at point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, however, because the electric potential at point P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is LOW there is no impact from the output P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Then, when the electric potential at the input pad falls to 1.5 V, the inverter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> inverts, the output (point P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of that inverter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes HIGH, the point P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> electric potential becomes LOW and the output P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> changes to LOW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As described above, by giving the printhead heater board input signal a hysteresis characteristic, a hysteresis characteristic with a higher noise margin can be obtained in which the input signal level can rise to 3.5 V without the output inverting when the input signal is LOW (0 V) and the input signal can fall to 1.5 V or less without the output inverting when the input signal is HIGH (3.5 V or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, a parallel interface is usually used for the conventional printer interface. In that case, a voltage of 5 V is used as the power source for the logic circuitry of the printer main unit, and that 5 volts is also used to supply power to the logic circuitry of the ink jet printhead substrate inside the head. Additionally, a portion of the integrated circuits of the printer&apos;s internal circuitry also requires a power supply of 5 V, which is one reason the logic voltage of the ink jet printhead substrate has been designed to be 5 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, recently, improvement sin the miniaturization technologies that lay down IC design rules and the adoption of new interfaces have made the use of a 5 V printer main unit power supply increasingly impractical in terms of cost and size. It is for this reason that there have been moves afoot to adopt 3.3 V as the mainstream printer main unit logic supply voltage. Nevertheless, it has been established that reducing the head substrate logic supply voltage from the proven 5 V to 3.3 V creates a number of problems, which are described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an example of the structure of the substrate (hereinafter also referred to as an &ldquo;element board&rdquo;) used for a typical ink jet printhead. In the diagram, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> is a pad fore receiving an external signal. As shown in the diagram, the pad <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> includes a VDD terminal <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> for receiving a logic supply voltage, a VH terminal <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> for receiving a heater drive supply voltage, a GNDH terminal <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> that is grounded, and a VSS terminal <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight>. Additionally, as shown in the diagram, a shift register logic circuit <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> for receiving image data serially and outputting such data in parallel, a driver <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> for driving a heater and a heater <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> are arranged on a single silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A case involving formation of a 620-bit heater is depicted in further detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram of </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in the diagram, the 620-bit heater is designed so as to drive a maximum of 40 bits simultaneously, repeated 16 times so as to drive all of the 620-bit heaters (in one cycle). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a drive timing chart for an ink jet printhead. A description will now be given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the speed required to send image data when driving all 620 bits, where the drive frequency required to carry out constant high-speed printing is 15 kHz (existing equipment will suffice for this purpose). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A drive frequency of 15 kHz results in a period (cycle) of 66.67 &mgr;S, within which 40 bits of image data must be sent in 16 blocks, which means that the image data transmission speed must be at least 12 MHz or more. This transmission speed is not large when considered within the context of the capabilities of an ordinary CPU, but in the case of an ink jet printhead, the fact that the working carriage and the main unit are connected by a long, flexible element board and that printers themselves have become smaller requires the carriage to be made more compact as well. As a result, the 12 MHZ figure is by no means a small one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A description of the reduction in transmission capacity when the logic supply voltage is reduced from V to 3.3 V will now be given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> are diagrams showing logic supply voltages versus image data transmission-capable maximum clock frequencies and element board temperature versus image data transmission-capable maximum clock frequencies, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in the diagrams, as the logic signal supply voltage drops the clock frequency declines, because the drive performance of the MOS transistor used for the shift register part and the clock and other input circuitry for performing image data transmission declines simultaneously with the decline in the logic supply voltage used as is as the gate voltage of the CMOS. As can be understood from the diagrams, the drop in gate voltage causes the drive performance (that is, the drain current Id to decline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, driving the heaters on the element board of the ink jet printhead imposes thermal requirements on top of speed requirements. These added thermal requirements are specific to ink jet printhead substrates. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the performance of the ink jet printhead declines as the temperature of the element board increases together with the decline in capacity attendant upon use if a 3.3 V power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it is clear that the performance must be enhanced with the 3.3 V arrangement, in a way that was not an issue for the conventional 5 V, 12 MHz clock frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a further description will now be given of the cause of the above-described decline in image data transmission capacity with a Schmitt trigger as the voltage is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As the power supply voltage is lowered, the gate voltage that drives the MOS transistor that composes the logic circuit also declines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a graph showing the relation between drain current (I<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>) and drain-source voltage (V<highlight><subscript>ds</subscript></highlight>) in a MOS transistor when the gate voltage (V<highlight><subscript>gs</subscript></highlight>) is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the gate voltage (V<highlight><subscript>gs</subscript></highlight>) drops from 5 V to 3.3 V, the transistor current drive capacity declines by over half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the gate capacity load added to the inverter output when a CMOS inverter is used to drive a MOS transistor gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If a MOS transistor gate is driven with a CMOS inverter as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, then in effect the gate capacity load is added to the inverter output. If the MOS ON resistance is RMOS and the equivalent load capacity is C<highlight><subscript>gate</subscript></highlight>, then the delay time constant from the time the inverter input changes to the time the output inverts is C<highlight><subscript>gate </subscript></highlight>X RMOS. Lowering the supply voltage without changing the load more than doubles the RMOS, and thus also more than doubles the delay time constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the Schmitt trigger depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, from input of the Schmitt trigger to output, the number of steps of the operating inverter differs between the rising wave form and the falling wave form, and it is for this reason that the delay time of the inverters increases as the voltage is lowered, which in turn causes the length of the delay of the Schmitt trigger with respect to the input wave form rising edge and falling edge to differ from the conventional delay by as much as a factor of two or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the supply voltage is 5 V the ON resistances are sufficiently small that the difference between the rising delay and the falling delay is minor and can be ignored. However, reducing the supply voltage also reduces the drive gate voltage in an MOS transistor, increasing the ON resistance and, as a result, increasing the difference in the extent of the rising delay and the falling delay to the point where the difference can no longer be ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A difference in the delay between the rising edge and the falling edge of an input wave form in a Schmitt trigger leads to the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a Schmitt trigger signal wave form in which a delay is imposed at the rising and falling edges of an input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in the diagram, the input signal wave form is indicated by a solid line and the shift register wave form is indicated by a dashed line. As is clear from the solid line indicating the input signal wave form, the set-up time and the hold time that comprise the margin of DATA change with respect to changes in the CLK is the same for the input wave form. However, as shown by the dashed line indicating the shift register wave form, a wave form that has passed through a Schmitt trigger has a reduced set-up time and hold time as compared to those of the input wave form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the set-up time and the hold time margins decrease at the shift register input as described above, reliable data acquisition becomes problematic, which can cause malfunctions. Additionally, it becomes difficult to increase the clock frequency and carry out high-speed data acquisition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the heater board is a part of the printhead which is an expendable component, so it is used in common in a wide variety of printers and existing layouts. As a result, circuit configurations have been studied extensively in terms of reducing costs and streamlining manufacturing, that is, standardizing the product. Accordingly, adding a new component as a result of lowering the supply voltage imposes not only a requirement to not complicate the manufacturing process but also a requirement to study such an addition carefully in order to not upset the overall balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Moreover, recent demands for and improvements in printer printing speed and printing resolution continue to grow apace, with the result that consumers still require improved printing speed even with a lowered supply voltage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention was developed in order to solve the problems of the conventional art described above, and has as its object to provide a printhead that, when operating with a lowered supply voltage, can reduce the difference in delay between the rising edge and the falling edge of an input wave form between the input and output of a Schmitt trigger and can accommodate high-speed data transmission, while imposing no additional manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a head cartridge adapted to use the above-described printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Another and further object of the present invention is to provide a printing apparatus that uses the above-described printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Still another and further object of the present invention is to provide a printhead element substrate that reduces the difference in delay at the rising edge and the falling edge of a given input wave form at the Schmitt trigger between input and output without increasing manufacturing costs when the supply voltage is lowered, and can accommodate high-speed data transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The above-described objects of the present invention are achieved by a printhead in which a plurality of printing elements and a drive circuit for driving the printing elements are provided on a single element substrate, the printhead comprising a Schmitt trigger having hysteresis characteristics that cause a threshold value for a rising edge of a wave form of a logic signal input into the drive circuit and a threshold value of a falling edge of a wave form of a logic signal input into the drive circuit to be different, and delay adjustment means for adjusting a length of a delay at the rising edge and a length of a delay at the falling edge occurring when the threshold values of the rising edge and the falling edge of the input signal wave form differ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the above-described objects of the present invention are achieved by a head cartridge comprising the printhead as described above, and an ink tank adapted to hold ink to be supplied to the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the above-described objects of the present invention are achieved by a printing apparatus comprising the printhead described above, wherein the printing apparatus performs printing using the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the above-described objects of the present invention are achieved by a printhead element substrate, in which a plurality of printing elements and a drive circuit for driving the printing elements are provided on a single element substrate, the printhead element substrate comprising a Schmitt trigger having hysteresis characteristics that cause a threshold value for a rising edge of a wave form of a logic signal input into the drive circuit and a threshold value of a falling edge of a wave form of a logic signal input into the drive circuit to be different, and delay adjustment means for matching a length of a delay at the rising edge and a length of a delay at the falling edge occurring inside the Schmitt trigger at the rising edge and the logic signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the present invention, the delays at the rising and falling edges of the input wave form of the logic signals input to the drive circuit is adjusted at the Schmitt trigger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By so doing, the two delays can be made substantially identical, so the speed of data transmission to the printhead can be increased even as the supply voltage is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that it is preferable that the data be read at the rising and falling edges of the logic signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In such cases, the logic signals consist of at least a clock signal and a data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Optimally, the delay adjustment means is provided inside the Schmitt trigger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that a Schmitt trigger be provided for each logic signal to be input to the drive circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In such a case, the Schmitt trigger may be configured so that the number of elements along the path traversed by the rising edge of the logic signal and the number of elements provided along the path traversed by the falling edge of the logic signal is different, with the delay adjustment means being provided along the path of fewer elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the Schmitt trigger may be configured so that the number of inverters included in the path traversed by the falling edge of the logic signal is greater than the number of inverters included in the path traversed by the rising edge of the logic signal, and the delay adjustment means is provided along the path traversed by the rising edge of the logic signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the Schmitt trigger may be configured so that the number of inverters included in the path traversed by the falling edge of the logic signal is greater than the number of inverters included in the path traversed by the rising edge of the logic signal, and the length of the delay at a rising edge of the wave form logic signal and the length of the delay at the falling edge of the wave form logic signal is adjusted by adjusting an ON resistance of at least one inverter included in one path or the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the length of the delay at the rising edge and the length of the delay at the falling edge are adjusted to be substantially identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention besides those discussed above shall be apparent to those skilled in the art from the description of a preferred embodiment of the invention which follows. In the description, reference is made to accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof, and which illustrate an example of the invention.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the following embodiments, a printer is described as an example of a printing apparatus using an ink-jet system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In this specification, &ldquo;print&rdquo; is not only to form significant information such as characters and graphics, but also to form, e.g., images, figures, and patterns on printing media in a broad sense, regardless of whether the information formed is significant or insignificant or whether the information formed is visualized so that a human can visually perceive it, or to process printing media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Print media&rdquo; are any media capable of receiving ink, such as cloth, plastic films, metal plates, glass, ceramics, wood, and leather, as well as paper sheets used in common printing apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, &ldquo;ink&rdquo; (to be also referred to as a &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; hereinafter) should be broadly interpreted like the definition of &ldquo;print&rdquo; described above. That is, ink is a liquid which is applied onto a printing medium and thereby can be used to form images, figures, and patterns, to process the printing medium, or to process ink (e.g., to solidify or insolubilize a colorant in ink applied to a printing medium). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; (to be also referred to as an &ldquo;element board&rdquo; hereinafter) includes not only a base plate made of a silicon semiconductor but also a base plate bearing elements and wiring lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The following expression &ldquo;on a substrate&rdquo; means &ldquo;the surface of a substrate&rdquo; or &ldquo;the inside of a substrate near its surface&rdquo; in addition to &ldquo;on a substrate&rdquo;. &ldquo;Built-in&rdquo; in the present invention does not represent a simple layout of separate elements on a base, but represents integral formation/manufacture of elements on a substrate by a semiconductor circuit manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a general description will first be given of the structure of a typical ink jet printer using the printhead according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> &lt;Brief Description of a Printing Apparatus&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the outer appearance of an ink-jet printer IJRA as a typical embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> carriage HC engages with a spiral groove <highlight><bold>5004</bold></highlight> of a lead screw <highlight><bold>5005</bold></highlight>, which rotates via driving force transmission gears <highlight><bold>5009</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5011</bold></highlight> upon forward/reverse rotation of a drive motor <highlight><bold>5013</bold></highlight>. The carriage HC has a pin (not shown), and is reciprocally moved in directions of arrows <highlight><uline>a</uline></highlight> and <highlight><uline>b</uline></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. An integrated ink-jet cartridge IJC which incorporates a printing head IJH and an ink tank IT is mounted on the carriage HC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>5002</bold></highlight> denotes a sheet pressing plate, which presses a paper sheet against a platen <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>, ranging from one end to the other end of the scanning path of the carriage. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>5007</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5008</bold></highlight> denote photocouplers which serve as a home position detector for recognizing the presence of a lever <highlight><bold>5006</bold></highlight> of the carriage in a corresponding region, and used for switching, e.g., the rotating direction of motor <highlight><bold>5013</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>5016</bold></highlight> denotes a member for supporting a cap member <highlight><bold>5022</bold></highlight>, which caps the front surface of the printing head IJH; and <highlight><bold>5015</bold></highlight>, a suction device for sucking ink residue through the interior of the cap member. The suction device <highlight><bold>5015</bold></highlight> performs suction recovery of the printing head via an opening <highlight><bold>5023</bold></highlight> of the cap member <highlight><bold>5015</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>5017</bold></highlight> denotes a cleaning blade; <highlight><bold>5019</bold></highlight>, a member which allows the blade to be movable in the back-and-forth direction of the blade. These members are supported on a main unit support plate <highlight><bold>5018</bold></highlight>. The shape of the blade is not limited to that shown, and a known cleaning blade can be used in this embodiment instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>5021</bold></highlight> denotes a lever for initiating a suction operation in the suction recovery operation. The lever <highlight><bold>5021</bold></highlight> moves upon movement of a cam <highlight><bold>5020</bold></highlight>, which engages with the carriage, and receives a driving force from the driving motor via a known transmission mechanism such as clutch switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The capping, cleaning, and suction recovery operations are performed at their corresponding positions upon operation of the lead screw <highlight><bold>5005</bold></highlight> when the carriage reaches the home-position side region. However, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement, as long as desired operations are performed at known timings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of a Control Arrangement&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Next, the control structure for performing the printing control of the above apparatus is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the arrangement of a control circuit of the ink-jet printer. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> showing the control circuit, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> denotes an interface for inputting a print signal from an external unit such as a host computer; <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>, an MPU; <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, a ROM for storing a control program (including character fonts if necessary) executed by the MPU <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>; and <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>, a DRAM for storing various data (the print signal, print data supplied to the printing head and the like). Reference numeral <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> denotes a gate array (G. A.) for performing supply control of print data to the printing head IJH. The gate array <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> also performs data transfer control among the interface <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>, the MPU <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>, and the RAM <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> denotes a carrier motor for transferring the printing head IJH in the main scanning direction; and <highlight><bold>1709</bold></highlight>, a transfer motor for transferring a paper sheet. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> denotes a head driver for driving the printing head; and <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1707</bold></highlight>, motor drivers for driving the transfer motor <highlight><bold>1709</bold></highlight> and the carrier motor <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The operation of the above control arrangement will be described below. When a print signal is inputted into the interface <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>, the print signal is converted into print data for a printing operation between the gate array <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> and the MPU <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>. The motor drivers <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1707</bold></highlight> are driven, and the printing head is driven in accordance with the print data supplied to the head driver <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight>, thus performing the printing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Though the control program executed by the MPU <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> is stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, an arrangement can be adopted in which a writable storage medium such as an EEPROM is additionally provided so that the control program can be altered from a host computer connected to the ink-jet printer IJRA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Note that the ink tank IT and the printing head IJH are integrally formed to construct an exchangeable ink cartridge IJC, however, the ink tank IT and the printing head IJH may be separately formed such that when ink is exhausted, only the ink tank IT can be exchanged for new ink tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Ink Cartridge&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the structure of the ink cartridge IJC where the ink tank and the head can be separated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> in the ink cartridge ITC, the ink tank IT and the printing head IJH can be separated along a line K. The ink cartridge IJC has an electrode (not shown) for receiving an electric signal supplied from the carriage HC side when it is mounted on the carriage HC. By the electric signal, the printing head IJH is driven as above, and discharges ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Note that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, numeral <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> denotes an ink-discharge orifice array. Further, the ink tank IT has a fiber or porous ink absorbing body. The ink is held by the ink absorbing body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Printhead&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given of embodiments of an ink jet printer printhead having the structure described above, with reference to the Schmitt trigger and other circuitry disposed on the substrate (element board). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that a member that forms a flow path continuous with ink discharge orifices that correspond to the printing elements is provided on the substrate, together with ink discharge orifices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The ink that is supplied to these printing elements is then heated by the driving of the printing elements so as to form air bubbles in the surface of the ink, thus discharging the ink from the ink discharge orifices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the above-described case, it is not necessary to adjust both values R<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&prime; and R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&prime;. Rather, it is sufficient to adjust one of these two values so as to satisfy equation (9). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the Schmitt trigger of the present embodiment has essentially the same composition as the conventional Schmitt trigger, and thus can be formed on the heater board using conventional manufacturing techniques, which means that no additional costs are incurred in production of the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> &lt;Other Embodiments&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Each of the embodiments described above has exemplified a printer, which comprises means (e.g., an electrothermal transducer, laser beam generator, and the like) for generating heat energy as energy utilized upon execution of ink discharge, and causes a change in state of an ink by the heat energy, among the ink-jet printers. According to this ink-jet printer and printing method, a high-density, high-precision printing operation can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> As the typical arrangement and principle of the ink-jet printing system, one practiced by use of the basic principle disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,723,129 and 4,740,796 is preferable. The above system is applicable to either one of so-called an on-demand type and a continuous type. Particularly, in the case of the on-demand type, the system is effective because, by applying at least one driving signal, which corresponds to printing information and gives a rapid temperature rise exceeding nucleate boiling, to each of electrothermal transducers arranged in correspondence with a sheet or liquid channels holding a liquid (ink), heat energy is generated by the electrothermal transducer to effect film boiling on the heat acting surface of the printhead, and consequently, a bubble can be formed in the liquid (ink) in one-to-one correspondence with the driving signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> By discharging the liquid (ink) through a discharge opening by growth and shrinkage of the bubble, at least one droplet is formed. If the driving signal is applied as a pulse signal, the growth and shrinkage of the bubble can be attained instantly and adequately to achieve discharge of the liquid (ink) with the particularly high response characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As the pulse driving signal, signals disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,463,359 and 4,345,262 are suitable. Note that further excellent printing can be performed by using the conditions described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,124 of the invention which relates to the temperature rise rate of the heat acting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> As an arrangement of the printhead, in addition to the arrangement as a combination of discharge nozzles, liquid channels, and electrothermal transducers (linear liquid channels or right angle liquid channels) as disclosed in the above specifications, the arrangement using U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,558,333 and 4,459,600, which disclose the arrangement having a heat acting portion arranged in a flexed region is also included in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as a full line type printhead having a length corresponding to the width of a maximum printing medium which can be printed by the printer, either the arrangement which satisfies the full-line length by combining a plurality of printheads as disclosed in the above specification or the arrangement as a single printhead obtained by forming printheads integrally can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In addition, not only an exchangeable chip type printhead, as described in the above embodiment, which can be electrically connected to the apparatus main unit and can receive an ink from the apparatus main unit upon being mounted on the apparatus main unit but also a cartridge type printhead in which an ink tank is integrally arranged on the printhead itself can be applicable to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as a printing mode of the printer, not only a printing mode using only a primary color such as black or the like, but also at least one of a multi-color mode using a plurality of different colors or a full-color mode achieved by color mixing can be implemented in the printer either by using an integrated printhead or by combining a plurality of printheads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be applied to a system constituted by a plurality of devices (e.g., host computer, interface, reader, printer) or to an apparatus comprising a single device (e.g., copying machine, facsimile machine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific preferred embodiments described above thereof except as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
