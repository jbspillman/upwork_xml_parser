<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of devices for use with a laundering process, and, more particularly, to the field of laundry devices for storing dye transfer inhibiting compounds. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The laundering of colored garments is a delicate operation. Dye bleeding from fabrics and dye transfer between fabrics during the laundering process can lead to the undesirable result of color alteration of the laundered garments. The use of dye transfer inhibiting (DTI) compounds is known in the art as a means for reducing the effects of dye transfer between laundered articles. These DTI compounds, which can be provided in the form of polymers, have the ability to complex or absorb the fugitive dyes washed out of fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to attach to other articles in the wash. Some DTI compounds include vinylpyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers and copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole. These polymers can be water soluble or substantially water insoluble, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,221 issued to Van Leeuwen et al. on Jun. 15, 1999, the substance of which is fully incorporated herein by reference, and can be added directly to the wash water if desired. However, when too much of a DTI compound is present in the wash water, it can negate the effectiveness of laundry brighteners or fluorescent whitening agents as well as negatively impact the cleaning performance of a laundry detergent. Excessive amounts of a DTI compound in the wash water may also cause deterioration of non-extraneous dyes present on the items being laundered. In other words, even dyes that do not ordinarily give rise to bleeding in the wash water can be attacked by a DTI compound, resulting in faded or non-uniform appearances of the laundered items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is also known in the art to chemically bond dye scavenging compounds to a substrate, such as by covalently bonding a polyquaternary ammonium compound to a cellulosic material as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,881,412 to Ziskind. U.S. Pat. No. 4,380,453 to Claiborne also describes an article impregnated with a dye scavenging compound. In practice, however, it has been determined that the above-described dye-scavenging approach requires an impractical size for the substrate to reduce bleeding to manageable or even acceptable levels, and is restrictive in terms of possible substrate candidates that are compatible with the dye scavenging compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Yet another approach taken to reduce dye transfer during a wash process is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,494,264 to Wattiez et al., wherein articles subject to dye bleeding are physically separated from the remaining laundry articles by an envelope. This approach, however, can suffer from the inconvenience of having to sort items into a confining laundry envelope, resulting in decreased cleaning due to restricted movement of the enveloped items through the wash water. In addition, this approach does not appear to provide a mechanism for restricting dye transfer among the articles within the envelope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a desire to provide methods and devices for delivering dye transfer inhibiting benefits with a simplified laundry device. Further, there is a desire to provide a laundry device which eliminates contact between the laundered articles and the DTI compound. Yet further, there is a desire to provide a laundry device which can deliver DTI benefits as well as dispense a laundry detergent. Still yet further, there is a desire to provide a laundry device which can deliver DTI benefits, wherein the DTI compound can be replaced so that the laundry device is useable over multiple washing cycles. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Unless specifically indicated otherwise, those figures expressed in terms of percent (%) are understood to refer to weight-percent. Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like numerals indicate the same elements throughout the views and wherein reference numerals having the same last two digits (e.g., 20 and 120) connote similar elements. As discussed more fully hereafter, the present invention is directed to water permeable laundry devices having a water-insoluble dye transfer inhibiting (DTI) compound stored therein, and, more preferably, to laundry devices for dispensing laundry products, such as liquid, tablet, or powder detergents, and which further include a replaceable bag having a water-insoluble DTI compound stored therein. The laundry devices of the present invention can be used with any type of automatic washing machine, including washing machines with and without an agitator. Further, the laundry devices can freely float within the wash volume of the washing machine or can be fixedly attached to the interior of the washing machine tub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a preferred laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> storing a water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and a retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is substantially annular in shape and includes an opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a plurality of feet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which provide a stable platform for the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when it is placed upon a surface. The frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a radially extending ledge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located adjacent to the opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An inner wall <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> depends downwardly from the ledge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and has a female thread <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> disposed thereabout. The connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided in the form of a ring having, in addition to the male thread <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> disposed about the outer surface of the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a female thread <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> disposed about the inner surface of the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for engaging a male thread <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a radially outwardly extending flange <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>which engages the ledge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> when the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is assembled. The connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a radially inward extending lip <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with one or more concentric ridges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> disposed about the upper surface of the lip <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. When the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is assembled, an extension <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed between the ridges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a one or more ridges <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> disposed on a radially inwardly extending lip <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The combination of and cooperation between the ridges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the ridges <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> secure the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the dosing device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The upper wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably provided in the form of a depression and, more preferably, is substantially hemispherical in shape for receiving a liquid or powder detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) therein. As such, the upper wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a material which is impermeable to the liquid detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyamide films. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the lower wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> through which the laundry wash water can flow but which restrict movement of the water-insoluble DTI particles <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> from the compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the washing volume of a washing machine. While the apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are illustrated as discrete portions of the lower wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for clarity, it will be understood that more or less than the entire lower wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may contain the apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. As used herein, the term &ldquo;apertures&rdquo; is intended to refer to any random or predetermined opening through which the wash water can flow. For example, the apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be randomly formed as part of a non-woven fabric or can be formed as part of predetermined discrete pattern. The apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are sized to prevent the water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> from exiting the compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and preferably have an average aperture open area (i.e., the area through which the wash water can flow) which is less than about 20 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and, more preferably, is between about 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and about 5 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The total open area of the apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the lower wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is at least about 20 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and, more preferably, is between about 50 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and about 500&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. For apertures formed as non-discrete patterns (e.g., such as in a non-woven fabric), the aperture open area can be characterized according to the air permeability of the material forming the wall, as measured by ISO method 9237.

This amount of DTI compound can be sufficient for between about 1 and about 20 uses in a standard wash cycle lasting 10 to 120 minutes. More preferably, the water-insoluble DTI compounds confined in the compartment of the bag of the laundry devices of the present invention, when tested according the Dye Removal Test Method described more fully hereafter, remove at least about 10% of the test dye after 15 wash test cycles and more preferably at least about 25% of the test dye at 15 wash test cycles. Most preferably, the DTI compounds confined in the compartment of the bag of the laundry devices of the present invention remove at least about 50% of the test dye after 15 wash test cycles. The volume of the compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be increased or decreased to accommodate more or less of the water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> as desired. The compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be permanently sealed such that the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is discarded when the DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has become ineffective or the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be fitted with a resealable closure, as known in the art, so that the ineffective DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be emptied from the compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> refilled with new DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is assembled by first positioning the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that the extension <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed over the lip <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is then threadedly advanced into the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> until the lip <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> engages the extension <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such that the grooves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and ridges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> cooperate to secure the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the combination of the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This combination is then threadedly advanced into the opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> until the flange <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> engages the ledge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the liquid laundry detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is poured through the opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and into the depression formed by the inner wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A compartment <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> storing the liquid laundry detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed by a combination of the upper wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The upper wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as well as the inner surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be provided with dosing lines to assist in dispensing predetermined amounts of the laundry detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As will be appreciated, the ridges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, in addition to securing the bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, also provide a substantially liquid tight seal at the bag, connector, and retainer interface so that the liquid laundry detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> does not leak out of the compartment <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and retainer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be formed from a thermoplastic material, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, or nylon, by injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, another preferred laundry device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> made in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The laundry device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> generally in the form of ring and a container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a compartment <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> for storing, for example, the liquid detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> through which the liquid detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is poured into compartment <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. The circumference of the container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> increases in the direction from the opening <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> toward the mid-section of the container. The container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also includes a groove <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> at about the midpoint of the container which cooperates with an elastomeric retaining ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent the opening <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The retaining ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is used to secure the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> about the laundry device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> during use. The inside circumference of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, when the ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in a relaxed state, is preferably less than the smallest circumference of the groove <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The laundry device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is assembled by sliding the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> over the upper portion of the container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> until the retaining ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> cooperates with the groove <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> traverses the upper portion of the container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the opening <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> expands to accommodate the increasing circumference of the container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Because the inside circumference of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> when the ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in a relaxed state is preferably less than the smallest circumference of the groove <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the retaining ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> will be in tension when it engages the groove <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. This force retains the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> about the laundry device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> during use in a washing machine. Some DTI compounds of this invention exhibit the property to swell when exposed to water or to a wash medium. A schematic representation of such swelling is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The swelling can, in some cases, reach 200 to 300% of the volume of the DTI compound in its dry state. For example, polyvinyl N-oxide (PVNO) cross linked by about 0.5% (w/w) of divinylbenzene (DVB) over a DTI monomer can swell up to about 200% of its original volume. Typically, the degree of swelling is related to the degree of cross linking, wherein the greater the degree of cross linking, the lower the amount of swelling which occurs. As such, the dimensions or the material of the bag can be chosen in such a way that the bag can accommodate the swelling of the DTI compound without rupturing. For instance, the inner and/or outer walls <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be made from an elastic material which can accommodate the swelling. Alternately, the volume of the compartment <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be sized to accommodate the swelling of the DTI compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The container <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be formed by injection molding from polyethylene or any other material as is known in the art. The inner and outer walls <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are preferably formed from non-woven, spun-bonded or spun-bonded/melt-blown sandwich polypropylene while the elastomeric ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be formed from any elastomer which is compatible with the liquid detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art. The inner and/or outer walls <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> have a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which allow adequate flow of the wash water into the compartment <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which stores the water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in order to deliver the dye transfer inhibiting benefit. As previously discussed with respect to the laundry device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, however, the apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> retain the water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> within the compartment <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, yet another preferred laundry device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> made in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The laundry device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes a container <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> with a compartment <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> for storing the liquid detergent <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent to the compartment <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> for receiving a bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> having a water-insoluble DTI compound (not illustrated). The chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is preferably closed by a lid <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> attached by a hinge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the container <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> adjacent the opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> further includes a securing mechanism, such as a clip, prong, or other structure known in the art, for releasably securing the lid <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in a closed position to retain the bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> within the chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> during use in a washing machine. The lid <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and/or one or more of the outside walls (i.e., walls which are exposed to the wash water) which form the chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> contain a plurality of slits <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which allow the wash water to flow into and out of the chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so that the bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> can deliver a DTI benefit to the wash water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the laundry devices of the present invention are described herein as comprising a bag in combination with a container which can also dose a laundry detergent to the wash water during use, the bags of the present invention can also be used individually by merely placing the bag directly in the wash water of the washing machine, or by attaching it to the drum or the agitator of the washing machine through mechanical or other means. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> bag <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> having a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and storing a water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> could be placed directly in the wash water. Preferably, the water-insoluble DTI compound <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the bag <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> would comprise a solid cross-linked polyvinyl N-oxide, as discussed more fully hereafter. Bags made in accordance with the present invention which are suitable for use individually can be provided in a variety forms, but will at least contain a compartment for storing a water-insoluble DTI compound and have a plurality of apertures, as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The laundry devices of the present invention can be used with a variety of water-insoluble DTI compounds <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. These water-insoluble DTI compounds can be provided as a solid, gel, and the like. These DTI compounds can deliver the dye transfer inhibiting benefit by a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to trapping the dye in such a manner that it is unavailable for re-deposition onto a fabric, precipitating out the dye or adsorbing, absorbing or otherwise becoming associated with any extraneous dyes in the wash water. As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;substantially water insoluble&rdquo; is intended to mean that the DTI compound has a solubility in deionized water at 20C of less than about 1 gm/liter. A substantially water insoluble DTI compound may comprise a water-soluble dye transfer inhibiting agent which is bound to a water insoluble carrier, or it may comprise a dye transfer inhibiting agent which in itself is water insoluble. Water insoluble carriers for water soluble polymeric agents include inorganic materials such as zeolites, clays such as kaolinites, smectites, hectorite types, silicas (or other detergent ingredients). Additionally, organic water-insoluble materials such as fatty alcohols, esters of fatty acids, or polysaccharides that can form water-insoluble gels upon hydration (e.g. gellan gum, carrageenan gum, agarose etc.) can be used as carriers herein. For the dye transfer inhibiting agents which are themselves water insoluble, water insolubility can be achieved by cross-linking, either starting from the known water soluble dye transfer inhibiting polymeric agents, or starting from monomers of these polymers. Other compounds that are suitable as water insoluble DTI agents are any compound exhibiting ion exchange properties, preferably anion exchangers. For instance, non-limiting examples of such products are Dowex&reg; exchange resins of the Dow Chemical Co. or equivalent from other suppliers; Sephadex&reg;, Sepharose&reg; or Sephacel&reg; exchange resins all from Pharmacia Biotech; any other polysaccharide having ion exchange properties such as modified cellulosics, starches; other derivatives of the wood industry such as wood pulp or lignin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Water soluble polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents that are suitable to be bound to insoluble carriers, or to be made insoluble via cross-linking are those polymers known in the art to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the ability to complex or adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in the wash. Especially suitable polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents are polyamine N-oxide polymers, polymers and copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, vinyloxazolidones, vinylpyridine, vinylpyridine N-oxide, other vinylpyridine derivatives or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>

Preferred cationic polymers are quaternized polyvinylpyridines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Water insolubility can, in the case of non-cross linked polymers, also be achieved by selecting very high molecular weight range, or by copolymerizing, or by varying the degree of oxidation if appropriate, depending on the polymer. Polymers which are water soluble, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,221, may be made insoluble if the molecular weight is increased above 400,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> g) Cross-Linked Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Cross-linked polymers are polymers whose backbone are interconnected to a certain degree; these links can be of chemical or physical nature, possibly with active groups on the backbone or on branches; cross-linked polymers have been described in the Journal of Polymer Science, volume 22, pages 1035-1039. In one embodiment, the cross-linked polymers are made in such a way that they form a three-dimensional rigid structure, which can entrap dyes in the pores formed by the three-dimensional structure. In another embodiment, the cross-linked polymers entrap the dyes by swelling. Such cross-linked polymers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,221. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, a cross-linked polymer has one or more individual molecular chains linked by side branches to adjacent chains. The cross-links can be formed: (a) between already existing linear or branched polymers, (b) during the polymerization of multi-functional monomers, or (c) during the polymerization of dimeric monomers with traces of multi-functional monomers. The cross-linking can also be achieved by various means known in the art. For instance, the cross-links can be formed using radiation, oxidation and curing agents, such as divinylbenzene, epichlorohydrin and the like. Preferably, cross-linked polymers for the purpose of this invention are those obtained by cross-linking a water-soluble dye tranfer inhibiting polymer described above with divinylbenzene (DVB) cross-linking agent during polymerisation of the DTI monomer. Cross-linking degree can be controlled by adjusting the amount of divinylbenzene (DVB) cross-linking agent. Preferably, the degree of cross-linking is between about 0.05% (w/w) of DVB over DTI monomer and about 50% of DVB over DTI monomer and, more preferably, between about 0.05% (w/w) of DVB over DTI monomer and about 25% (w/w) of DVB over DTI monomer. Most preferably, the degree of cross-linking is between about 0.1% (w/w) of DVB over DTI monomer and about 5% (w/w) of DVB over DTI monomer. The cross linking forms DTI compound particles, at least 90% (and more preferably at least about 95%) of which have a minimum diameter as measured by conventional methods for particle size distribution evaluation of at least about 1 &mgr;m, preferably at least about 50 &mgr;m, and more preferably at least about 75 &mgr;m, all as measured in their dry state. Most preferably, the cross linking forms DTI compounds, at least 90% (and more preferably at least about 95%) of which have a minimum diameter as measured by conventional methods for particle size distribution evaluation of between about 1 &mgr;m and about 5 mm, still more preferably between about 50 &mgr;m and about 2500 &mgr;m, and yet still more preferably between about 75 &mgr;m and about 1500 &mgr;m, all as measured in their dry state. Preferably, the cross-linked polymer is a polyamine N-oxide or a quaternized polyamine The skilled in the art may conveniently obtain such compounds by oxidizing or quaternizing cross-linked polyvinylpyridines from Reilly Industries Inc. commercialized under the name Reillex&trade; 402 or Reillex&trade;425 by methods known in the art. For instance, but not exclusively, the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,809 can be used to prepare a polyamine N-oxide of interest from the commercially available compounds given above. An example of quaternized polyamine can also be obtained from Reilly Industries under the commercial name Reillex&trade; HPQ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The laundry devices of the present invention are used in the same manner as conventional laundry dosing and dispensing devices known in the art. In other words, the subject laundry devices (e.g., a bag or a bag in combination with a container storing a laundry product) can be placed directly in the wash water prior to the start of a wash cycle or can be attached or suspended to the interior of a washing machine tub. The laundry devices of the present invention can also be stored within a package, such as a carton, shipping container, or other article of manufacture, having instructions in association therewith for using the laundry device to deliver a dye transfer inhibiting benefit to the wash water.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The pot solution is brought to 300 mL by adding an appropriate amount of demineralized water. To this pot solution is added 1.33&plusmn;0.01 mL. of a solution of direct blue 1 dye at 2.27 mM concentration (&tilde;0.225% w/w). This yields an absorbance as defined by Beer&apos;s law of about 0.70 at 620 nm. A 5 cm wide&times;5 cm long bag, which is made from the subject apertured material (i.e., the apertured material to be tested), containing 1.00&plusmn;0.01 g of the subject water-insoluble DTI compound (i.e., the DTI compound to be tested), is added to the pot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The pot containing the dye solution, the DTI bag and the detergent composition is agitated for 0.50&plusmn;0.02 hours at 40.0&plusmn;2.0&deg; C. in the Launder-O-Meter. After 0.5 hours, the bag is immediately removed and rinsed thoroughly. The pot solution is filtered after cooling to room temperature over a 0.5 &mgr;m filter to remove any matter in suspension and the residual absorbance of the dye solution is measured at 620 nm. Repeat the operation 15 times, using the same bag containing the same DTI compound but using a fresh dye solution aliquot and a fresh detergent dose at each cycle throughout the test. The absorbance values at 620 nm versus the initial absorbance of the untreated dye solution at the same wavelength reflect the ability of the DTI bag to remove the dye from the wash solution over repeated exposure to dye in solution, in the presence of a laundry detergent. Dye removal efficiency is calculated from the following equation:
