<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A semiconductor device is shown and described which includes a metal can that receives a semiconductor die in an interior thereof. The metal can has a recess formed on a top portion thereof. The recess provides rigidity to the top portion of the metal can which allows the wall of the can to be spaced farther apart from the die, thereby providing a much larger open channel which allows for the easier cleaning of flux residue after soldering. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to semiconductor devices and more specifically relates to a semiconductor device of the flip chip variety that permits an increase in the voltage rating of the device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The drive to miniaturization has led to the development of chip-scale or nearly chip-scale semiconductor devices. One variety of such devices includes a can-shaped connector which receives a semiconductor die in its interior and connects to an electrode of the die by a layer of conductive material such as solder or conductive epoxy. The can-shaped connector includes a wall portion which skirts around the die. The wall is closely spaced from the peripheral edges of the die and its electrodes. When such a device is soldered to a board using fluxed solder pastes residual flux is deposited around the soldered joints. When fluxes other than those marketed as &ldquo;no clean&rdquo; products are used for this purpose it is necessary to wash these residuals from under the device to prevent the device from suffering from the formation of corrosion or electrical breakdown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B show examples of known semiconductor devices in which a MOSFET silicon die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having a drain electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on its top surface and source electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and gate electrode (not shown) on its bottom surface, is housed in a conductive metal can <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thus, drain electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is secured, as by soldering or by a conductive adhesive to the interior surface of can <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The rim <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of can <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is spaced from the periphery of die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Optionally, an insulation ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be provided between rim <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and can <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The bottom surface of source electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be coplanar or slightly sub-flush with respect to the bottom of flange <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of rim <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Solder flux residue must be washed out when the package is soldered down to conductive traces on board <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A shallow gap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) between the rim <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the can and the board limits the ability for the cleaning medium to freely flow under the device. Therefore, adequate washing under the device cannot be easily achieved. Also, the close spacing between source electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the interior of rim <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may hinder the washing of the flux residue and may reduce the voltage which can be applied to the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a semiconductor device is desired which allows for the easier washing of the flux residue and higher voltage applications. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, the gap between the periphery of the die and the body of the metal can is increased so that flux residue may be removed more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device according to the present invention includes a metal can which receives in its interior a semiconductor die. The metal can includes a recess formed on its top surface which creates a frame around the semiconductor die. The recess increases the rigidity of the top portion of the can thereby reducing the stress exerted on the die and the die attach material. Due to this increase in the height of the rim of the can and the increased distance between the formed drain contacts, more effective cleaning under the device may be achieved. This in turn results in a device that can be run at higher voltages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> semiconductor device according to the present invention includes metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from copper and may be silver plated. Metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> includes a web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has formed therein recess <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be formed, for example, by stamping. Recess <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a half shear of the top of metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> around die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> semiconductor device according to the present invention includes metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is comprised of a web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and base portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Drain <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is electrically connected by, for example, a layer of solder or conductive epoxy to web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed in web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which forms frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> a around the peripheral edges of die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Optionally, an insulation ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be disposed between frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> a and peripheral edges of die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is spaced from die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and extends downwardly from edges of web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Base portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are spaced around the bottom edge of peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and are coplanar with source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Base portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are electrically connectable to conductive portions (not shown) on board <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, thereby electrically connecting drain <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to conductive portions (not shown) on board <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, base portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extend away from the interior of metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and thus away from die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, base portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be formed to extend in any direction. For example, base portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be oriented in a direction toward the interior of metal can <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, or even vertically directed toward board <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to reduce the footprint of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also includes rim portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is disposed between recess <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Rim portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be extended to increase space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between source electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The increase in distance between source electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> improves creepage and thus allows the package to be used at higher voltages. Also, the increase in space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> permits the improved flushing of flux residue produced while the package is soldered down to board <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The increase in space by extending rim portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be realized because recess <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (or half shear) creates a flange around die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which adds rigidity that could not otherwise be attained by simply increasing the size of web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, the frame formed in web portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has the rigidity of the previously known can while providing a much greater clearance around the edge of the device to permit more reliable cleaning of the flux residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
