<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide a performance setting information transferring system capable of properly transferring, when necessary, desired performance setting information (so called registration data) among a plurality of electronic musical apparatuses interconnected by a communication network without any restrictions on places and use times of the apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electronic musical apparatus having an interface for connecting to a communication network, comprising: a memory; a receiver that receives, from the communication network via the interface, a first performance setting information used for executing musical performance in accordance with a first performance information on the electronic musical apparatus or the other electronic musical apparatus; a controller that controls the received first performance setting information to store into the memory; an input device that inputs a second performance information; and a musical tone generator that generates a musical tone in accordance with the second performance information and the stored first performance setting information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a server connecting to a plurality of electronic musical apparatuses via a communication network, each electronic musical apparatus generating a musical tone in accordance with performance information and performance setting information set for executing musical performance and having an ID number, the server comprising: a memory that stores the performance setting information transmitted from the plurality of electronic musical apparatuses together with the ID number corresponding to the performance setting information; a receiver that receives a request for the performance setting information corresponding to a specified ID number from one electronic musical apparatus; and a replying device that reads, in response to the request, the performance setting information corresponding to the specified ID from the memory and replies the read performance setting information to said one electronic musical apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Performance setting information called registration information is stored in storage means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of an electronic musical apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Tone signal generating means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generates a tone signal in accordance with performance information (event information) and performance setting information. Interface means (I/F <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or I/F <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&plus;another communication terminal) connects a communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the Internet for data transfer. Control means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> controls to access via the interface means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the communication network, to acquire performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus connected to the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to store the acquired performance setting information in the storage means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and to make the tone signal generating means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> generate a tone signal in accordance with the performance information and the stored performance setting information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The performance setting information (registration information) of another electronic musical apparatus such as an electronic musical instrument is acquired via the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the Internet, and a desired tone signal can be generated by using the acquired performance setting information as the tone signal control parameters. If two electronic musical apparatuses are connected by the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, one electronic musical apparatus can acquire the performance setting information of the other electronic musical apparatus without any restrictions on places and performance time. The performance setting information of both the electronic musical apparatuses can be used in various situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, the performance setting information of a master electronic musical apparatus set up in a home or studio may be acquired at a remote place such as the stage of a concert hall via the Internet or the like to obtain the setting state of the master electronic musical apparatus. Conversely, the performance setting information newly edited and set at the remote place such as a concert hall may be transmitted to a home or studio to renew the performance setting information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a remote lessen of music via the network, an electronic musical apparatus of a teacher is used as a master (transmission side) and an electronic musical apparatus of a student is used as a slave (reception side). Registration of the electronic musical apparatus of the teacher can be set to the electronic musical apparatus of the student. Even a novice of an electronic musical apparatus can be taught efficiently. Such efficient teaching can be applied also to a music teaching system connecting the electronic musical instrument of a teacher to the electronic musical apparatus of a student. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> If the teaching is to be applied to a remote lessen system having two electronic musical apparatuses always connected via the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the Internet, it is preferable to connect two electronic musical apparatuses in a point to point (P to P) mode without involvement of a server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The electronic musical apparatus acquires the performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus via a server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected on the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the Internet under the control of the control means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A plurality of electronic musical apparatuses transfer registration information under the control of the control means of the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, two electronic musical apparatuses between which performance setting information is transferred are not required to be always connected to the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the Internet. Loads of CPU can therefore be reduced. The performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus can be acquired via the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> even if the other electronic musical apparatus is not turned on and connected to the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The electronic musical apparatus is provided with an information acquire switch (hot communication switch SS) to be used for acquiring the performance setting information. In response to an operation of the information acquire switch SS, the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is accessed under the control of the control means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to acquire the performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus. The information acquire switch SS functions also as a button for setting the setup state same as that of another predetermined electronic musical apparatus. Even if the information acquire switches SS are operated by a plurality of electronic musical apparatuses, the same setup state can be set to all the electronic musical apparatus at the same time. In the P to P mode, simply by depressing the information acquire switch SS, the latest performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus can be acquired at any time and the same latest setup state can be renewed at a plurality of electronic musical apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the electronic musical apparatus, the control means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can set update time data representative of an update interval of performance setting information. The performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus can be automatically acquired at the interval of the set update time data. Setting suitable for a communication network or use environment can be realized. For example, the interval of the update time data is shortened for a remote lessen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The control means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the electronic musical apparatus can select either a master mode or a slave mode. When the slave mode is selected, the electronic musical apparatus can acquire and store performance setting information of another electronic apparatus, and when the master mode is selected, performance setting information of the electronic musical apparatus is transmitted to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to allow another electronic musical apparatus to use it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected via the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a plurality of electronic musical apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> capable of generating a tone signal in accordance with performance setting information. The storage means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> stores performance setting information received from the plurality of electronic musical apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in correspondence with ID numbers of the electronic musical apparatuses. In response to an access from an electronic musical apparatus and a request for acquiring performance setting information of another electronic musical apparatus corresponding to a designated ID number, the requested performance setting information is read from the storage means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and transmitted back to the electronic musical apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is possible to reliably run a system capable of transferring performance setting information between a plurality of electronic musical apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by using the storage means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> even if two electronic musical apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for transferring the performance setting information are not maintained to be always connected to the communication network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the Internet. The server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can supply the performance setting information of an electronic musical apparatus even if the electronic musical apparatus is not turned on and connected to the communication network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In response to an access from an electronic musical apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a request for searching a destination from which performance setting information can be acquired, list information of electronic musical apparatuses from which the performance setting information can be acquired is transmitted back to the electronic musical apparatus. An ID number of the electronic musical apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored in the storage means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in correspondence with an ID number of another electronic musical apparatus selected from the list information by the electronic musical apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In response to a request for acquiring the performance setting information from the other electronic musical apparatus, the performance setting information of the selected other electronic musical apparatus having the ID number is read from the storage means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and transmitted back to the electronic musical apparatus. Accordingly, a system for transferring performance setting information between remote electronic musical apparatuses via the communication network can flexibly deal with a new electronic musical apparatus and can run smoothly.</paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the one-keyboard type &ldquo;portable keyboard&rdquo; of &ldquo;PK350US&rdquo; has the contents of the performance setting information same as the source performance setting information of the &ldquo;electronic musical instrument data <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are flow charts illustrating the operation of the electronic musical apparatus according to the embodiment. A three-keyboard type electronic musical instrument (electronic organ) is used as the electronic musical apparatus. First, with reference to the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, a panel switch process to be executed by the electronic musical instrument will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This panel switch process starts when the panel switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated in an unrepresented main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> At Step P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> it is checked whether the panel switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated. If not, this panel switch process is terminated immediately to return to the main process, whereas if operated, the flow advances to Step P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At Step P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> it is checked whether the operated panel switch is the hot communication switch SS. If not, at Step P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the process assigned to the operated panel switch is executed to terminate the panel switch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If the operated panel switch is the hot communication switch SS, the flow advances from Step P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Step P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> whereat it is checked whether the hot communication switch SS continues to be depressed for a predetermined time (e.g., two seconds) or longer. If the hot communication switch SS continues to be depressed for the predetermined time or longer, at Step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> the hot communication mode can be set. After the process at Step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is completed, the panel switch process is terminated to return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the hot communication mode setting state at Step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, by operating the panel switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and by referring to the hot communication mode setting window (not shown) displayed on the display <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the following conditions (1) to (5) can be set as described earlier: (1) a master mode or slave mode (with a cursor (arrow) key); (2) an IP address of the server (with a number key or character key); (3) a one-shot mode or continuous mode (with a cursor (arrow) key): (4) an update time interval in the continuous mode (with a number key or character key): and (5) a hot communication level 1, 2, or 3 (with a number key or cursor (arrow) key). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the master mode (1), the electronic musical apparatus becomes a supply side (transmitter) of performance setting information, and in the slave mode (1), the electronic musical apparatus becomes an acquisition side (receiver) of the performance setting information. In the one-shot mode (3), each time the hot communication switch SS is operated, the electronic musical apparatus accesses the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to transmit the performance setting information in the master mode or acquire the performance setting information in the slave mode. In the continuous mode (3), an operation similar to the one-shot mode is performed each time the &ldquo;update time interval in the continuous mode&rdquo; set at (4) lapses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;hot communication level&rdquo; (5) is a level for setting the number of pieces of the performance setting information to be transferred in the hot communication mode. An electronic musical apparatus can set and store a plurality of pieces of performance setting information in accordance with music programs to be played. For example, the electronic organ is provided with sixteen pieces of the performance setting information 1 to 16, and the portable keyboard is provided with six pieces of the performance setting information 1 to 6. If all pieces of the performance setting information are transferred in all cases, the data amount is large and it takes a long time to transfer the data. In order to avoid this, for example, as shown in Table 1, the performance setting information as many as the number of pieces corresponding to the set hot communication level 1, 2, or 3 is transferred.

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> If it is judged at Step T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that the present mode is the slave mode, then at Step T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> the ID number of the electronic musical apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, information indicating the slave mode and the hot communication level are transmitted to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. At the next Step T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the electronic musical apparatus receives the performance setting information from the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and stores it in the predetermined area of RAM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to thereafter terminate the timer interrupt process and return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> An electronic musical apparatus timer interrupt process <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is activated at a predetermined time interval if the conditions of the hot communication mode are in the &ldquo;continuous mode&rdquo;. In this interrupt process, a musical tone signal generation control process is executed in response to a performance information which occurs by manual operation of the main performance operator of the performance operator unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, reading the automatic performance data from RAM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the external storage device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or receiving external performance data from the second communication I/F <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it is checked at the first Step T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whether there is a performance event. If the performance event is not detected, the timer interrupt process <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is immediately terminated to return to the main process, whereas if the performance event is detected, the processes at Step T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and following Steps are executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> At Step T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> it is checked whether the detected performance event corresponds to a performance operation by the upper keyboard. If affirmative, at Step T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the performance setting information corresponding to the upper keyboard as well as the detected upper keyboard performance event data is transmitted to a tone generator channel for the upper keyboard to execute a tone signal generation control process, thereafter terminate the timer interrupt process <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If the performance event is not for the upper keyboard, the flow advances from Step T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to Step T<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> whereat it is checked whether the performance event is a performance operation of the lower keyboard. If affirmative, at Step T<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the performance setting information corresponding to the lower keyboard as well as the detected lower keyboard performance event data is transmitted to a tone generator channel for the lower keyboard to execute a tone signal generation control process, thereafter terminate the timer interrupt process <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> If the performance event detected at Step T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not for the lower keyboard, then the performance event is for the pedal keyboard. Therefore, the flow advances from Step T<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to Step T<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> whereat the performance setting information corresponding to the pedal keyboard as well as the detected pedal keyboard performance event data is transmitted to a tone generator channel for the pedal keyboard to execute a tone signal generation control process, thereafter terminate the timer interrupt process <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is applied to the electronic musical apparatus of the type having data such as &ldquo;electronic musical instrument data <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B and the upper, lower and pedal keyboards each having different performance setting information. If an electronic musical apparatus is of the one-keyboard type having the data such as &ldquo;electronic musical instrument data <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, the process Step T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is executed immediately after Step T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (YES). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> are a flow chart illustrating the response operation to be executed by the server according to the embodiment. This response process is activated during the main process of the server when there is an access from an electronic musical apparatus, e.g., at Step P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) or Step T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). At the first Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> it is checked whether there is an access from an electronic musical apparatus such as an electronic musical instrument. If not, the response process is immediately terminated to return to the main process, whereas if an access is detected, the flow advances to Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> At Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by referring to the information of the electronic musical instrument transmitted at Step P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) or at Step T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), it is checked whether the ID number received from the electronic musical apparatus is already registered. If not registered, the ID number of the electronic musical instrument is input at Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In order to make the user input the ID number, an HTML file including an input window is transmitted to the electronic musical apparatus to make the user input the ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> If it is confirmed at Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that the received ID number is already registered (YES) or if the ID number is input at Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, then at Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> it is checked from the received information whether the present mode is the slave mode or master mode. If the present mode is the master mode (NO), the process for the master mode is executed at Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Namely, the received performance setting information is stored in a &ldquo;source performance setting information&rdquo; storage area corresponding to the received ID number. After this master mode process is executed, the response process is terminated to thereafter return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> If it is judged at Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that the present mode is the slave mode (YES), the flow advances to Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) whereat it is checked whether the &ldquo;destination ID number&rdquo; is already set, i.e., it is checked whether the ID number of the accessing electronic musical apparatus is already set as the &ldquo;destination ID number&rdquo; for the ID number of the electronic musical apparatus which transmitted the performance setting information desired by the accessing electronic musical apparatus. If this setting is not already completed (NO), after the &ldquo;destination ID number&rdquo; is set at Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the flow advances to Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. If this setting is already set (YES), the flow advances directly to Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In setting the &ldquo;destination ID number&rdquo; at Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an HTML file including an input window is transmitted to the electronic musical apparatus such as an electronic musical instrument, and the user of the electronic musical apparatus is prompted to enter the ID number of the source electronic musical apparatus on the input window. In this case, the electronic musical apparatus can request for a list of available performance setting information. If the list of available performance setting information is requested, the server-transmits an HTML file including performance setting information data to the electronic musical apparatus. The performance setting information contains also electronic musical apparatus ID numbers, handle names, and the latest update times. The user is prompted to enter or select the electronic musical apparatus ID number of the transmission source of desired performance setting information. After the source ID number is input or selected, the received ID number of the destination electronic musical apparatus is stored in the &ldquo;destination ID number&rdquo; area corresponding to the input or selected ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> At Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> a slave mode process is executed. Namely, the source performance setting information corresponding to the &ldquo;destination ID number&rdquo; area storing the received ID number is read from the storage device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The read performance setting information is transmitted to the electronic musical apparatus such as an electronic musical instrument. After the slave mode process is executed, the response process is terminated to return to the main process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiment, performance setting information is transferred via the server. Instead, the performance setting information may be transferred directly (without involvement of the server) between two electronic musical apparatuses such as electronic musical instruments in a P to P mode using IP addresses. In this case, the setting of the hot communication mode at Step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) uses new items (6) a direct data transfer (P to P) mode, (7) ID number or numbers of destination electronic musical apparatus or apparatuses, and (8) IP addresses. This P to P mode will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the source ID number and IP address are stored in the server for the slave mode. If data is directly transferred, it is necessary for the electronic musical apparatus on the slave side to store the source ID number and IP address. Therefore, in the setting of the &ldquo;hot communication mode&rdquo; at Step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), the direct data transfer (P to P) mode is set, and the source ID number and IP address are set. If the direct data transfer (P to P) mode is set, the source electronic apparatus is directly accessed by using the source IP address without involving the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this case, the source electronic musical apparatus sets the IP addresses and ID numbers of electronic musical apparatuses from which accesses are permitted. When there is an access from an electronic musical apparatus whose IP address and ID number have already been set, the stored performance setting information is read and transmitted irrespective of whether the mode is the master or slave mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In order to establish communication states of electronic musical apparatuses between which performance setting information is transferred, the system is required to have functions such as apparatus verification, use permission level, and apparatus function matching. For example, for the apparatus verification, the server checks special number trains corresponding to product numbers. For the use permission level, a hot communication level, write permission/inhibition, use apparatus range and the like are determined. For the apparatus matching, an apparatus matching level between two apparatuses is determined from an apparatus matching table. Such information is notified to users. Such functions are required to be provided to each electronic musical apparatus, particularly in the P to P mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments. The invention is not limited only to the above embodiments. It is apparent that various modifications, improvements, combinations, and the like can be made by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
