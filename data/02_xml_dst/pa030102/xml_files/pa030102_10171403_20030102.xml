<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to techniques for noise reduction and has been developed with particular attention paid to the possible use for decoding encoded audio signals, adopting noise-reduction techniques, for example Dolby techniques, such as the Dolby-B technique. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known that digital recording of audio signals, such as music signals, affords numerous advantages during playback. One of the major advantages is the absence, during sound reproduction, of the intrinsic noise of the physical medium on which the audio information is recorded. Since digital recording stores the audio information in the form of numbers, it is possible to recover the same information during playback, hence in a way independent of the playback means. Of course, there exists an intrinsic noise of the digital signal, such as quantization distortion, but it is possible to prove that this noise is in fact inaudible once certain conditions at the level of digital recording are observed. Instead, analog recording requires the audio information to be &ldquo;written&rdquo; in the form of an analog signal. In most cases the reproduction medium is a magnetic tape, which is polarized with a magnetic field determined by the analog signal. In this way, it should be possible to read the same signal during playback by reading the polarization of the tape. Unfortunately a magnetic tape, even if it is of the best quality, in any case presents in regard to an analog playback system a residual level of polarization which can be perceived in the form of a low-level wideband noise also referred to as tape noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, analog audio recording is today widely used for example in the car-radio and cassette-recorder sector. Even though it is possible to record a digital signal on a magnetic tape, there exists a large number of car radios and cassette recorders which are in fact incompatible with, and hence not suited for, reproduction of audio material in a digital format. In addition, there is an enormous amount of audio cassettes recorded in analog format which thus require the availability of analog playback equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the past various noise-reduction systems have been proposed aimed at reducing the effects of tape noise. Such systems usually convert the analog signal into a new one, which is less sensitive to tape noise. This conversion is referred to as &ldquo;encoding&rdquo;. During playback, the encoded signal is not designed to be reproduced as it is, in so far as the encoding process, which is designed to render the signal less sensitive to tape noise, modifies (sometimes to a significant extent) the audio information. For this reason, the encoded signal is normally subjected to a second conversion, which is carried out at the playback stage, referred to as &ldquo;decoding&rdquo;. The decoding operation is designed to reproduce in a dual way, i.e., in a complementary way, the encoding process and to reconstruct the original recorded signal as faithfully as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Clearly, proper decoding can be performed only if the encoding system enables a decoder to be made that is able to reconstruct the original audio signal without error, i.e., exactly counterbalancing the action of the encoder. Otherwise, decoding becomes inherently prone to reconstruction errors. A class of noise-reduction systems that has met with a great deal of success is based on the idea of boosting the audio signal during the encoding process, in particular when the dynamic level is low. In this way, the encoded signal is less sensitive to low-level additional noise, such as precisely tape noise, than is the original audio signal. Decoding implies an action of reduction of the level of the encoded signal, in such a way that the original audio information is restored. Using this technique, any other additional signal superimposed on the encoded signal, such as tape noise, is attenuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since tape noise is predominant at higher frequencies, as in case of compact cassettes, the encoding/decoding process described above can be performed only where these frequency components are present, leaving the other signal components unaltered. This approach lies at the basis of noise-reduction techniques known as Dolby techniques, and in particular the Dolby-B technique. These are techniques widely used for noise reduction, as is described, for example, in the publication &ldquo;Dolby Licensee Information Manual: Noise Reduction,&rdquo; issue 6, Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation (1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since the music industry continues to produce compact cassettes recorded in analog format, noise-reduction decoders of the same type as Dolby-B decoders implemented, for example, in the car-radio industry, have so far been built exclusively using analog-signal processing techniques (i.e., using circuits comprising resistors, capacitors and other analog electronic components). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Over the last few years, the car-radio industry has identified in digital signal processors (DSPs) the most convenient alternative to dedicated analog circuits. In fact, any currently available analog circuit designed specifically for a given purpose may be reproduced most effectively in the form of an algorithm which is run on a DSP purposely programmed for emulating the given circuit. In this way, most of the functions available in a car radio, in particular reduction of the tape noise, can be performed by a DSP, provided that an appropriate software capable of emulating the functions of the analog circuit is made available. This software can be updated, redesigned, reconfigured and modified according to software evolution, industry and market trends, in a way altogether independent of the processing device itself. Furthermore, since digital-signal processing device are constantly decreasing in cost and increasing in performance, it is possible also for the device to be updated, leaving the functions, configurations and performance of the software unaltered. In addition, digital-signal processing devices are largely insensitive to variations in manufacturing lots and variations due to temperature given that they basically carry out arithmetic operations instead of implementing transfer functions of an analog type. This fact constitutes a further advantage as regards implementation based on digital processors, since in noise-reduction systems the tolerances in regard to variations in component parameters must be very stringent in order to avoid any possible mismatches between encoder and decoder. Such mismatches may lead to perceptible differences between the original audio information and the audio information present in the decoded signal. A digital implementation of the decoder is thus free from any possible mismatches caused by tolerance faults in the decoder components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> What has been said so far is, however, true only up to a point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Techniques are in fact known which enable design of digital-signal processing systems which merely implement pre-existing analog-signal processing systems. There are moreover known techniques which enable implementation in digital form of analog feedback-controlled networks, where the non-linear components are intrinsically grouped together in one or more control sub-networks. In spite of this, certain noise-reduction systems of the Dolby-B type cannot be implemented simply by converting their blocks into the digital domain, or by grouping together their non-linear blocks into one or more sub-networks designed to control one or more linear blocks. Indeed, the currently accepted idea in the sector is that the operation of decoding encoded signals using noise-reduction systems of a known type, such as Dolby B, cannot be implemented satisfactorily in digital form. This fact is believed to be due to the decoding strategy adopted in systems of the Dolby-B type and similar systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the attached drawings are high-level representations of the structure used by Dolby B and similar systems to encode (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and decode (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) audio signals. In detail, the audio signal X<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be encoded passes through an encoding block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the output of which is added to the original signal by means of an adder <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> so as to produce the encoded signal Y<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. During playback, the signal Y<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (which is made up of the encoded signal Y<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the tape noise) is decoded to produce an audio signal X<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, in which the tape noise is reduced. The decoding process uses a decoding block <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> identical to the block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The signal <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is fed back to the block <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> so as to produce an encoded version of the reconstructed signal <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, which is to be subtracted from the signal <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to produce the decoded audio signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It can be shown that the decoder in fact reconstructs at output the original audio signal XE <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the signal <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&mdash;in the absence of tape noise. Intuitively, if the decoder produces a signal <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> identical to the signal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, then the latter signal can be used to calculate the signal <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Given the equality between the blocks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the signal <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be subtracted from the signal <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> so as to reconstruct the original audio signal. In practice, a noise-reduction system of the same type as the Dolby-B system comes close to satisfying the hypothesis of absence of tape noise, given that it cancels out the typical tape noise of a compact cassette, as this noise may be perceived during playback. Furthermore, this architecture presents a clear practical advantage in terms of implementation of the noise-reduction system by means of analog circuits, since both the encoder and the decoder use the same electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To illustrate the concept more clearly, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the blocks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> have been expanded and represented as conceptually divided into a filtering part and a control part. Both parts of the decoder are identical to homologous parts of the encoder. In the encoder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>the filtering part <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> generates two outputs, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The former of these outputs feeds the adder <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> to produce the encoded signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The latter output feeds the control part <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> so as to generate a signal <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which is used to drive the filtering part. Symmetrically, in the decoder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the two outputs, <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, of the filtering part <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are used, respectively, to produce the decoded signal <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (after subtraction from the signal <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>) and to drive the control part <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. As in the previous case, the output <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> of the control part drives the filtering part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the high-level structures of the encoder and decoder, respectively, are further expanded. Both the encoder and the decoder require a preliminary stage&mdash;blocks <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, respectively&mdash;for eliminating the undesired components of the signal, as well as the other high-frequency signals outside the band of the tape recorder. The filtering part is divided into a linear filter and a non-linear characteristic, the latter being also referred to as overshoot characteristic, the role of which will emerge more clearly from what follows. The signal <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>is produced by the linear filter <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. The signal <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the signal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>is produced by processing the signal <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> with the overshoot characteristic <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Symmetrically, in the decoder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the signal <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the signal <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>is produced by the linear filter <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight>. The signal <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the signal <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>is produced by processing the signal <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> with the overshoot characteristic <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> identical to the overshoot characteristic <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the subtraction <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is here performed by the inverter <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>. In this way, the side effect is obtained of inverting the sign of the decoded signal <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>, without this having any consequences for the audio signal reproduced during playback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The control part is likewise divided into a control filter and a rectifying stage, also known as non-linear integrator. In the encoder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the signal <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, which is identical to the signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, is processed by a linear control filter <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, the output <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of which feeds the non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. This block produces a slowly varying signal <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, which drives the linear filter contained in the filtering part of the encoder. Similarly, in the decoder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the signal <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, which is identical to the signal <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, is processed by a linear control filter <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>, which is identical to the linear control filter <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, and the output <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> of which feeds the non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, which in turn is identical to the non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. Also this block produces a slowly varying signal <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, which is identical to the signal <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and which drives the linear filter contained in the filtering part of the decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The network shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> represents the non-linear integrator. The voltage-controlled input signal <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is rectified by two non-linear resistances in parallel, each one of these being obtained by means of a resistor&mdash;R<highlight><subscript>415 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>420</subscript></highlight>&mdash;and a germanium diode&mdash;Ge<highlight><subscript>425 </subscript></highlight>and Ge<highlight><subscript>430</subscript></highlight>, respectively. The rectified signal is then processed by two integration stages: one is a linear resistor/capacitor stage in parallel made up of a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>435 </subscript></highlight>and a resistor R<highlight><subscript>440</subscript></highlight>; the other is a non-linear resistor/capacitor stage in series made up of a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>455 </subscript></highlight>and a non-linear resistance defined by a resistor R<highlight><subscript>450 </subscript></highlight>in parallel with a silicon diode Si<highlight><subscript>445</subscript></highlight>. The control signal <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, which is equal to the level of charge of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>455</subscript></highlight>, is the signal presented at output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The non-linear integrator illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is able to provide a control signal that meets the following requirements: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The rectification speed depends upon the variation in the dynamics of the input signal during the attack phase; i.e., the wider the increase in dynamics on the input, the faster the rectification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> There occurs a linear decay during a release phase; i.e., the control signal drops exponentially in the presence of a decrease in dynamics of the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> There are no discontinuities in the output signal; i.e., the signal <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> presents a smooth evolution even in the presence fast attacks due to large onsets in the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Even though the non-linear integrator reacts promptly to large onsets present on the input, it cannot drive the filtering part of the decoder in the presence of large but short onsets of the signal to be encoded. In this case, the non-linear characteristic <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> provides a transient overshoot compression which has the effect of limiting the high&mdash;and undesired&mdash;dynamics of the signal <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> during onsets that are large but short. Hence, the signal <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> encodes correctly the audio signal also in the presence of large but short onsets of the signal. The role of the overshoot compression <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> at the decoding stage is, as usual, reversed, so that the signal <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is correctly decoded even during large but short onsets of the signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to overcome the hitherto unresolved problem of converting the non-linear feedback loop of the noise-reduction systems of the Dolby-B decoder into a system with stable operation. A further object of the present invention is to reproduce closely the transfer functions and the behavior of non-linear dynamics of the analog decoder of a noise-reduction system, such as Dolby B, in the presence of different input signals, including signals presenting large but short onsets, in such a way that the audio signal recovered using the present invention is not discernibly different from the one that would have been obtained using a Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder of an analog type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention the above objects are achieved thanks to a process having the characteristics referred to specifically in the ensuing claims. The invention also relates, independently, to the corresponding device, as well as to the corresponding computer-program product, which can be loaded directly into the memory of a processing device, such as a DSP, and which comprises portions of software code, which, when the product is run on the said processing device, implement the process according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In particular, the solution according to the invention enables implementation of a noise-reduction system using signal-processing techniques of a digital type. More in particular, the solution according to the invention enables decoding of encoded audio signals using noise-reduction techniques, specifically Dolby-B techniques. The encoded signal is first processed by means of a digital filter of the sliding-band type. The signal thus processed is supplied both to a non-linear block and to a filtering stage of a linear type which contains an all-pole digital filter. The output of the non-linear block is added to the encoded signal and then processed by means of a further all-pole digital filter so as to produce the decoded signal. The output of the linear filtering chain drives a control stage which determines the parameters of the sliding-band digital filter and of the two all-pole digital filters. These parameters are determined in such a way as to emulate closely the performance of a noise-reduction decoder of an analog type, such as a Dolby-B decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Basically, the non-linear feedback chain of the analog decoder is converted into a non-linear digital filtering chain of the feedforward type so as to overcome the problems caused by the delay-free non-linear feedback loop introduced by a direct conversion of the analog decoder into the digital field, which would prevent stable operation of the digital decoder itself. The fact of using a feedforward solution instead of a feedback path entails a change in the transfer characteristics of the non-linear components present in the decoder.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As a premise to the illustration of an example of embodiment of the invention, it is useful to make a number of considerations of a general nature regarding the possibility of implementing in a digital form circuits according to the prior art of the type of the ones previously illustrated with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The starting point for the above considerations will be <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which in itself illustrates a scheme that is conceptually similar to the one represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the said considerations being made in conjunction with two additional basic considerations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> in the various implementations in digital form illustrated in what follows, it will be assumed that the signal sent to the input of the decoder has previously been converted (according to amply known criteria) into digital form; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> in the embodiments of a digital type, an input stage, such as the stage <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>may in fact be omitted, since the digitized signal at input is already free from those components the presence of which alters the activity of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As is well known, using familiar techniques it is possible to reproduce the transfer function performed by the analog structure represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the form of a structure purely of a feedforward type (see, for example, Sanjit K. Mitra, Digital Signal Processing. A computer-based Approach, (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In actual fact, the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in which the signal <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> is produced from the signal <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> using, as block <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>, a linear analog filter, can be reproduced in the form of the structure represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>where a linear filter (for reasons of simplicity we shall continue to refer to an implementation of an analog type) represented by the block <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> reproduces a signal <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> identical to the signal <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, whilst a linear filter represented by the block <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> produces a signal <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> identical to the signal <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be simplified into the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>where the block <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>, the signal <highlight><bold>539</bold></highlight> and the signal <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> are respectively identical to the block <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, the signal <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and the signal <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Finally, the (analog) linear filter represented by the block <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> can be replaced with a digital signal processor having a basically similar transfer characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> This said, it may be immediately realized that the simple transposition described previously becomes far more complex, and in certain cases even impossible, if the analog linear filter represented by the block <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is replaced by one or more elements with non-linear behavior. In the analog decoder of a Dolby-B noise-reduction system, the decoding stage corresponds to the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>where the block <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> must, however, be replaced (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) with the sliding-band filter <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> cascaded with the overshoot-suppression stage <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, the overshoot-suppression is active only when large but short onsets arise in the signal to be decoded, in so far as otherwise the decoding stage is substantially linear. For this reason, it may be stated that a modified version of the structure represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(and in particular the modified version represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>containing an overshoot-suppression stage <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> that is active only in the presence of large but short onsets of the input signal) closely approximates the transfer characteristics of the filtering part of a Dolby-B noise-reduction system, not only when the overshoot-suppression block is inactive, but also when the said block is activated by short but large onsets of the signal to be decoded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The resulting high-level structure is the one represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and is substantially the one adopted in the solution according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each sample <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> of the encoded signal is subtracted from a processed version <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight> of the same sample, which is obtained by passing it through a sliding-band digital filtering structure <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> cascaded with an overshoot-suppression stage <highlight><bold>666</bold></highlight>. The errors introduced by the fact that the block <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>has been converted into a digital block, such as the block <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>, are canceled using an all-pole digital filter <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight>, which processes the signal <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight> to supply the decoded signal <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight>. As in the case of the traditional Dolby-B decoder of an analog type, the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>envisages a non-linear path through which is passed to produce a new signal which is to be subtracted from the input signal. However, in the case of the invention this path is a path of a feedforward type, and consequently does not generate a non-linear, delay-free feedback loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The sample <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> produced by the sliding-band digital filtering structure is used to drive the control chain, after the errors introduced by the block <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> (which constitutes the digital transposition of the block <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) have been canceled by the all-pole digital filter <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight>, which is cascaded of the corresponding processing chain so as to produce the sample <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight>. The control block <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> comprises a high-pass filter, also referred to as digital control filter, which is designed to approximate the transfer characteristic of the control filter <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in series with a non-linear stage, referred to as digital non-linear integrator, which is designed to approximate closely the transfer characteristic of the non-linear integrator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The output <highlight><bold>684</bold></highlight> of the control stage is used to compute an index for looking up parameters in a lookup table. The parameters thus obtained, designated by <highlight><bold>688</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>690</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>692</bold></highlight>, are designed to drive&mdash;during processing of the next time sample&mdash;respectively the biquadratic digital filter contained in the sliding-band filtering structure <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight>, and two all-pole filters <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight>, the error-canceling characteristics of which must be modified according to the errors introduced by the sliding-band filter. The said tables are contained in the block <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight>. As in the case of the traditional Dolby-B decoder, the solution according to the invention uses the signal processed by the sliding-band filtering structure to drive the control chain. However, in the solution according to the present invention this signal is derived from a feedforward path, and is not instead generated within a non-linear feedback loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the annexed drawings basically replicates the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with a slightly modified formalism&mdash;above all as regards the naming of the blocks&mdash;in agreement with the terminology adopted in what follows. In particular, it will be noted that the blocks <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> of the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>respectively implement the stages <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>667</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight>, which have been previously described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As explained, the filtering part of a Dolby-B decoder of an analog type has a linear behavior with the only exception of the behavior in the presence of large but short onsets of the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The transfer characteristics of the filters <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are defined in such a way that the filtering part in the invention closely approximates the characteristics of an analog decoder in conditions of linear decoding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In particular, if H(s) denotes the transfer function of the analog filter <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>&mdash;Note also the block <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the transfer function of the analog filter <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> required for having equivalence between the signals <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and, likewise, between the signals <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>539</bold></highlight>, is given by the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>)&equals;<highlight><italic>H</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>)/(1<highlight><italic>&plus;H</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>))</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the digital filtering structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> is designed in such a way as to approximate closely an analog filter having the transfer function F(s). As a result of the transposition into digital form of the aforesaid transfer function, in the signals <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> there are inevitably errors which will be canceled in a very precise way by the filter <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> and the filter <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. The second-order all-pole structure and the coefficient values of the said filters are determined (for example empirically) in order to minimize the difference between the analog transfer functions H(s) and F(s), and the digital transfer characteristics of the block <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> designed to produce the signal <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> (and, indirectly, the signal <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Instead, the signal-processing structure used in the present invention differs from the structure of the traditional analog Dolby-B decoder in non-linear decoding conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The differences may basically be accounted for by the transfer characteristics of the non-linear components. In practice, the input/output characteristic of the overshoot-suppression block <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, the voltage-to-conductance characteristics of the diodes Ge<highlight><subscript>425</subscript></highlight>, Ge<highlight><subscript>430 </subscript></highlight>and Si<highlight><subscript>445 </subscript></highlight>present in the non-linear integrator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and finally the voltage-to-conductance characteristic of the field-effect transistor that drives the sliding-band characteristic of the analog filter <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> must be redefined in view of a transposition into the digital domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the overshoot-suppression stage <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> and the digital non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> of the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>envisage the use of transfer characteristics that differ from those of the homologous analog elements. In particular, the structure of the stage <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> and of the integrator <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> is defined in such a way as to emulate the homologous stages <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> (see again <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), with reference to a virtual replacement of the non-linear components of the latter with those defined in what follows. In particular, in the currently preferred embodiment of the invention, implementation&mdash;in digital form&mdash;is envisaged for all the signal-processing functions represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This may be done, for example, using a DSP, such as the double-processing-unit device available from and produced by the present applicant with the coding TDA 7500. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The Dolby level in this system is set at the value of 0.0625, corresponding to approximately &minus;24 dB Full Scale. The internal state of the digital non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>, which in fact corresponds to the charge of the two capacitors C<highlight><subscript>435 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>455</subscript></highlight>, respectively measured at the points <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, is initially set at zero. This implies that the output sample from the digital non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>, namely y<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>, which corresponds to the charge <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, is also set at zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Then, the processing steps described below are performed on each output sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The value y<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>is used to look up, in the look-up table already described previously, corresponding output values V&lsqb;0&rsqb;, . . . , V&lsqb;k&rsqb; on the basis of the characteristic represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, where the extracted values correspond to the voltage values labeled with &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo;. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, k is chosen equal to 51, which means that the characteristic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is articulated on 52. The said characteristic (which is essentially a conductance characteristic&mdash;ordinate axis&mdash;as a function of the normalized voltage&mdash;abscissa axis) can be viewed as being obtained by a sort of contraction of the abscissa axis (voltage) of the homologous characteristic of a field-effect transistor, such as the FET CAT66, in such a way that the maximum value assumed by y<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>with the aforesaid Dolby level is 0.12. Otherwise, y<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>is clipped to the said value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Next, the quantity V(n) is determined as the closest value smaller than or equal to y<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>; n is extracted, and the quantity r is determined by computing the interpolation factor</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>r&equals;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>y</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&mdash;V</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>))/(<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n&plus;</italic></highlight>1)&minus;<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>))</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Next, n is used to look up, in the corresponding look-up table, the parameters K<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>(n) , a<highlight><subscript>1s</subscript></highlight>(n) , a<highlight><subscript>2s</subscript></highlight>(n) , b<highlight><subscript>1s</subscript></highlight>(n) b<highlight><subscript>2s</subscript></highlight>(n) of the biquadratic filter contained in the digital sliding-band filter <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, as well as the parameters K<highlight><subscript>sc</subscript></highlight>(n), a<highlight><subscript>1sc</subscript></highlight>(n), a<highlight><subscript>2sc</subscript></highlight>(n) of the all-pole filter <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, and the parameters K<highlight><subscript>cc</subscript></highlight>(n), a<highlight><subscript>1cc</subscript></highlight>(n), a<highlight><subscript>2cc</subscript></highlight>(n) of the all-pole filter <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. The meaning of the parameters referred to above is well known to the person skilled in the branch and does not require any detailed explanation herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, each coefficient (namely c) of the above filters is determined from the parameters looked up, by means of the following relation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>c&equals;c</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>)&plus;<highlight><italic>r</italic></highlight>* (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n&plus;</italic></highlight>1)&minus;<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>))</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> This technique is basically a form of linear interpolation between coefficients, given the index n and the interpolation factor r. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> At this point, the values of the coefficients of the biquadratic filter contained in the sliding-band filtering structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, as well as the coefficients of the two all-pole filters <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> are determined unambiguously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In particular, the determination may be made, as a function of the factors n and r, on the basis of the characteristics given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the transfer function</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>H</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight>)&equals;0.70067297&plus;<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>(1&plus;<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1s</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;b</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2s</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>)/(1<highlight><italic>&plus;a</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1s</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>31 1</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;a</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2s</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> of the sliding-band digital filtering structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> is applied to the input sample <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, so as to compute the sample <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The overshoot-suppression characteristic <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> corresponding to the input-output characteristic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is then applied to the sample <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. In this way, the sample <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> is calculated, which is subtracted from the input <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> by means of the adder <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, so as to calculate the sample <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The transfer function of the all-pole digital filter <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> is applied to the sample <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, so as to compute the output sample <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The characteristic of the all-pole digital filter <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> is then applied to the sample <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> to compute the sample <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. To the latter sample is applied the transfer function of the digital control filter <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight>:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>H</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight>)&equals;(0.55650835&minus;0.4579547<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>)/(1&minus;0.01446301<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> in order to calculate the sample <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The sample <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> is then amplified (for example by a factor of 16) to produce the input sample x<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>for non-linear rectification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Then the voltage difference corresponding to that of the silicon diode Si<highlight><subscript>445 </subscript></highlight>of the non-linear integrator is determined. In particular, denoting by s<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>the charge level of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>435</subscript></highlight>, measured at point <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> (with reference to the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) the said voltage is equal to s<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>&minus;y<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The conductance G<highlight><subscript>si </subscript></highlight>of the diode Si<highlight><subscript>445 </subscript></highlight>is then emulated in digital form. This is done by means of a look-up table corresponding to the characteristic illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, and hence choosing the closest voltage level smaller than or equal to the difference s<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>-y<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>; otherwise, the maximum voltage value contained in the look-up table is chosen. The voltage value chosen identifies the conductance value determined. It will be appreciated that the characteristic in question may be viewed as being obtained by contracting by a factor of approximately 800 the axis of the abscissa (voltage) of the voltage characteristic (conductance) of a reference CAT66 silicon diode. The aforesaid factor is determined empirically, in such a way that the dynamics of the output signal in the present invention will not be appreciably different from the dynamics of the signal decoded by a Dolby-B decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If x<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>&gE;0, then the voltage difference is determined across the germanium diode Ge<highlight><subscript>425 </subscript></highlight>in parallel with the resistor r<highlight><subscript>415</subscript></highlight>. If x<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>&lt;0, then the voltage difference is instead determined across the germanium diode Ge<highlight><subscript>450 </subscript></highlight>in parallel with the resistor R<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Since the two germanium diodes in question are identical, as likewise are the resistors in parallel thereto, the said function can be calculated in digital form by computing the absolute value of x<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>, and then computing the difference between said absolute value and s<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>, the latter voltage applying in any case to both of the two branches considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, the conductance of the one of the two branches that is actually conducting, depending on the sign of x<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>, is determined. Once again, this is done resorting to a look-up table corresponding to the characteristic represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and choosing the closest voltage value smaller than or equal to the aforesaid difference; otherwise, the maximum voltage value contained in the look-up table is chosen. The conductance value looked up is then determined as the conductance associated to the chosen voltage. The characteristic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is obtained by shrinking by a factor of 60 the voltage axis (abscissa) of the voltage/conductance characteristic of a reference CAT66 germanium diode in series with a 5600-ohm resistor. The said factor is determined empirically in such a way that the dynamics of the output signal will not be appreciably different from the dynamics of the signal decoded by a Dolby-B decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, the values sn<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>and yn<highlight><subscript>NLI </subscript></highlight>are calculated by solving, according to known criteria, Kirchhoff&apos;s equations for the electrical network corresponding to the non-linear integrator of the Dolby-B decoder. In particular, this is done, not only according to the parameters already seen previously, but also according to the parameters corresponding to the conductances of the components R<highlight><subscript>440 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>450 </subscript></highlight>of the scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Specifically, the coefficients are determined by the structure of the space of the states of the digital non-linear integrator present in the scheme according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The corresponding criteria are well known to the art, as evidenced, for instance, by the work of Sanjit K. Mitra cited previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the aforesaid equations in the digital domain for a given sampling frequency, namely F<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>, the following voltage/current relation has been specifically adopted:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>vn&equals;v&plus;i/F</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>C.</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In practice, this corresponds to calculating the charge Vn for the next sample in relation to a capacitance C charged with the voltage v and traversed by a current i. In particular, v&equals;R*i makes it possible to calculate the voltage on a resistor R traversed by a current i during a time interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The new output sample of the digital non-linear integrator <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> is yn<highlight><subscript>NLI</subscript></highlight>. The procedure so far described is then repeated to compute a new output sample <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight>, given the new input sample <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As is in any case evident for a person skilled in the sector, without prejudice to the general basic approach adopted for implementing the solution according to the invention, the choice of the specific design criteria referred to previously, in particular as regards the choice of the characteristics represented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is presented purely by way of example in order to illustrate the embodiment of the invention that is currently preferred. The specific choice of one characteristic or another, or of particular details of implementation, must not therefore be interpreted as in any way limiting the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The proposed embodiment of the invention provides optimal decoding of the encoded signal when the input appears in the sampled form of the analog signal at a frequency of 48 507 samples per second, or 48 507 kHz. Indeed, it has been verified that the invention closely emulates the behavior of an analog Dolby-B decoder even if the sampling frequency presents a 10% deviation from its optimal value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> This makes it possible to use the solution according to the invention both in the case of FM radio broadcasting according to the European and American standard, using a 48 507-kHz sampling frequency, and in the case of FM radio broadcasting according to the Japanese standard, which envisages a sampling frequency of 44 132 kHz. In particular, the device according to the invention is suited for implementation in a DSP, which, with reference to the possible applications recalled previously, enables clock frequencies in the region of 43.46 MHz and 45.19 MHz to be used. In this way, it is possible to prevent there being any residual frequency components deriving from the DSP clock in the FM radio frequency range from 87.5 MHz to 108 MHz for Europe and America, and from 76 MHz to 90 MHz for Japan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the analog Dolby-B decoder, the Dolby level is established in the phase of design of the integrated circuit, whereas in the invention presented herein it can be defined through the variation of a software parameter. The choice of the Dolby level is limited by two factors: an upper bound, determined by specific headroom requirements (&minus;15 dB Full Scale) and a lower bound which can be put down to the unavoidable ground noise of the analog-to-digital converter (&minus;93 dB Full Scale). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The performance of the invention is not affected by variations in manufacturing lots or variations in temperature as in the case of implementations based upon analog integrated circuits or discrete components, where each component is affected by drift due to age and temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows various frequency responses, each one obtained by applying as input signal to application based upon the invention a sinusoid of a given amplitude (from 0 dB Dolby level to &minus;45 dB Dolby level, through 5-dB steps). Each sinusoid slowly sweeps along the 20 Hz-20 kHz range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows three attack time responses using a 1-kHz sinusoid enveloped to &minus;17 dB Dolby level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The measurements were carried out in the following conditions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Dolby-B noise-reduction reference encoder enabled, and Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder implemented as DSP disabled (dark gray); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Dolby-B noise-reduction reference encoder enabled, and Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder implemented as DSP enabled (black); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Dolby-B noise-reduction reference encoder disabled, and Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder implemented as DSP disabled (light gray). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows three recovery-time responses of the system using a 2-kHz sinusoid enveloped to &minus;15 dB Dolby level after 100 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The measurements were carried out in the following conditions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Dolby-B noise-reduction reference encoder enabled, and Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder implemented as DSP disabled (dark gray); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Dolby-B noise-reduction reference encoder enabled, and Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder implemented as DSP enabled (black); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Dolby-B noise-reduction reference encoder disabled, and Dolby-B noise-reduction decoder implemented as DSP disabled (light gray). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In both cases (attack and recovery), the overall response of the system based upon the present invention meets the Dolby-B noise-reduction requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Of course, without prejudice to the principle of the invention, the details of construction and the embodiments may vary widely with respect to what is described and illustrated herein, without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention as defined in the ensuing claims. In particular, it will be appreciated that, even though the foregoing description specifically refers to audio signals subjected to Dolby-B noise-reduction encoding, the scope of the invention extends also to similar types of encoding; consequently, the scope of the present invention is not to be in any way understood as being limited to the sole Dolby-B type encoding. </paragraph>
