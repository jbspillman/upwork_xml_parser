<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An article and method for reinforcing structural members is provided. The article includes a carbon fiber material, preferably a carbon fiber mesh with a roughened surface defined by an epoxy resin. The article has lateral fibers woven into longitudinal carbon fibers that are in tension, creating a mesh. An epoxy resin is applied to the fiber mesh to form a rigidified fiber mesh tape once the resin is cured. To obtain a roughened surface a plastic sheet is removably attached to the surface of the fiber mesh. The plastic sheet is removed thereby exposing a roughened carbon fiber surface defined by the epoxy. An alternative tensile tape is also provided for reinforcing a wall structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a product for use in reinforcing structures and a method for attaching the product to the structure and in particular to reinforce concrete walls using carbon fiber material with epoxy adhered to the carbon fiber material. The invention further includes a rigidified mesh of carbon fiber material designed for adherence to a structural element. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Walls constructed of concrete blocks are well known in the field of construction and have been extensively used for both above ground and basement walls. Such concrete walls constructed in this manner are generally capable of supporting residential and light commercial structures and are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and repair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to construct a concrete wall, individual blocks are laid end to end and successive rows or courses are stacked thereon. Mortar between each adjacent block and row secures the wall together. These walls are such that they have excellent compressive strength to support structures placed upon them. However, these walls are inherently weak with respect to lateral loads and are particularly susceptible to cracking from water pressure. This inherent weakness of concrete walls is attributable to the structural characteristics of the concrete walls themselves and the mortar joints at which they are connected. Walls constructed in this manner are relatively strong in compression and are thus well suited for supporting overlying structures. However, both the concrete material and particularly the mortar joints are weak in tension, and when subjected to a tensile force, they tend to separate relatively easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Water penetrating deeply into the soil adjacent a basement wall causes substantial lateral movement of the expanding soil against the wall. Over a period of time, block or concrete walls develop diagonal cracks at the ends and vertical cracks near their centers. Such cracks can admit water under pressure from the surrounding soil and, if left untreated, can progressively widen and eventually facilitate collapse of the entire structure with resultant damage to the structure supported on it. In addition to developing such cracks, concrete walls typically either bow inwardly and such bowing or tilting steadily worsens with the weight of the overlying structure. The water pressure exerts a compressive force at the outer end, therefore, basement wall cracks tend to develop on the inside of such walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One of the traditional methods of repairing the leaks and cracks and relieving the external pressure is to drill holes and provide for channeling of the water away on the inside. Yet another method for repairing cracks and leaks is to inject an epoxy resin into the cracks. Although these methods will prevent further water from entering the cracks they do not bind the concrete walls and prevent further cracking or bowing of the concrete walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Yet another means of correcting the cracks in the walls is to use fiberglass cloth with epoxy or polyester resin. Fiberglass has good tensile properties and can carry the load on the interior of the basement walls that is in tension. However, one of the major drawbacks with this method is that mixing the epoxy or polyester and wetting out the fabric is time consuming and messy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The use of carbon fiber bonded plates for structural application has been an area of study for many years. The cost of the carbon fiber material has not allowed practical applications to keep up with academic evaluations. Carbon fiber plates have been studied as an external reinforcement by the Swiss Federal Testing Laboratories and is documented in a paper written in 1995. &lsqb;Meier, U,; Winsitorfer, A. <highlight><italic>Retro</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>fitting of Structures through external Bonding of CFRP Sheets. </italic></highlight>Non-Metallic Reinforcement of Concrete Structures, Ghent, (1995), pages 465-472&rsqb; In this case it was &ldquo;used to repair a defective structure, to allow for increases in applied load, or to allow modification for changes in use.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another experiment was carried out in the use of carbon fiber strips to reinforce masonry structures to resist earthquakes. &lsqb;STEINER, W. <highlight><italic>Strengthening of structures with CFRP strips. </italic></highlight>Advanced Composite Materials and Structures, Montreal, 1996, pp407-417. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The use of carbon fiber plates for reinforcement and repair of concrete structures is well documented and known by those skilled in the art. In recent years, this technology, which has been well documented in the literature, has, with lowered cost of carbon material, become economically feasible to apply this technology to concrete walls which are reinforced using precut strips of carbon fiber. This prevents the walls from cracking or collapsing. However, precut carbon fiber strips have to be cleaned and roughened, commonly done through sanding, to provide mechanical adhesion with the walls. The sanding process is not only time consuming, but is completely dependent on the skill of the operator sanding the surface of the strip. Sanding also may not remove oil or waxy materials and may spread such contaminants with a detrimental affect on bonding. This results in extra cost in transporting and storing the precut strips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The strips of carbon for these prior systems must also be narrow to insure that air pockets are not trapped under the carbon fiber strips. Inspection for air pockets is costly and difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The strips being of high fiber density provides a very stiff strip which greatly differs in stiffness from the masonry that it is reinforcing this causes an &ldquo;edge effect&rdquo; stress between the reinforced and un-reinforced masonry. The stiffness variation at the edge of the strip has been shown to cause cracking at the junction for the reinforced to un-reinforced masonry due to shear at this large change in relative stiffness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, the thickness of normal pultrusion or carbon plates provides a structure which is much too stiff for the bonding characteristics of the adhesive or the surface strength of the masonry structure. That is, the reinforcement is of no use if it pulls loose from the surface to which it is bonded. This loosening can be due to the reinforcement being too strong and pulling loose due to unequal thermal expansion, this condition is aggravated by the reinforcement being too stiff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The carbon strips, which are very stiff, can come loose from the structure that it is reinforcing. Generally the bonding material and the surface of the structure being reinforced is much weaker and has a significantly lower modulus of elasticity than that of the carbon fiber. This sudden loosening starts with a high stress causing a crack at an air void or other high stress area; this initial crack can propagate due to a high stress at the crack and lack of elongation in the carbon fiber material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The use of a plate also blocks moisture flow through the masonry structure thus capturing moisture behind the plate. This moisture rich area tends to weaken the masonry and masonry to adhesive bond area. In areas of frost this moisture allows frost action to work on the bond with deleterious freezing and expansion of the moisture; this action can cause delamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With the limitations of the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide an article for reinforcing a structure element to effectively resist bending or other lateral forces applied to the structure element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an article that does not require any sanding to provide mechanical adhesion in order to attach the article to the structural element and one which will remain sufficiently clean at a job site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an article that prevents air pockets from forming, that inhibits micro-crack propagation, and prevents thick glue areas from developing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method whereby an article for use in reinforcing is firmly adhered to the structural element, thereby reinforcing the structural member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to use existing materials to apply uniform pressure to firmly adhere the article to the structural element, thereby resulting in a strong reinforced structural member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a product and method which is economical, efficient in operation, and capable of a long operating life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for adhering a breathable strip and adhesive to allow moisture migration through the bonded reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for applying a reinforcement structure that is wider than a strip to minimize the &ldquo;edge effect&rdquo; stresses at the boundary between the reinforced and un-reinforced structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is also an object to provide reinforcement through spacing and choice of fiber type to provide a better match between the reinforcement and the structure. This provides a strip which does not overpower the bonding material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another object is to taper the edges of the sheet to reduce stress concentrations along the edges of the strip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide a reinforcement that, if it fails, will fail in a progressive manner thus providing a visual warning that failure is occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide a method of applying reinforcements to the wall which hold the reinforcement in place until the bonding is completed for a neat, strong and workmanlike reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide a method of manufacturing a grid where the lateral fibers are woven or wrapped to the longitudinal fibers thus tying the fibers together to allow the stiff longitudinal fibers to carry the load and the elastic lateral fibers to deform to spread the loading more evenly across the glue and supported structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, an article (a reinforcing member) and method for reinforcing structural elements, such as concrete walls, support beams and the like, are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The article in accordance with the present invention comprises a carbon fiber strip with an exposed roughened surface. In order to make the article, epoxy resin is applied to carbon fibers. The epoxy resin is allowed to permeate the thickness of the carbon fibers. Due to the uneven surface of the carbon fibers, a thin layer of epoxy forms on a top or exterior of the carbon fiber. A plastic cover sheet is then placed on top of the carbon fiber. Carbon fiber material with the epoxy and the plastic fiber is then subjected to high heat and pressure to cure the epoxy thereby forming the carbon fiber into a rigid sheet, with an adhered cover sheet, that can be cut into strips. At the job site, the cover sheet is readily removed and the resultant sheet of carbon fiber will have a roughened surface defined by the epoxy resin where it had adhered to the cover sheet. The cover sheet keeps out greases and oils that sanding may not remove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the article comprises a rigidified carbon fiber mesh tape. The mesh tape is comprised of a number of carbon fibers woven together to form a rigidified matrix. When bonded to a structural element, the bonding agent flows through the mesh, eliminating air pockets and thick glue areas. Moreover, propagation of micro-cracks formed between fibers is limited to the spaces between fibers and cannot propagate along the mesh tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The mesh tape when used with a breathable adhesive will not trap moisture behind the reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The mesh tape since air entrapment is not an issue allows a wide sheet to be used. The wider sheet minimizes the structural changes between the reinforced and un-reinforced transition in the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The edges of the mesh tape can have wider fiber spacing to feather the stiffness of the tape so not to cause a large stress concentration at the junction of the reinforced structure to the un-reinforced structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The method of adhering the article to a structural element comprises the steps of applying a second epoxy resin to the structural element; adhering the article to the second epoxy resin; allowing the second resin to cure while applying pressure to the article and structural element. Pressure may be applied through use of an overlying plastic sheet, the edges of which are sealed with the help of an adhesive to the structural element. A uniform pressure is applied with the help of an external vacuum pump and the vacuum is applied until the epoxy is cured and the article is firmly fixed to the structural element.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> To obtain the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a layer of carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is provided. The first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> define a thickness <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fibers (not shown specifically in the drawings) of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are generally axially oriented with respect to the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for good tensile strength as is well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a first epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is applied to either the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment as illustrated in the drawings, the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is applied to the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Since the fibers in the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> defines gaps or voids between them, the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> permeates the entire thickness <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a thin layer or at least some of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains on the surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the epoxy resin has low viscosity such that when applied to the carbon fiber material it permeates the fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An alternate embodiment of the invention, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, is a rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, for use in reinforcing structure element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a number of longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a number of lateral or transverse fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> run parallel to one another and are in tension. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are woven into the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> alternating from a position above the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a position below the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> sandwich the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In other words, the carbon fibers are layered on top and below the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, providing a fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with straight longitudinal fibers. The straight fibers are thus ideally orientated to carry tension loading. The lateral fibers may ideally be made of another fiber that is very elastic and can be woven into the stiffer longitudinal fibers. A Kevlar&reg; type lateral fiber is ideal since it has very high elongation this elongation spreads the loading more evenly across the glue and the reinforced structure. Also a partial or local failure will not propagate, as with a plate, since the longitudinal fibers will stretch and reallocate the load by allowing adjacent longitudinal fibers to share the loading. This prevents a rapid crack propagation found in solid plates with a catastrophic or sudden failure. The longitudinal fiber should be kept straight since a woven fiber will tend to straighten when loaded which will put stress on the bonding agent and will tend to not be as stiff. A reduction of manufacturing cost and a reduction in lateral stiffness may be achieved by having lateral fibers only on one side. Note the lateral fibers can be woven to the longitudinal fibers using a fiber wrapping pattern to provide better attachment between the lateral and longitudinal fibers. Also this fiber can be chosen for adhesion with the chosen agent for bonding to the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be of any cross-sectional shape, such as flat (ribbon like), rectangular, oval or round. In the preferred embodiment, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> have a flat cross-section, as seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, providing a large surface area to contact the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and providing a low bending stiffness in the plane of the reinforcement strip. Alternatively, an elliptical cross-section (not particularly shown) may be used for the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to provide similar benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are generally at 90-degree angles (transverse) to the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be at 45-degree angles to the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or some angle between 45-degrees and 90-degrees. In a 45-degree fiber orientation, the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> tend to be loaded in tension along with the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be spaced anywhere from over 1 inch apart to less than {fraction (1/32)} inches apart so long as the spacing is sufficient to allow adhesive to flow between the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, as will be discussed in detail herein. The longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can vary in spacing to provide a tapered (or feathered) stiffness at the edge of the strip; this tapered stiffness provides a gradual change in stress between the reinforced and un-reinforced structure thus minimizing stress concentrations in the reinforced structure at the edge of the reinforcement strip. Alternatively, longitudinal fibers having tapered thicknesses along the edge of the strip or a different modulus can be used to feather the stiffness of the strip at the edges in order to minimize or reduce the stress concentrations at the edge of the reinforcement strip. The rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a roughened surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> exposed or produced upon removal of a cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as will be discussed in detail herein. In the preferred embodiment, the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are made of pre-cured carbon rods. The pre-cured carbon rods are positioned in a planar configuration and woven together with fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a fiber filament can be wound around the fiber strands <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to keep the tows from spreading out and closing the windows. In a preferred embodiment, filaments are wound helically along a length of the longitudinal fibers. Moreover, longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be of different materials to provide desired properties of rigidified mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, either fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be formed from a fibrous material having high axial bending to allow conformance to non-planar surfaces such as columns, tubes, or other curved surfaces. Additionally, the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a material having desirable chemical or mechanical properties to optimize adhesion to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the alternate embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (discussed above) is applied to the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a thin layer or at least some of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains on the surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the openings between the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> remain unobstructed. Use of a tear sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> rips away any epoxy film that may tend to close the windows thus assuring not only a clean surface, but also open windows. The grid pattern of the fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a high bonding surface area and provides a peel stop (rip stop) type function that a continuous surface does not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, to provide a strong bond between the reinforcing strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the reinforced structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is important to have the surface of the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> clean and roughed. In order to keep the surface clean and provide a roughened surface, over the layer of epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, on the surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (and optionally on the surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>), is applied a flexible cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of impermeable textile, nylon, or plastic material. The side of the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in contact with the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably exhibits a texture, such as a woven texture surface. The carbon fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, with the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> applied, are subject to high temperature and pressure, via known techniques, allowing the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to cure. Once the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has cured, the result is a rigid carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a removable cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> covering one or both surfaces thereof. This rigid carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may then be cut or sawn into the desired sizes forming the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this form, the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be stored and/or shipped to a job site for use. With the rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the resin applied during the manufacture of the open fabric tends to fill the window between the mesh. When the textured cover sheet is removed, these windows remain adhered to the cover sheet and leave the openings clear. Thus, the cover sheet provides both a roughened surface, but also open windows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> At the job site and during shipping and handling, the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> prevents dirt, hand oil, grease, and other debris, oils, and chemical from coming into contact with the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also protects the bonding surface from mechanical abrasion or polishing. Immediately prior to use, the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is removed, or more accurately peeled away, from the surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> leaving exposed a clean roughened surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This process saves time in the field as compared to prior methods which require solvent cleaning and abrasion steps. This roughened surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a result of at least two factors, individually or in combination. First, the roughened surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> causes an impression to be formed in the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as it cures. Second, as the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is removed from the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, some of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains adhered to the plastic sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and breaks away from the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in the drawings, the strips <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are pre-cut and provided in suitable lengths for their intended use. However, it is possible to use large sheets and/or cut them to the required sizes before adhering them to reinforce a structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the strips <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are intended to be attached to a structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as a concrete block wall, the face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of which is being loaded in tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In order to attach the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to reinforce the same, a second epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is applied to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be of the same kind or different kind from the first epoxy resin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such as a water permeable adhesive to allow the structure to breathe. An example of a water permeable adhesive is a urethane-type adhesive. The carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, with the plastic sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> removed and the roughened surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> exposed, is placed against the front face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the structural member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where the second epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has been applied, such that the roughened surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is contacting the second epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> firmly adheres to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> should be held in place until the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> cures. This is achieved in the method of the present invention by covering the sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with a sheet of air impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, such as a plastic sheet, and by positioning between the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> a material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which will allow for uniform evacuation of air from between the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is a commercially available bubble wrap, such as that extensively used in the packaging industry. Alternatively, a permeable textile, fabric or other material which will facilitate even evacuation over the sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, may also be used. In the preferred embodiment, any commercially available plastic sheet may be used as the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The edges of the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are then sealed to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through adhesives or adhesive strips <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so mounted to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> over the carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, air is evacuated through use of a vacuum pump <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> coupled via a vacuum line and fitted to the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Due to the presence of the material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, when a vacuum is applied, a uniform pressure is applied over the entire sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The vacuum is applied until the second epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> cures and the sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> firmly adheres to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Under this method, the normal curing time with common epoxies is expected to be about 3-4 hours, after which impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are removed. The carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or rigidified fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will thereafter be firmly attached to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> providing the desired reinforcement thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the rigidified fiber mesh tape embodiment of the invention, the second epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will flow through the spaces between the longitudinal fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the lateral fibers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> such that no thick glue areas are formed. Moreover, as pressure is applied, air will flow through the mesh holes between the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> preventing air pocket formation. When a plate is utilized according to other methods and is glued to the structural element, the plate and glue can trap air between the carbon fiber plate and the structural element. Air voids are stress risers and a source of micro-cracks. These micro-cracks, once started, may follow the plate surface and can lead to delamination of the plate. Similarly, thick glue areas may form between the carbon fiber plate and the structural element. Since the glue itself fails at a lower force than does the carbon fiber plate or the structural element, these thick glue areas create weak points in the reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> An alternate method of applying the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or fiber mesh tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided wherein the cover sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is removed from the strip to expose the roughened surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on a side of the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A generous layer of epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is applied along either the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or both. The strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed against the front face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while spreading epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> around the periphery of the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and onto the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> To ensure that the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or tape <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> firmly adheres to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is desirably held in place until the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fully cured. This is accomplished by placing an impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, such as a plastic sheet over the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a portion of the front face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is held in place over the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> around the periphery of the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to the mechanical adhesion of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Once the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is positioned generally over the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is manually dispersed to provide proper distribution and bonding to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In a preferred method, a deformable member such as a squeegee is manually traced over the surface of the impermeable material to disperse the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is dispersed, epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is spread past the periphery of the strip and contacts the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The mechanical adhesion of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> couples the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is curing. Also, the mechanical adhesion of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> holds the strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the structural element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during curing. By this method, no additional support is needed to hold the impermeable material <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in place while the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is curing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Another alternate embodiment of the invention, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is a carbon tensile tape for use in reinforcing structure element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as a concrete block wall, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a carbon fiber sheet <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> having a roughened surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> exposed or produced upon removal of a cover sheet <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The cover sheet <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> keeps the bonding area clean from dirt, hand oil, and other oils and debris during shipment and handling. The cover sheet <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> causes fracture and roughness of the coating material to assure consistent bonding. The cover sheet <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> protects the bonding surface from mechanical abrasion or polishing and saves time in the field for preparing a clean roughened surface on the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the present invention. To obtain the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a layer of carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> having a first surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, is formed. The carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> have a relatively high tensile strength, and are relatively bendable in the axial direction. The carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are oriented to form a first surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that define a thickness <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thickness of the tape or mesh may be in the order of 0.002 inches to 0.050 inches. The thickness <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed to allow relatively easy bending of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to conform to various irregularities as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. The flexibility of the tensile tape allows wider strips to be used (currently, about two-inch widths are the maximum that can be used with assurance that voids are not present). The fibers (not shown specifically in the drawings) are generally axially oriented with respect to the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for good tensile strength as is well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to the structure of tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a first epoxy resin <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is applied to either the first surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or the second surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment as illustrated in the drawings, the epoxy resin is applied to the first surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Since the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> when stacked into the desired shape of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> inherently includes gaps or voids between them, the epoxy resin permeates the entire thickness <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and a thin layer or at least some of the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> remains on the surface of the carbon fiber <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> has low viscosity such that when applied to the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> it permeates the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The first epoxy resin <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is applied to either surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or second surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment as illustrated in the drawings, the epoxy resin is applied to the first surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Since the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> when stacked in the desired shape of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> inherently includes areas between the fibers that are resin rich. This resin rich window will stick to the peel ply and be torn out of the tape when the peel ply is removed leaving an open window. The portion of the resin that permeates the longitudinal and lateral fibers remains after the peel ply is torn off. The epoxy resin <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> has a low viscosity such that when applied to the carbon and/or other fiber material the glue fully permeates the fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The axial flexibility of the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the relatively small thickness <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> allow conformance to surfaces having various shapes or contours. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, structural elements such as brick or cement may be formed to have external surfaces that are different that the common planar surface found on most structural elements. Also, the fibers running in the lateral direction can be of a lower stiffness due to shape and size and made of lower modulus material with higher elongation material such as Kevlar thus allowing the tape to easily bend laterally. The structural element <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a convex surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of a brick foundation wall. The convex surface, like the planar surface is subject to external forces that may cause damage to the structure element. Particularly, external forces that increase the tension load on the structure element may cause cracking of the brick or the mortar joints and cause bowing of the structure load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The carbon tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> in conjunction with the convex surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of structural element. <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> The tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned to allow the width of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to extend along the convex surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The tape acts as a membrane with relatively low plate bending stiffness that allows the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to conform to the convex surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> while retaining the axial orientation of the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to increase the tensile strength of the structural element <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is applied to the convex surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> using the method described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Another structural element <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> having an irregular surface is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The structural element <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is formed of a plurality of layered blocks or bricks supported by mortar. The structural element <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> also include various irregularities such as a protruding block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, a recessed block <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and a gap <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> between blocks. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having a relatively low bending stiffness conforms to each of these irregularities while increasing the tensional strength of the structural element <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In the case of a protruding block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape are bent around the edges <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the protruding block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and positioned adjacent to the outer surface <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of the protruded block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. In the case of a recessed block <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are bent around the edges <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the adjacent blocks <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and positioned adjacent to the outer surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the recessed block <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In the case of the gap <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> between blocks, the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> spans the gap <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and adheres to the blocks <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> adjacent to the gap and provide increased tensional strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a tensile tape <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, described above. As such, only the portions of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that are different will be discussed in detail. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is comprised of alternating sections of carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and translucent fiberglass fibers <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> formed into a strip <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> having a first side <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and a second side <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> defining a thickness <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The carbon fiber sections <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and fiberglass sections <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> are formed in a zebra like pattern. The translucent fiberglass fibers <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> allow visual inspection of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> during adhesion to a surface of the structural element. In particular the translucent fiberglass sections <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> allow the installer of the tensile tape to visually ensure the epoxy between the tensile tape <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and the structural element is properly positioned. Air pockets or improper distribution of the epoxy may reduce the effectiveness of the bond between the tensile tape and the structural element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, described above. As such, only the portions of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that are different will be discussed in detail. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> formed to allow visual inspection of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> during installation. The apertures also allow any air entrapped beneath the tape to escape which allows use of a wider strip. This minimizes the potential and the size of any air bubbles between the tape and the reinforced structure. In particular the apertures <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> allow the installer of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to visually ensure the epoxy between the tensile tape and the structural element is properly positioned. The apertures <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> also provide additional mechanical adhesion of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the structural element. The apertures <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape are formed by using an insert in a molding operation or other suitable means <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> while the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are being formed to the shape of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The inserts of the molding operation ensure that the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> remain continuous, thus increasing the tensile strength of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to the tensile tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, described above. As such, only the portions of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that are different will be discussed in detail. The tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> formed therein for allowing visual inspection during installation. The apertures <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> allow the installer of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to visually ensure the epoxy between the tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the structural element is properly positioned. The apertures <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are formed after the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the tensile tape <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are formed into the desired shape. The apertures <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are formed by a simple material removal process such as a punch or a machining process. </paragraph>
