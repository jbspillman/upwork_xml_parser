In addition the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> allows selected ones of the infra red lamps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and infra red lamps <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to direct infra red radiation over large regions of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which were at a temperature below the desired temperature. These large regions are those regions in which the temperature energy deficit multiplied by the area is the largest. The processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> allows the laser guns <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to direct the laser beams at small regions of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which have a relatively high temperature gradient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> also controls the valves <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such that there is pressure difference between the chambers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to superplastically form the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the shape of the die <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

During conventional superplastic forming the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is superplastically formed with a constant temperature across the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is clear that the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and thus the resulting component, or article, is thicker at its periphery with a gradual reduction in thickness to a minimum thickness at the centre of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the thickness distribution of an axis-symmetric workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during superplastic forming according to the present invention. During superplastic forming according to the present invention the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is superplastically formed with a temperature gradient applied across the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is clear that in this example the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and thus the resulting component, or article, has a more uniform thickness and reduced thinning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As an example of the present invention the superplastic forming of an axis-symmetric workpiece is described. A temperature gradient is provided between the periphery <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the workpiece and the centre of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In particular the periphery <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is heated to a higher temperature than the centre of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such that the thinning of the centre of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the invention are that the thinning, thickness, or strain distribution of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be precisely controlled, by controlling the heating and/or cooling of different regions of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This advantage enables thinner, and hence lower cost, workpieces to be used because the workpiece is thinned only in the required regions and in a more uniform manner within those regions. Alternatively, by making the deformation more uniform, and hence reducing the peak strain, greater mean strain rates may be applied to the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, leading to a reduction in manufacturing time and costs. In addition the localised heating of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the infra red beams and laser beams means that the back plate and die are not heated and therefore the back plate and die are lower cost and easier to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention the laser guns <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are scanned across the surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that the temperature of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at each point on the surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is allowed to oscillate over a predetermined temperature range. Additionally, the inert gas may be directed against the surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to increase the cooling rate to increase the oscillation rate. The oscillation of the temperature over the predetermined temperature range causes phase transformation superplasticity to occur in the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The predetermined temperature range is arranged to extend to a temperature greater than a phase transformation temperature of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to a temperature less than the phase transformation temperature of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In phase transformation superplasticity the relative amounts of the different phases in an alloy changes to allow superplastic deformation to occur under conditions of constant load. This enables a small amount of superplastic deformation to occur at each temperature cycle. The phase transformation superplasticity enables materials, which do not exhibit superplasticity to be superplastically formed, for example welded metals, welded alloys, coarse grain metals or alloys or metal matrix composites. The rate of deformation of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be constrained by the rate at which the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be cycled. The response time for the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is proportional to the square of the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The response time for the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> depends upon the heat transfer coefficient and the temperature of the inert gas. Thus heating and cooling both surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> increases the rate at which the workpiece <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be cycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The titanium alloy consisting of 6 wt % Al, 4 wt % V and the balance Ti, comprises alpha and beta phases below a temperature of about 950&deg; C. and comprises only beta phase above a temperature of about 950&deg; C. For the titanium alloy consisting of 6 wt % Al, 4 wt % V and the balance Ti, the temperature may be cycled between 760&deg; C. and 980&deg; C. or between 880&deg; C. and 1020&deg; C. to obtain the phase transformation superplasticity, or between other suitable temperatures one of which is above and one of which is below the phase transformation temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> For a 1 mm thick workpiece of titanium alloy 6 wt % Al, 4 wt % V and the balance Ti, the heating time is 0.33 seconds for single surface heating and 0.1 second for double surface heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to mirrors to direct the laser beam onto the workpiece, but it may be equally possible to arrange each laser gun in a carriage and to move the carriage in two mutually perpendicular directions. Alternatively, each laser beam may be directed using an optical fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to laser guns directing laser beams on only one surface of the workpiece it is equally possible to arrange for laser guns to direct laser beams on both surfaces of the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Any suitable number of laser guns may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Any suitable number of infra red lamps may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to laser guns and infra red lamps heating the workpiece, other suitable heaters may be provided to heat the workpiece without heating the die and/or back plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention is applicable to the superplastic forming of aluminium, aluminium alloys, magnesium, magnesium alloys, lead/tin alloys, iron alloys, nickel alloys for example IN718, metal matrix composite material, either fibre reinforced or particle reinforced, and ceramics. </paragraph>
