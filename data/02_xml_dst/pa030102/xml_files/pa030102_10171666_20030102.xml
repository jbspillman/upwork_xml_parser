<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an emptying unit for recovering bottom residue, particularly in drying filters, drying units, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known that the drying filters and drying units used in many industrial fields generally comprise a vessel or container that is constituted by a hood-like body which is closed, in a lower region, by a bottom that is monolithic with said body or is hermetically coupled thereto and above which the separator filter may optionally be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Inside the container there is usually an agitator, which after filtration and drying has ended allows the outward expulsion of the product by means of a hatch that generally opens at the lower lateral or bottom part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To prevent the agitator from damaging the filtering element or by scraping the bottom, from introducing possible contaminant particles in the dried product, the agitator must strictly remain spaced from the filter and from the bottom; accordingly, with currently known solutions a bottom residue remains inside the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This bottom residue must be recovered for various reasons; to avoid insufficient separation of batches of two different qualities from a product treatment, the product obtained by a previous process must be fully removed and the apparatus must be cleaned correctly in order to remove the dried product entirely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another reason for which it is necessary to remove the so-called bottom residue is that the residue, which very often has a high economic value, can be spoiled by the subsequent batch being processed, with an evident economical loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Currently, to perform recovery it is necessary to take particular precautions, such as the use of glove boxes or other systems that require protection for the operator, for the environment and for the product and always have very high costs and considerable dimensions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The aim of the present invention is to solve the above problems by providing an emptying unit for recovering bottom residue, particularly in drying filters, drying units and the like, that allows to remove completely the dried product and in particular the portion that remains between the lower level reached by the agitator and the filter or bottom of the container, without having to resort to complicated operations with considerable manual interventions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Within this aim, a particular object of the invention is to provide an emptying unit that allows total recovery of the bottom residue without compromising in any way the quality of the resulting product and without creating any kind of contamination toward the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an emptying unit which, by way of its particular constructive characteristics, is capable of giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an emptying unit for recovering bottom residue, particularly in drying filters, drying units and the like, that can be obtained easily starting from commonly commercially available elements and materials and is further competitive from a merely economical standpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by an emptying unit for recovering bottom residue, particularly in drying filters, drying units and the like, according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises, inside a container for treating and containing dried product, means for introducing a fluid for moving the bottom residue of the dried product, a discharge port being further provided which is controlled by a discharge valve interposed on a pneumatic circuit suitable to produce a circulation of fluid in output from said discharge port.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, a container is illustrated which is generally designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is constituted, in a per se known manner, by a hood-like body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided with a bottom <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is coupled hermetically to the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the case of drying filters, a conventional filtering element is provided above the bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Inside the container for treating and containing dried product <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> there is an agitator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is actuated also during the discharge of the dried product to a level at which it does not make contact with the bottom or with the optional filtering element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to provide a hatch <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for discharging the dried product until the agitator arrives proximate to the bottom or the filtering element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The particularity of the invention consists in providing fluid introducing means for introducing a fluid for moving or circulating the bottom residue of the dried product which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, are constituted by a plurality of balls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or rotating elements connected to input valves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that regulate the inflow of a fluid, generally an inert gaseous substance, which produces an adequate turbulence in the dried product that lies below the region that can be reached by the agitator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a different embodiment, the balls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be replaced with tori <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, constituted by one or more annular elements provided with nozzles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which are also connected to delivery valves, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for the controlled injection of a gaseous substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is possible to provide a combined system in which both the balls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the tori <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The fluid introducing means for introducing the movement fluid are connected to vertical translational motion means (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), so that they are lifted during the initial steps of the process inside the drying filter or drying unit, during which the product, dissolved in a liquid, is introduced in order to separate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The fluid introducing means are arranged in the upper part to prevent them, during the treatment step, i.e., the filtration, washing and drying step, from being struck by the product, with the possibility of clogging the various nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to a different embodiment, the fluid introducing means for introducing the movement fluid are constituted by fixed nozzles arranged in the upper part of the treatment chamber formed inside the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it has been found experimentally that by using a nozzle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a lower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> shaped like a frustum, that widens at the free end and is connected to an upper frustum-shaped portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that widens at an end or side opposite to the free end of portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> toward openings <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, it is possible to produce a continuous circulation of the gaseous substance. A calibrated air intake port <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided in the upper coupling part above said openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This type of nozzle is currently used to agitate liquids contained in tanks and before now it was not used to produce air recirculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to allow the outward expulsion of the product, in the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, preferably proximate to the bottom, there is a discharge port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is controlled by a discharge valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> interposed on a pneumatic circuit that produces a circulation of a fluid, generally a gaseous fluid, in the direction for flowing out of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, downstream of the discharge valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> there is a bag filter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a fan <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and/or compressor driven by a motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which feeds to recirculation a fluid that can be returned into the container by means of a recirculation delivery port <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Pneumatic circulation can be achieved both by applying pressure inside the container, so as to loosen and lift the product, and by using vacuum for evacuation; the pressure and the vacuum can be used either individually or selectively in combination; moreover, to facilitate circulation it is possible to provide an injection inlet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for a conveyance fluid downstream of the discharge valve in order to generate a Venturi effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The pressure for evacuation can be generated from above, from below, tangentially with respect to the bottom or tangentially with respect to the filtering element, and likewise the pressure can be applied also optionally from below in combination with an action from above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With the arrangement described above it is thus possible to provide a method suitable to empty the dried product completely, utilizing a movement of the product that constitutes the product residue that is obtained by introducing a gaseous substance by way of suitable nozzles that produce, in practice, a stream for conveying the product outward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It should be added to the above that it is possible to utilize pneumatic conveyance also to empty the container without performing preliminary emptying by means of the hatch, but by performing complete emptying with an initial step of pneumatic conveyance and a final step with pneumatic conveyance that also allows to remove the product left on the bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> All the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In practice, the materials used, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions, may be any according to requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The disclosures in Italian Patent Application No. MI2001A001351 from which this application claims priority are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
