<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system for discharging dried product, particularly for drying filters, drying units and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known that drying filters are generally structurally constituted by a container in which a solid portion is separated from a liquid in a closed chamber that can optionally be pressurized; the separated portion is thereafter subjected to streams of hot air and/or to heating from the chamber walls and to stirring from an agitator, so as to eventually dry the product within the same system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These drying filters have, in their lower part, a discharge hatch that is arranged either laterally or on the bottom thereof, is of the plug or swinging type, and can be opened for discharging the product that has to be transferred externally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve a good seal, discharge hatches are provided with an O-ring seal or a metal-to-metal seal that is particularly critical in operation, especially after discharging a first batch of separated product, since during discharge the hatches become soiled with the product and it is therefore necessary to perform accurate cleaning in order to ensure tightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To perform cleaning, it is necessary to resort to particular precautions, such as the use of glove boxes, which are expensive, or of other systems for protecting the operator or the environment, which involve very high costs and increased overall dimensions of the device that are difficult to meet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, another problem that can be observed with the discharge systems of the prior art consists in that the hatches that are currently used do not allow to perform a metered discharge, since they simply allow opening or closure, with consequent escape of the product without the possibility to regulate the quantity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The aim of the present invention is to solve the above mentioned drawbacks by providing a system for discharging dried product, particularly for drying filters, drying units and the like, that allows to facilitate the external discharge of the product without having to resort to a hatch-type opening, as instead occurs in the prior art, thus simplifying considerably the entire structure of the container and consequently reducing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Within this aim, an object of the invention is to provide a discharge system and method that allow to achieve an optimum product discharging, with the advantage of being able to adjust and meter at will the discharged quantity, since the opening and closure of a hatch is eliminated completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a discharge system that simplifies considerably all the cleaning and sealing operations, since the hatch remains completely unused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a discharge system that thanks to its particular constructive characteristics is capable of giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for discharging dried product, particularly for drying filters, drying units and the like, that can be obtained easily starting from commonly commercially available elements and materials and is furthermore competitive from a merely economical standpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by a system for discharging dried product, particularly for drying filters, drying units and the like, according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises, on a container for treating and containing a dried product, a discharge hole that is controlled by a discharge valve that is interposed on a pneumatic circuit suitable to produce a circulation of fluid in output from said discharge hole, an agitator being further provided which acts on said dried product.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further characteristics and advantages will become better apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred but not exclusive embodiment of a system for discharging dried product, particularly for drying filters, drying units and the like, illustrated only by way of non-limitative example with the aid of the accompanying drawing, wherein the sole figure is a schematic view of a drying filter to which the dried product discharge system according to the invention is applied.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figure, a container for treating and containing a dried product is shown and is generally designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; in a per se known manner, the container is formed by an upper body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> closed by a bottom <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> where the usual filtering mesh <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is optionally provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The particularity of the invention consists in that there is a discharge hole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controlled by a discharge valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is interposed on a pneumatic circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that produces a circulation of fluid inside the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so as to convey externally the dried product, which is stirred and moved by means of a conventional agitator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> arranged inside the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The discharge hole, as shown in the drawing, is located proximate to the bottom; its location can of course be defined depending on the various operating requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The invention has the aim of avoiding the use of the conventional hatch, which might be provided but not used, in the case of a container that is already commercially available, so as to be able to extract the dried product, generally in powder form, without encountering the kinds of problem that are typical of these devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In particular, a pneumatic conveyance is achieved which can be provided in various manners, with suction, pressure, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For this purpose there is an inlet valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for introducing the gaseous conveyance fluid in the container, and downstream of the discharge valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> there is a bag filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on which an electric fan <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or compressor acts which is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, in order to send the fluid toward a recovery duct <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that optionally can be connected back to the inlet valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The incoming gaseous fluid for conveying the product can be introduced in a combined and/or selected manner from above, from below, tangentially from the bottom or optionally directly from the filtering wall in the case of vertical drying units or drying filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Similar results can be obtained by providing and using only a vacuum environment to evacuate the product moved by the agitator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The fluid pressure can also be introduced or provided simply from below under the filtering wall or mesh <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or optionally it is possible to apply pressure from below and from above simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Generally, therefore, a system and method are provided which, by producing a pneumatic conveyance for discharging the dried product, allows to simplify considerably the structure, since it allows to eliminate the conventional hatch that is the source of many problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in order to provide enhanced fluid flowing of the product, downstream of the discharge valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> it is possible to inject a conveyance fluid <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> such as a pressurized gas, which produces a Venturi effect that facilitates conveyance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It should be added to the above that at the bag filter it is optionally possible to provide a backwashing inlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, functioning whereof being advantageously time-controlled so as to optimize the production cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> From the above description it is thus evident that the invention achieves the intended aim and objects, and in particular the fact is stressed that also a pneumatic conveyance method is provided in a way and with steps described above that is assuredly innovative for pneumatic conveyance and also according to a conceptual solution that is different from conventional pneumatic conveyances that use a star-type dosage valve, which in the present situation is useless if not a hindrance, since it might cause stagnation or damage to the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> All the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In practice, the materials used, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions, may be any according to requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The disclosures in Italian Patent Application No. MI2001A001352 from which this application claims priority are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
