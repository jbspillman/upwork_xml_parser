<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to feeding of web and sheet materials, and in particular to feeding of difficult web and sheet materials, such as bubble wrap, which cannot be conveyed by conventional feeding systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Feed systems for advancing web and sheet materials typically a drive roller situated above or below a nip roller. Either or both of the rollers is driven, and typically the rollers can have similar surface characteristics, with the material being advanced by a combination of pressure between the rollers and the surface friction of the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Difficult materials, such as bubble wrap, foam products, layered cloth and paper, and materials with adhesive backing normally cannot be fed in conventional systems. Either the material becomes skewed when passing between the rollers, because the material is uneven in cross-section, or, if the gap between the rollers is set to be too small, at least part of the material can be damaged. It is the object of the invention to develop a feeding system which easily accommodates difficult materials, and feeds them satisfactorily and consistently for downstream processing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention is a feeding system for difficult web and sheet materials, and comprises a flexible platen having a low friction transport surface. A drive roller having a high friction surface is situated above and spaced from the transport surface, forming a gap. Means is provided for adjusting the gap, and means is also provided for operating the drive roller to advance sheet and other materials between the drive roller and the transport surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the preferred form of the invention, the transport surface has a first coefficient of static friction and the high friction surface of the drive roller has a second coefficient of static friction. The coefficients of static friction differ by at least 0.5, and preferably by greater than at least 1.0. The transport surface has a coefficient of friction of from about 0.04 or less to about 0.25, therefore maintaining its low friction. The high friction surface has a coefficient of static friction of greater than about 0.75. To accommodate uniquely shaped materials, preferably the high friction surface is compressible in order to work in concert with the flexibility of the platen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the preferred form of the invention, the adjusting means comprises a screw adjustment. The screw adjustment comprises a pair of individually adjustable screws on opposite sides of the platen. The screws are mounted in the frame for the feeding system, and are engaged in a support for the platen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Operation of the drive roller can be conventional, and is preferably a motor connected in the normal fashion. The motor can be computer controlled, and can be constructed to work in combination with upstream or downstream feeding and handling apparatus.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE EMBODYING THE BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A feeding system according to the invention is depicted generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the drawing figures. The feeding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> spaced from the flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, forming a gap between the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The geometry of the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be reversed from that shown, as would be evident to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Both the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are mounted in a frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, only two portions of which are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be made of steel, aluminum or any other material of sufficient strength to mount and hold the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for their various functions, as described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which can be conventional, and which can include conventional controls. The motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be self contained, or can be formed to be connectable to other feeding and handling apparatus in line with the feeding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The type of the motor and its control, as well as its particular connection to the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are not part of the invention other than, of course, a motor is required for operating the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is flexible, and is made of appropriate material to impart the flexibility herein described. The flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> acts much like a spring, and is adjustable in relation to the roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of a screw adjustment comprising a pair of individually adjustable screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> engage a stiff platen support <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending beneath the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the adjustment of the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in relation to the roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be visually sighted by means of a gage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Adjustment of the screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be conventional, with respective manual adjustment knobs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> being illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a transport surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is of particularly low friction. It preferably has a coefficient of static friction of from 0.04 or less, to 0.25, depending on the material being fed by the feeding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Conversely, the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a high friction outer surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which has a relatively high coefficient of static friction. That coefficient of static friction may range from 0.75 to far greater than 1.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The material of the transport surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can vary, so long as it is of the low friction described and is durable. Materials such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, Teflon, nylon and the like can be employed. The material of the outer surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be any of a variety of thin materials which have an adequate coefficient of static friction. This would include rubber, urethane, some plastics, and even materials such as leather. The material of the outer surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be compressible, to further accommodate any uneven nature of the material being fed by the feeding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The principle of the invention is based upon having high friction between the drive roller and the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> being fed, and, conversely, as low friction as possible between the flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The invention relies somewhat on the force of squeezing between the driver roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and primarily on the frictional interface between the outer surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With the coefficients of static friction of the transport surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the outer surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being as set forth above, it is important that there be a differential between the coefficients of friction to permit proper feeding of the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The differential of the coefficients of static friction should be at least 0.5. A smaller differential between the coefficients of friction can lead to inconsistent feeding of the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, depending on the type of material being accommodated by the feeding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The flexible platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is semi-rigid, in that it provides upward force to permit contact between the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the outer surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The flexibility also accommodates variations in the depth dimension of the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> without damaging the material as it is being fed. As little upward pressure as possible is exerted by the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> sandwiched between the drive roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the platen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as the material is being fed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While the invention is particularly useful for feeding difficult web and sheet materials such as bubble wrap, foam, layered cloth and paper, and incompressible papers and plastics, with or without adhesive backings, it can also be used for feeding conventional sheet materials which can be fed by conventional double roll feeders. Various changes can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit thereof or scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
