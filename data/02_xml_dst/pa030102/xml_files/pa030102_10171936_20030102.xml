<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for making an automobile assembly having a moulded plastics structural member and a reinforcing member in which a polymerizable adhesive is employed to bond the two members together and an automobile assembly having a bonded structural member and a reinforcing member. The assembly is suitably used as a &ldquo;front end carrier&rdquo; or a bumper system in an automobile. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an automobile assembly, in particular to structural assemblies employed at the front end known as a &ldquo;front end carrier&rdquo; or rear end of an automobile and also to assemblies for use as bumper systems. The invention is especially concerned with automobile structural assemblies having a reinforcing member and a structural member which are connected together by means of an adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An automobile bumper system typically comprises a &ldquo;bumper beam&rdquo; and a &ldquo;bumper fascia&rdquo;. Typically the bumper beam is bolted to the chassis of the automobile and the fascia is connected to the body panels. An energy absorption unit is typically disposed between the fascia and beam. A bumper beam is typically made of a rigid material, for example steel and aluminium, to provide structural integrity and an impact reaction surface and may act as a reinforcing member in the bumper system. The &ldquo;bumper fascia&rdquo; is shaped so as to abut or to be connectable to the energy absorption unit and also to have aesthetic appeal, it being part of the external part of the bumper system. A &ldquo;bumper fascia&rdquo; may typically be made of or comprise a moulded plastics material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Energy absorption units (EAU) may be made of metal, for example steel and aluminium, or may be made of plastics material. The EAU compresses or distorts on impact so absorbing the energy of the impact. Conventional plastic bumper EAUs may be assembled for example by heating staking points so as to weld the plastics material of the EAU and the fascia together. This process may however leave undesirable visible marks on the fascia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The fascia may also be attached to the EAU using mechanical fixing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The EAU may be connected to the bumper beam or may be located close to but spaced from the beam. Typically, the EAU may be connected to the beam using mechanical fixing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the fascia and EAU or the EAU and bumper beam are connected at localised points, large stresses may be encountered at those points leading to failure in the event of a collision and less efficient absorption of energy along the length of the bumper system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;front end carrier&rdquo; (hereafter FEC) for an automobile is that part of the body of the automobile which joins the two sides of the front of the automobile together and is aligned transversely so as to enclose a front, typically engine, compartment. The FEC is shaped for aesthetic and functional purposes, and typically houses or is otherwise used to carry one or more of the lighting assemblies, the cooling system and the latch by which the bonnet is secured when closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> FEC&apos;s conventionally are made of at least two parts, a structural member and a reinforcing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Usually, the structural member, whether in an FEC or a bumper system, comprises a plastics material, for example polypropylene, glass filled polypropylene or polyamides, which lends itself to shaping in the desired form. The plastics part of the FEC or bumper system is conventionally produced by moulding using known techniques including compression moulding and injection moulding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In an FEC, the reinforcing member is employed to provide impact resistance, as well as providing structural benefits such as improved durability and stiffness. The reinforcement is typically made of a metal, for example steel and aluminium, but may be made from other materials capable of providing reinforcement. The reinforcing member is typically attached to the structural member by mechanical fixing, for example using bolts and screws. However mechanical fixing causes concentrations of stress at the fixing points between the plastic moulding and the reinforcement, which may cause the FEC to fail mechanically during durability testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to mechanical fixing in FEC&apos;s, the plastic moulding may be moulded around and interlock with the reinforcement for instance by way of providing holes in the reinforcements and forming the plastic moulding in situ so as to secure the two parts together. This process nevertheless is more expensive than assembling the plastic moulding and reinforcement using mechanical fixing and also provides less process flexibility. Furthermore, the design and effectiveness in use of the reinforcement may be compromised by having multiple holes and structurally less effective geometry which are needed to permit in situ formation of the plastic moulding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Traditional adhesives do not bond effectively to plastics materials of the type used in FECs and which may be used in bumper systems due to the low surface energy of the plastic materials. As such it is believed adhesives have not hitherto been employed for fabricating FECs, bumper systems and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Adhesives for use in bonding to low surface energy materials are however known. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,657 discloses adhesive compositions which are said to have excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates especially low surface energy polymers. The adhesive disclosed in this document relates to organoborane polyamine complexes and especially complexes wherein the polyamine is reaction product of dye primary amine terminated material and material having at least two groups reactive with primary amine with an excess of primary amine groups over groups reactive with primary amine. The complexes may be used in systems that initiate the polymerization of acrylic monomer to yield acrylic adhesive compositions. Such compositions are said to be useful for bonding low surface energy plastic or polymer substrates. U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,657 refers to organoborane amine complexes used in acrylic adhesives and which may be employed in structural and semi-structural applications including glass/metal bonding and bonding other types of materials together. Reference is made to bonding plastic to a range of types of materials of which one is metal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,065 relates to organoborane amine complexes and to acrylic adhesives that incorporate initiator systems based on such complexes. The adhesives are especially useful in bonding low surface energy substrates such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene. In the Examples in this document Examples 14 to 118 provide data concerning adhesion to a polyethylene substrate or a polytetrafluoro-ethylene substrate. Examples 121 to 125 additionally include reference to adhesion of a polypropylene substrate which is bonded to a substrate of the same material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> These prior art documents do not contemplate the use of adhesives to bond reinforcing components to plastic mouldings in automobile applications in which a combination of practical and technical criteria must be met. In particular, there is no indication in these documents that adhesives may be employed in FEC&apos;s or bumper systems which, by the nature of their use, are exposed to impact and high stresses and strains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In view of the widespread consumer use of automobiles, matters of safety, such as improved crash resistance, durability and stiffness of the FEC and robustness, resistance to heat, chemical inertness and recoverability in low speed impacts of bumper systems, together with cost and manufacturing flexibility are critical in the design and manufacture of automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The known technique of mechanical fixing of the reinforcing member to the plastic structural member has drawbacks as regards structural limitations, and stress concentrations and forming a component, for example an FEC and a bumper system by moulding the plastic in situ, for example through holes in the reinforcement, is costly and inflexible which may limit design options and also increase costs of production. Producing the components for use in FEC&apos;s and bumpers by in situ moulding around the reinforcement also requires the moulding tool to have a complementary design to the reinforcing component so any changes in the design of the reinforcing component require modifications to the moulding tool hence introducing further process complication and cost. A need remains therefore to improve the optimum combination of safety, cost and manufacturing flexibility. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> We have now found a method by which the reinforcing member may be attached to the plastic structural member in automobile assemblies such as FECs and bumper systems which ameliorates or removes the drawbacks associated with existing methods of producing them. By employing certain types of adhesive which are capable of bonding to low energy surfaces such as plastics materials used in FECs and bumper systems, the need for attachment through mechanical fixing or in situ formation of a plastic moulding around a reinforcing component may be reduced or avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention provides a method for producing an automobile assembly comprising a structural member made of a moulded plastics material having a low energy surface and a reinforcing member attached to the structural member, the members having complementary surfaces, which comprises applying an adhesive to the complementary surface of the structural member and/or reinforcing member, bringing the complementary surfaces of the reinforcing member and structural member into contact and allowing the adhesive to set so as to bond the structural member and reinforcing member together wherein the adhesive is capable of bonding to a low energy surface plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> By low energy surface plastic is meant materials that have a surface energy of less than 45 mJ/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, suitably less than 40 mJ/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and desirably less than 35 mJ/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>including, by way of example polypropylene and polyamide. If desired, the surface of the structural member and/or reinforcing member may be treated or primed to improve adhesion prior to application of the adhesive. Suitably the structural member is not subjected to treatment or priming and the adhesive is applied directly to the surface of the structural member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the invention provides for the use of an adhesive capable of bonding to a low energy surface substrate in the fabrication of an automobile assembly which comprises a structural member comprising a plastic moulding having a low energy surface and a reinforcing member to bond together the said moulding and reinforcing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, the invention provides an automobile assembly comprising a structural member made of a moulded plastics material having a low energy surface and a reinforcing member attached to the structural member, the structural member and reinforcing member having complementary surfaces and being attached by means of an adhesive, which is capable of bonding to a low energy surface substrate, on at least part of one or both of the complementary surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to any automobile assemblies in which a material is to be bonded to a low energy surface material for example &ldquo;front end&rdquo; systems and &ldquo;rear end&rdquo; systems and a bumper system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the invention permits the structural member and the reinforcing member to be attached after the structural member has been produced so avoiding the drawbacks of the known process in which the structural member is formed in situ. Thus the risk of having to alter the tools for producing the structural member if the reinforcing member design alters is reduced. Further, the design and hence structural effectiveness of the reinforcing member is not compromised by limitations on the geometry, shape or dimensions of the reinforcing member imposed by the tooling apparatus. The invention accordingly provides advantages as regards enhanced process flexibility, design of the assembly and cost. In addition reinforcements of a complex design may be employed to provide a higher level of reinforcement per unit weight of reinforcement. This arrangement may provide additional benefits as regards design flexibility, reduced weight with the advantages that flow from that.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the structural member and reinforcing member have complementary shapes, at least in part and they are bonded together by application of adhesive on either or both of the complementary parts of the members so as to bond the two parts together over an area which is significantly greater than the area associated with joining the parts by mechanical fixing. Advantageously, bonding the structural member and reinforcing member in this manner reduces the concentration of stress at the joints between the two members. Preferably, the structural member and reinforcing member are bonded together by a continuum of adhesive along the complementary surfaces on the two members in order to reduce the concentration of stress at a particular point when load is applied to the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The automobile assembly, for example a FEC and a bumper system, is suitably manufactured employing known techniques for producing the structural member for example compression or injection moulding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Suitably the structural member comprises a plastic moulding. The plastics material preferably comprises a homopolymer, for example a polyolefin, a polyamide, a polyphenylene oxide and polystyrene, or a copolymer, for example a polyalkylene terephthalate, having a low surface energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferred plastics materials include polypropylene, polyamide, polyamide alloys, polyphenylene oxide polymers, polyphenylene oxide alloys, polystyrene polymers, polystyrene alloys, polybutylene terephthalate polymers and polybutylene terephthalate alloys. The plastics material may contain fibre, for example short glass fibre, long glass fibre, short natural fibre or long natural fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Especially preferred plastics materials include short glass fibre filled polypropylene, long glass fibre filled polypropylene, glass filled polyamide and glass filled polyamide alloys.&mdash;Plastics materials which are especially preferred for use in bumper systems as the EAU include unfilled polypropylene, talc filled polypropylene, mineral filled polypropylene&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing member is suitably made of a metal, for example steel, zinc and aluminium, but may be made from other materials capable of providing reinforcement. The reinforcing member may be coated with materials typically employed in the manufacture of automobiles, for example anti-corrosion materials and primers for additional coatings such as paint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In an especially preferred embodiment of the invention in which the assembly is a FEC, the structural member is made from glass filled polypropylene and/or glass filled polyamide and the reinforcing member is made from steel or aluminium. In a further preferred embodiment, the assembly is a bumper system and the structural member is made from polypropylene and the reinforcing member is made from steel, aluminium or polypropylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a bumper system, the EAU is suitably disposed between the bumper fascia and the bumper beam. The EAU preferably has a generally &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped cross-section. The open ends of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped EAU may be connected to the beam and the opposite side of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; connected to the fascia or vice-versa by means of the adhesive. Where the EAU is connected to the beam by means of the adhesive, the EAU is the structural member and the beam the reinforcing member. Where the EAU is connected to the fascia by means of the adhesive, the fascia and EAU are for present purposes the structural member and reinforcing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing member and/or structural member may be provided with contours or channels which are complementary with the surface of the other member so as to provide improved contact and alignment between the structural and reinforcing members. Shaping the members suitably provides enhanced resistance to stresses as the adhesion between the members may be supplemented by physical abutment depending on the direction in which the stress is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The adhesive employed in the present invention must be able to bond a low energy surface substrate and also act to bond a second substrate to the low energy surface substrate and, preferably is a polymerizable composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a preferred method the structural member and reinforcing member are bonded together by providing an adhesive comprising a polymerizable composition, contacting together the components of the adhesive under conditions for initiating polymerization of the adhesive, applying the adhesive to the complementary surface of the structural and/or reinforcing member, bringing the complementary surfaces of the reinforcing member and structural member into contact and curing the adhesive so as to bond the said members together. Initiating polymerization of the adhesive may be carried out prior to or after application of the adhesive to one or both members or during application or as a result of application of the adhesive to one or both members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the adhesive comprises a polymerizable composition comprising an organoborane/amine complex and one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization. Optionally, the adhesive may additionally comprise a compound which causes the said complex to disassociate so as to release the borane to initiate polymerization of one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation. Where a compound which causes the complex to disassociate is employed, it is kept separate from the complex until initiation of polymerization is desired. The polymerizable composition which contains the disassociating agent may be cured at any desired temperature, such as at, or near, ambient temperature and below ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An especially preferred embodiment of the invention provides an automobile assembly comprising a structural member made of a moulded glass filled polypropylene and/or glass filled polyamide having a surface energy of less than 45 mJ/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and a reinforcing member made from steel, zinc and/or aluminium attached to the structural member, the structural member and reinforcing member having complementary surfaces and being attached by means of an adhesive which is capable of bonding to a substrate having a surface energy of less than 45 mJ/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>disposed between at least part of the complementary surfaces so as to bond them together, the adhesive being derived from a polymerizable composition comprising </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> i) an organoborane/amine complex; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> ii) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; and, optionally </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> iii) a compound which causes the said complex to disassociate so as to release the borane to initiate polymerization of one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In fabricating the assembly, the adhesive composition is suitably applied to one or both of the members in those areas which are to be joined. The adhesive is suitably cured at ambient temperature and curing preferably is initiated prior to the members being brought together. The members are then suitably contacted while the adhesive remains able to bond the two members, for example, as the adhesive becomes tacky. If desired, the members may be held in place by mechanical means for example, snap-fits, mechanical fasteners or temporary clips. The surfaces are suitably clean and substantially free of foreign materials, for example fats, oils and water. The complementary surfaces may become adhered together relatively quickly so allowing the bonded assembly to be handled, for example on an automobile production line.

Subsequently, the adhesive continues to cure to provide a bond of maximum strength after 10 to 30 hours. The process is suitably carried out at ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As desired, mechanical fixing may be employed in addition to adhesive bonding to hold the structural member and the reinforcing member together. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The structural member (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is also provided with side channels (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and the reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is provided with lips (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) which engage with the side channels (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) in a complementary manner. The surfaces of the channels (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and lips (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) may be bonded by the provision of adhesive between the respective surfaces. Alternatively, these surfaces may not be bonded but in any event provide physical abutment between the respective parts of the structural member (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to enhance resistance to impact in the direction C, that is from the front of the automobile and to provide improved alignment between the members (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) during assembly. </paragraph>

The adhesive (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) is preferably applied to either or both the structural member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) at all points at which they are in contact. Alternatively, the reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) may have lips (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) to which adhesive (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) is applied and which are then contacted with the structural member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, neither the reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) nor the structural member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) need have lips. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the structural member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) is an EAU and is made of a polypropylene moulding. The bumper fascia (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) is spaced apart from member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and connected through conventional means to another part of the vehicle (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, the bumper fascia is the structural member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). The &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped EAU is the reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) and is made of steel. The member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is spaced apart from the bumper beam (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is bonded to the bumper fascia (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Suitably, the generally &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped component as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (structural member (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>)) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> (reinforcing member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>)) provides excellent impact resistance properties. Once assembled, the open end of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; section is closed by being bonded to the bumper beam (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the bumper fascia (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and is located next to, but not bonded to, the bumper beam (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> so creating a closed box section. The thickness of the box section and the thickness of the walls defining the box section determine the stiffness of the assembly and the performance of the assembly under impact. The horizontal walls, that is the top and bottom part of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped component may be designed to buckle under a certain load. This enables the impact resistance of the assembly to be tailored according to the intended use. The height of the box section, that is the length of the back part of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped component may be tailored to provide desired properties according to the intended use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Use of an EAU having a &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped cross section is especially advantageous in that the box shaped cross section formed on assembling the bumper system possesses excellent strength characteristics when subjected to impact. </paragraph>
