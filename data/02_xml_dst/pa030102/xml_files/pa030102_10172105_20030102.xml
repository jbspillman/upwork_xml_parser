<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a transmission control strategy. More particularly, it relates to a variable shift schedule control strategy that allows an automatic transmission to make clutch engagements variably, thereby resulting in ratio changes at lowered engine speeds and earlier torque converter element locks while maintaining relatively constant output torque. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Worldwide demand for vehicles that perform under greater fuel economy and produce fewer environmental pollutants has spurred the automotive industry to research and produce vehicles with alternative power-train architectures, including the hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV). Most HEV power-trains have two separate modes of producing torque and power, a conventional internal combustion engine and an electric motor powered by some type of electrical energy storage unit, such as a battery. Generally, the HEV has been successful in delivering greater fuel economy and lowered emissions than conventional internal combustion engines by utilizing a downsized internal combustion engine and augmenting the engine torque through the electric motor when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Among the disadvantages of known power-train architectures for HEVs are relatively low performance values in torque, horsepower and acceleration. In order to overcome these disadvantages, particularly in large vehicles that are subject to more demanding duty cycles such as towing, it is known that a sizeable electric motor, typically 25 kW or greater, and comparably large energy storage units could be utilized to meet higher torque and power demands. However, the weight penalty for these larger electric motors and energy storage units would largely offset the benefits typically associated with the HEV, including increased fuel economy and lowered emissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the area of alternative HEV power-train architectures, there continues to be a need for a control strategy that allows the power-train to generate increased torque and power while still providing lowered emissions and increased fuel economy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram showing a power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for implementing a variable shift schedule control strategy according to the present invention in a hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV). The HEV power-train system includes a conventional internal combustion (IC) engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an engine crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an automatic transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a set of drive wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The engine crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fluidly coupled to the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a torque converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the drive wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through a differential gear mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for transmitting the driving torque produced by the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the drive wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as is well known in the art. A transmission controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> controls the operation of the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> further includes an electric motor preferably comprising an integrated starter alternator (ISA) motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and at least one electric energy storage device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can function as a direct current electric motor or as a synchronous alternator generating AC electric power for sourcing electrical loads. The ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a rotor that is preferably mounted directly on the engine crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the torque converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be energized from the electric energy storage device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to assist the torque output of the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Additionally, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be connected to the engine crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in alternative ways, for example, via a mechanical rotation transmitting device such as a chain drive, a belt drive or a gear train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For example, one HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been found useful includes a 4.0 liter, six cylinder gasoline engine and a 42 volt, 3 phase inverter fed induction type Integrated Starter Alternator manufactured by Visteon Corp. of MI, USA having a capacity less than about 10 kW. The Integrated Starter Alternator is powered by three series wired 12V Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) batteries. The HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> further includes a torque converter having a diameter of about 260 mm, a stall torque ratio of about 2.25, and a capacity factor (K) of about 184. Also, the power-train system includes a 5 speed electronic controlled transmission having the following gear ratios:

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, the HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> utilized in the present embodiment has a final drive ratio of about 3.73 and tires for the drive wheels having about 722 revolutions per mile. However, it should be understood that the parameters for the HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described above are meant to be illustrative, rather than limiting. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other power-train systems could also implement the variable shift schedule control strategy according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one embodiment of a variable shift schedule (VSS) control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for making clutch engagements to change gear ratios during an up-shift (changing from a higher gear ratio to a lower gear ratio) or to lock the torque converter elements will be explained. The VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is implemented in the transmission controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As described in further detail below, the VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> selectively utilizes additional torque available from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to allow the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be consistently operated at reduced speeds during an up-shift sequence by changing gear ratios within the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> coupled with locking the elements of the torque converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> earlier than traditionally thought acceptable and still produce comparable output torque during light duty usages. When called upon by the operator for heavier usage duty cycles, the VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can utilize the full performance of the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along with the additional torque available from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This produces a power-train architecture that has increased fuel efficiency, lowered emissions and higher performance levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With the advent of fully electronic transmission controls, calibration engineers have been given the ability to continuously define gear ratio change and torque converter element locking parameters for a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Traditionally, one gear ratio change parameter is established for each gear ratio shift sequence (a change between consecutive gear ratios) through the creation of a table or shift schedule that sets a pair of engine variables relating to vehicle performance against each other. A typical shift schedule will set vehicle speed against throttle position (driver demand), for example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a conventional shift schedule <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for four gear ratio up-shift sequences by plotting throttle position, measured in percent open, against vehicle speed, measured in miles per hour. Likewise, one torque converter lock parameter is established for each torque converter lock and unlock sequence, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A typical control system uses the gear ratio change parameters chosen by the calibrator to determine the vehicle speed at which a transmission should change gear ratios for a given throttle position. Specifically, during an up-shift sequence, any time the vehicle speed is above the value for which it was calibrated at the given throttle position, the control system requests a change to the next higher consecutive gear ratio. Referring to the example of the conventional shift schedule <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> transmission will shift from first to second gear at a throttle position of 40% open once the vehicle speed climbs above about 28 mph. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a typical control system uses the torque converter lock parameters to determine the vehicle speed at which a transmission should lock the torque converter elements. By &ldquo;locking&rdquo; the torque converter, the engine crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mechanically coupled directly to the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> first defines <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> a variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that includes a pair of gear ratio change parameters for each gear ratio up-shift sequence, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In effect, the VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> defines a variable shift schedule that allows the calibrator to create a variable range to command the shifting from a current gear ratio to the next gear ratio by utilizing two gear ratio change points for a given vehicle speed and throttle position. The variable shift schedule also includes a pair of torque converter lock parameters for each torque converter lock sequence, creating a variable range to command the locking of the torque converter elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>display a variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that was found useful in conjunction with the HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described above. Again, the gear ratio change and torque converter lock parameters are defined by a pair of variables relating to vehicle performance, including vehicle speed and throttle position. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can define the gear ratio change and torque converter lock parameters using other performance based parameters, for example, engine speed or engine torque output instead of vehicle speed and pedal position instead of throttle position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In particular, for each gear ratio up-shift sequence, the variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes an IC gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, VSS gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, IC torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and VSS torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The IC gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the IC torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> preferably define a set of gear ratio change points and a set of torque converter lock points respectively that are utilized in a conventional power-train architecture having an IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> only. The VSS gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> preferably defines a set of lower gear ratio change points that allow the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to up-shift gear ratios at lower vehicle speeds. The VSS torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> preferably defines a set of lower torque converter lock points that allow the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to lock the torque converter elements at lower vehicle speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As described below, a reduction in the speed of the IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during a gear ratio change and, conversely, the ability of the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to remain in higher gear ratio ranges for longer durations, coupled with torque converter elements that can be locked more often, creates a power-train having increased efficiency and lowered emissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> displays the pair of gear ratio change parameters <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> from the variable shift schedule 52 that are utilized for a &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift. The upper curve that intercepts the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis at about 16 mph represents the conventional IC gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> utilized in conventional power-train architecture having an IC engine only. The lower curve that intercepts the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis at 12 mph describes the earliest VSS gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for the HEV power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At a throttle position setting of about 30%, the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would shift from second gear to third gear when the vehicle reaches about 32 mph, according to the IC gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Similarly, at a throttle position setting of about 30%, the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could shift from second gear to third gear when the vehicle reaches about 29 mph, according to the earliest VSS gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The corresponding difference in speed of the IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be calculated according to the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the 3 mph difference between the vehicle speeds at which the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> performs a &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift translates into a reduction of speed for the IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from about 3340 rpm to about 3025 rpm in the present embodiment, where a torque converter speed ratio of 0.8:1 is assumed. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this reduction in engine speed would result in a decrease in fuel consumption of approximately 1 kg/hour for the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilized in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Similarly, at a throttle position setting of about 30%, the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would lock the torque converter elements while in third gear only if the vehicle reaches about 66 mph, according to the IC torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could lock the torque converter elements while in third gear when the vehicle reaches about 30 mph at a throttle position setting of about 30% using the earliest VSS torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;locking&rdquo; the torque converter earlier, the engine is brought to the same speed as the transmission while torque multiplication through the torque converter is eliminated. When the torque converter elements are locked together rather than fluidly coupled, slippage is eliminated and the transfer of energy from the engine to the drive wheels becomes more efficient. Therefore, the power-train system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be more efficient over a greater range of vehicle speeds when using the VSS torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For example, the histogram charts shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate the increase in engine operating efficiency points over an entire drive cycle for the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilized in the present embodiment when utilizing the variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> instead of the corresponding conventional shift schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> However, simply lowering the vehicle speed and thus the engine speed at which the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> changes gear ratios or locks the torque converter elements could impact the overall performance of the vehicle, in particular, the output torque or tractive effort available at the drive wheels of the vehicle. The tractive effort is calculated using the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>TE&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>Enet</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*TR*GR*FDR, </italic></highlight>where </in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the net engine torque, T<highlight><subscript>Enet</subscript></highlight>, can be obtained from known tables setting engine torque against engine speed for a particular type of internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For example, the difference in tractive effort that occurs when the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> performs the &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift discussed above using the variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The negatively sloping delta curve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> corresponds to the tractive effort generated when the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> performs the &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift using the conventional IC gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> at an engine speed of about 3340 rpm. It shows a decrease in tractive effort of about 65 ft-lb. A vehicle operator will perceive this decrease in torque as a loss of vehicle power. The negatively sloping curve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> illustrates a decrease in output torque of about 75 ft-lb for an engine speed of 3025 rpm corresponding to the lowered shift point of the VSS ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> during the &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift. This increased drop in output torque results in a decreased acceleration rate for the vehicle. As a result, an operator would perceive an even greater loss in power for the vehicle using the VSS ratio change point as compared to the conventional shift point. It should be noted that these calculations assumed a torque converter speed ratio of approximately 0.8:1 pre-shift and 0.7:1 post-shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is desirable that the VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provide at least a constant tractive effort during clutch engagements to change gear ratios and lock the torque converter elements in order to maintain an approximately smooth acceleration during the ratio change. Accordingly, each VSS gear ratio change parameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and VSS torque converter lock parameter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the variable shift schedule <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> preferably defines gear ratio change points and a torque converter lock points such that a fully energized ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could provide sufficient boost torque to augment the torque output of the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to maintain an approximately constant tractive effort during the gear ratio change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates the torque curve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> used in the present embodiment. Following the gear ratio change for a &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift in the present embodiment, the speed of the IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be calculated as explained above and is about 2730 rpm. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the torque produced by the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at this speed is about 10 lb-ft, which translates into an additional tractive effort of 65 lb-ft. Referring next to the relatively flat curve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the additional tractive effort from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> results in a relative constant tractive effort or output torque <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for the HEV power-train system during the &ldquo;2-3&rdquo; up-shift sequence, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Therefore, as a result of the additional torque available from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the HEV power-train system can provide an approximately constant rate of acceleration for the vehicle during a proposed gear ratio change, which is then essentially unperceivable by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> However, the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may not always produce torque at its full capacity. The amount of torque that can be produced by the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is directly related to the capability of the electric energy storage device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to deliver electric energy. Therefore, the torque available from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is limited by the state of charge (SOC) of the electric energy storage device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> monitors the SOC as described below in order to select the optimal point for making a clutch engagement variably between the IC and VSS gear ratio change parameters <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as well as the IC and VSS torque lock parameters <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in order to determine whether the transmission should make clutch engagements for changing gear ratios or locking the torque converter elements based on the variable shift schedule defined at <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the transmission controller reads the present vehicle speed and present throttle position <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The moving speed of the vehicle is measured using a vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, such as an encoder mounted on at least one of the drive wheels of the vehicle. The throttle position, which is indicative of the torque demanded by the driver, is measured using a throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or a pedal sensor for measuring the distance traveled by the throttle pedal of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The transmission controller then compares the present vehicle speed with the vehicle speed value from the variable shift schedule corresponding to the VSS gear ratio change parameter and the VSS torque converter lock parameter at the measured throttle position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The transmission controller also compares the present vehicle speed with the vehicle speed value corresponding to the IC gear ratio change parameter and the IC torque converter lock parameter at the measured throttle position <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the present vehicle speed is in a range greater than the calibrated vehicle speed value corresponding to the IC torque converter lock parameter, the transmission controller simply locks the torque converter elements for the present gear <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Likewise, if the present vehicle speed is in a range greater than the calibrated vehicle speed value corresponding to the IC gear ratio change parameter, the transmission controller simply initiates an up-shift to the next gear ratio <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> However, if the present vehicle speed falls in the range between the calibrated values for the IC and VSS gear ratio change parameters, the VSS control strategy determines whether it can utilize the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to sufficiently augment the torque produced by the IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the proposed gear ratio change, as described in more detail below. Similarly, if the present vehicle speed falls in the range between the calibrated values for the IC and VSS torque converter lock parameters, the VSS control strategy determines whether the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could sufficiently augment the torque produced by the IC engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> if the elements of the torque converter are locked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> First, the transmission controller determines the additional boost or torque needed to maintain an approximately constant rate of acceleration for the HEV during the proposed gear ratio change or torque converter lock sequence <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by calculating the difference in tractive effort or output torque produced from the engine prior to and after the proposed clutch engagement. In order to calculate present output torque, the transmission controller calculates the present engine torque from the present engine speed using a lookup table containing engine torque data measured against engine speed. The present engine speed can be measured using a motor speed sensor, such as an encoder mounted on or near the engine crankshaft, or it can be calculated from the present vehicle speed measured at step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The transmission controller also calculates the engine speed and engine torque available following the proposed gear change using known gear ratio parameters and the data from an engine torque lookup table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the transmission controller obtains a value indicative of the state of charge (SOC) of the electric energy storage device <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The state of charge of the electric energy storage device, which is indicative of the percentage or the ratio of the energy remaining as compared to the energy in a fully charged device, can be measured using a current sensor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The amount of torque available from the ISA motor is calculated using the measured SOC based on known algorithms. The transmission controller then determines whether the amount of torque available from the ISA motor is sufficient to match the additional boost necessary to maintain an approximately constant rate of acceleration during the proposed gear ratio change or torque converter lock sequence <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If the boost capacity of the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is insufficient to maintain a constant rate of acceleration, the transmission controller returns to read the throttle position and vehicle speed <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> without performing the proposed clutch engagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> However, if the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can provide sufficient boost torque in the amount necessary to augment the engine torque and maintain the output torque approximately steady, then the transmission controller initiates the proposed clutch engagement to change a gear ratio or lock the torque converter elements <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, the transmission controller energizes the ISA motor to provide the additional boost torque <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It then waits for a predetermined amount of time and begins to ramp down the boost torque from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by reducing its torque output linearly to the increase of engine output torque. In order to ramp down the boost torque, the transmission controller calculates the present engine torque, waits for a predetermined amount of time, and calculates the present engine torque again. It then reduces the amount of boost torque from the ISA motor by the difference in the measured engine torque until the engine torque reaches a steady level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the VSS control strategy <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is able to interpolate the earliest point within the variable shift schedule for changing a gear ratio or locking the elements of the torque converter while still providing consistent vehicle acceleration. By taking full advantage of the ISA motor&apos;s torque producing capability, the VSS control strategy provides increased fuel economy and lowered emissions for the vehicle while also providing considerable torque when required to do so by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a VSS control strategy can utilize a variable shift schedule for down shifting the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (changing from a lower gear ratio to a higher gear ratio). For example, a VSS control strategy could selectively utilize additional torque available from the ISA motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to allow the engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be consistently operated at reduced speeds during a down-shift by changing gear ratios within the transmission <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> later than traditionally thought acceptable and still produce a smooth de-acceleration of the vehicle and comparable output torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the transmission controller in the alternative embodiment could prevent a down-shift once the vehicle speed drops below a conventional IC gear ratio change parameter for a down-shift sequence. Instead, the transmission controller could keep the transmission engaged in the higher gear (corresponding to a lower gear ratio) and thus keep the engine at a lower speed until the vehicle speed drops below a lower VSS gear ratio change parameter. In addition, the transmission controller could instruct the ISA motor to provide boost torque sufficient to maintain the tractive effort constant following the down-shift at the lower vehicle speed. </paragraph>
