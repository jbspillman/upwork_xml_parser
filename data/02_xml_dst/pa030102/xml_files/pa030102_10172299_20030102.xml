<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention, in general, relates to an apparatus for connecting polymeric tapes or the end portions thereof by heat welding and, more particularly, to an apparatus of the kind provided with a tongue-shaped or cantilevered temperature controlled welding head mounted on a pivotable arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. The Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For purposes of reducing their weight as well as to prevent their rupture during transport, packing materials such as, for instance, crates, boxes and the like are often tied together or secured by polymeric ribbons or tapes. It is important that the tapes are tautly drawn and that their ends are securely connected. Furthermore, when packaging large quantities of items it is also important that the cycle times for tying or taping the boxes be as short as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Commonly used polymeric packing tapes or ribbons may be securely connected by heat-welding or fusing and pressing. Relatively large heating device are required nowadays for heating the connecting spots. Such devices tend to be expensive as a result of their structural complexity as well as high power consumption. Heat dissipation in particular leads to power losses and heating of machine components. In addition, their heavy weight mitigates against convenient insertion of their welding head between the tapes at the connecting spot thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a simplified and compact apparatus for forming localized connections between polymeric tapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide a compact apparatus for heat connecting polymeric tapes which is of low structural complexity and low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Yet another object is to provide a tape welding apparatus of the kind which quickly reaches a stable operating temperature. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the accomplishment of these and other objects the invention provides for a tape welding apparatus provided with a welding head and thermostat housed in a flat tube and associated with means disposed on the pivot arm ahead of the welding head for controlling the heat thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A welding head structured in this fashion may be pivoted directly between tapes to be connected control module for heating the connection spot. To this end the heat of the welding head may be controlled such that it corresponds to given requirements even at short cycle times for taping up large numbers of boxes in the shortest possible time. Heat and energy losses are very low since heat is only generated where it is required for welding the tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> By comparison with conventional equipment of this kind in which the temperature control is remote from the welding head and connected therewith by a highly flexible and expensive connecting cable, the apparatus in accordance with the invention is provided with a heat control module rigidly connected to the welding head. Possible defects in the transmission of very low user voltages in the millivolt range of the thermostat are thus effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment the invention the control module is connected to a source of voltage and to the welding head and thermostat, and a potentiometer is provided for controlling the temperature of the welding head. The control module may be very compact and for the feed voltage it requires but a simple and cheap cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further embodiment, the control module controls the temperature as a function of the voltage. In this manner, voltage fluctuations cannot lead to temperature fluctuations of the welding head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another advantageous embodiment of the invention the thermostat for detecting the heating temperature is mounted between insulating materials on a heating coil. For temperature distribution the heating coil is housed in a heat conducting sleeve. Accordingly, the welding temperature may be measured directly at the welding site.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> welding head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is structured in the manner of a tongue and is mounted on one arm of an angular bracket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The other arm of the bracket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is in turn affixed to a pivot arm <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the tongue <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be pivoted between two ends <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a polymeric tape to be welded together. The other arm of the bracket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> also supports a control module <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a cable <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by which the control module <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a source of voltage (not shown). The cable <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is connected to the control module <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at a terminal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The welding head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the control module by conduits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A potentiometer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided for controlling the heat of the welding head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Two light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided for monitoring the function of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts the conduits <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by which the control module <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a heating coil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provided for heating the welding head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A thermostat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for detecting the heating temperature is connected to the control module <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by conduits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The thermostat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is seen to be arranged between conventional insulating materials <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> directly over the heating coil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The heating coil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is seated between insulating material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> within a heat conductive sleeve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The heating coil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and its layers of insulating material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as well as the thermostat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with its layers of insulating material <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are preferably press-fitted into a flat tubular member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The forward end of the flat tubular member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is sealed by a closure <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided for mounting the welding head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the bracket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The components depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have been drawn on an enlarged scale. The thickness of an actual flat tubular member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the tape material <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is about 0.08&Prime; (2 mm). Accordingly, any mass to be moved is very small and the heating-up time is no more than a few seconds. This leads to a reduced energy consumption as the welding head need only be energized for the short time required to weld the tapes together. The short heat-up time also ensures short cycle times.</paragraph>
