<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a linear motor drive for raising and lowering elevator cars. In particular, the present invention provides for the independent operation of multiple elevator cars operating in a single elevator shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2.Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional elevator systems typically employ hoisting ropes or hydraulic pistons and cylinders as a hoisting means. In a roped system, one end of the hoist rope is connected to the top of an elevator car. The rope passes over a drive sheave, which is powered by a conventional rotating motor, and the other end of the rope is connected to a counterweight. In general, this arrangement does not allow more than one car to operate in one elevator shaft. Likewise, hydraulic elevator systems are limited to one car per shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These conventional elevator systems have certain drawbacks. First, they require a great deal of otherwise useable building space. It has been estimated that approximately thirty percent of a the total space of a typical 100 story building is taken up by conventional elevators, shafts, halls, and machine rooms. Thus, it would be advantageous to reduce the number of elevator shafts without reducing the number of elevator cars available for passenger travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Second, conventional roped or hydraulic elevator systems have a limited travel height. Hydraulic elevators are generally limited to about 6 stories. Roped elevator systems are limited to about 1980 feet because above that length, the hoist rope can no longer support its own weight. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows multiple elevator cars to operate at different speeds and directions in a single elevator shaft. A linear motor primary element is installed in the shaft, usually in conjunction with elevator guide rails. The primary element is electrically connected to a source of substantially constant frequency alternating current (&ldquo;AC&rdquo;). A plurality of elevator cars reside and operate in the shaft. Each car has a variable speed linear motor drive apparatus affixed to it. The variable speed linear motor drive apparatus comprises linear motor secondary element that is electromagnetically coupled with the linear motor primary element. The linear motor secondary element is electrically connected in series with a run contact and a linear motor control apparatus. The linear motor control apparatus comprises a resistor and an electronic speed controller, such as a silicon triac based solid state speed controller, electrically connected in parallel with each other to form a control apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because elevator car speed and direction is a function of the current flow through the linear motor secondary element, the present invention also provides a method for independently controlling the speed of each of a plurality of elevator cars operating in an elevator shaft. The method comprises closing the run contact, which because of the resistor allows minimal current to flow through the coil of the secondary element. In one embodiment, the control device is then pulse width modulated to cause current to flow through the control device. In another embodiment, speed may be controlled by varying the resistance of the resistor.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of elevator cars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> operating in a single elevator shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be outfitted with a variable speed linear drive motor apparatus. The linear motor primary element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is mounted in the elevator shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, typically along elevator guide rails, and is electrically connected to a source of substantially constant frequency alternating current electric power. Typically, the electric power will be three phase electric power. However, in some situations single phase power will be adequate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the linear drive motor apparatus comprises a linear motor secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The linear motor secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is electromagnetically coupled with a linear motor primary element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The primary element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is the linear motor counterpart to the stator in a rotary motor and the secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the counterpart to the rotor. The linear motor secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be a wound coil type secondary element, or it may contain both permanent magnets and coils. The linear motor secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected in series with a run contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a linear motor control apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The linear control apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> comprises an electronic speed controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is suitable for use in controlling inductive loads, such as for example a silicon triac based speed controller, and a resistor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are electrically connected in parallel with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In operation, the run contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is closed. The resistor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows only minimal current to flow through the linear motor secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. One of the functions of the resistor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to control transient voltages associated with opening an inductive circuit, such as the one formed by the secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Current flow through the secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a function of the percentage of time that the speed controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a conducting mode. One method of controlling the speed controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is through pulse width modulation (&ldquo;PWM&rdquo;). In this method, current flow is a function of pulse width. Another method of controlling current flow through the linear motor secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to vary the resistance of the resistor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The speed and direction of the elevator car is directly related to the current flow through the secondary element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In any elevator system, gravity plays an important role. When an elevator car is moving upward, kinetic energy is converted to potential energy. When an elevator car is moving downward, potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. If mechanical brakes are used to control the speed of a downward moving car, the kinetic energy is converted to heat, which is not recoverable. In the elevator system of the claimed invention which employs linear drive motors, it is possible to convert the kinetic energy from a downward moving car into electrical energy. The linear motor acts as a generator when the elevator car is traveling downward and the generated electric power can either be stored or returned to a power supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Since the above described elevator system allows an elevator car to control its own speed independently and without the need to vary the frequency or voltage in the linear motor primary element, multiple cars can operate in a single shaft. In order to avoid collisions between elevator cars, the cars must be capable of horizontal movement. Elevator cars should also be capable of allowing passengers or cargo to be loaded and unloaded when the car is outside of the shaft. Once loaded, the car is transported to the shaft and connected to rails. In the case of elevator cars that must pass each other, one car can slow down, move horizontally, and permit the other car to pass it. The passed car is then returned to the shaft and resumes its vertical movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, the elevator system contains an up shaft for upward moving cars and a down shaft for downward moving cars. When a car reaches the top or bottom of the shaft it travels horizontally to the other shaft. </paragraph>
