<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>TECHNICAL FIELD</italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of cathodes and rechargeable electric current producing cells.  More particularly, the present invention pertains to solid composite cathodes which comprise (a) an electroactive sulfur-containing material which, in its oxidized state, comprises a polysulfide moiety of the formula, -S<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>-, wherein m is an integer from 3 to 10; and, (b) a non-electroactive particulate material having a strong adsorption of soluble polysulfides.  This strongly adsorbing particulate material significantly reduces or retards the diffusion of sulfur-containing electroactive materials from the cathode into the electrolyte and other cell components when incorporated into the cathode of an electric current producing cell.  The present invention also pertains to electric current producing cells comprising such composite cathodes, and methods of making such solid composite cathodes and electric current producing cells.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Throughout this application, various publications, patents, and published patent applications are referred to by an identifying citation.  The disclosures of the publications, patents, and published patent applications referenced in this application are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As the rapid evolution of portable electronic devices continues, the need for safe, long-lasting, high capacity rechargeable batteries becomes increasingly evident.  Under such circumstances, high energy density lithium secondary batteries are rapidly being developed that will eventually replace the conventional lead acid, nickel-cadmium, and nickel metal hydride batteries in many applications.  In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing high energy density cathode active materials and alkali metals as anode active materials for high energy density lithium secondary batteries to meet these needs.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Lithium and sulfur are highly desirable as the electrochemically active materials for the anode and cathode, respectively, of rechargeable or secondary battery cells because they provide nearly the highest energy density on a weight (2500 Wh/kg) or volume (2800basis possible of any of the known combinations of materials.  To obtain high energy densities, the lithium can be present as the pure metal, in an alloy or in an intercalated form, and the sulfur can be present as elemental sulfur or as a component in an organic or inorganic material with a high sulfur content, preferably greater than 50 weight per cent sulfur.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, anodes containing the element lithium in any form are referred to as lithium-containing anodes.  Cathodes containing the element sulfur in any form are hereinafter referred to as sulfur-containing cathodes.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Many battery systems comprising alkali metal containing anodes and sulfur-containing cathodes have been described.  Exemplary of high temperature cells incorporating molten alkali metal anodes and molten sulfur cathodes separated by a solid electrolyte are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,993,503, 4,237,200 and 4,683,179.  For operation, these storage cells must be heated to temperatures greater than about 320 &deg;C.  Of considerable recent interest are cells comprising alkali metal anodes and cathodes containing elemental sulfur that operate at considerably lower temperatures, particularly those with solid cathodes operating at ambient temperatures.  Rechargeable lithium sulfur battery cells operating at room temperature have been described by Peled <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> in<highlight><italic> J. Power Sources</italic></highlight>, <highlight><italic>1989,</italic></highlight><highlight><italic> 26</italic></highlight>, 269-271, wherein the solid sulfur-containing cathodes are comprised of a porous carbon loaded with elemental sulfur.  The nature of the porous carbon was not described, but cells constructed with these cathodes provided only a maximum of 50 cycles.  The decline in capacity with cycling was attributed to loss of  cathode active material.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,639,174 to Kegelman describes solid composite cathodes comprising elemental sulfur and a particulate electrical conductor.  U.S. Pat. No. 4,303,748 to Armand <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> discloses solid composite cathodes containing an ionically conductive material together with elemental sulfur, transition metal salts, or other cathode active materials for use with lithium or other anodes in which, for example, the active sulfur or other cathode active material and the inert compounds with electrical conduction, such as graphite powder, are both particles of between 1 and 500 microns in diameter.  Further examples of cathodes comprising elemental sulfur, an electrically conductive material and an ionically conductive material that operate in the temperature range from -40 &deg;C to 145&deg;C are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,523,179, 5,532,077, 5,582,623 and 5,686,201 to Chu.  U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,552,244 and 5,506,072 to Griffin <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> describe metal-sulfur batteries using a cathode comprising a mixture of finely divided sulfur and graphite packed around a conductive electrode and covered with a porous separator.  A minimum of 10 weight per cent of graphite is needed to achieve sufficient conductivity in the cathode structure.  No function other than providing conductivity is described for the graphite.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In spite of the many known systems, as for example described above, employing a solid cathode comprising elemental sulfur in rechargeable alkali metal sulfur battery systems has been problematic in obtaining good electrochemical efficiency and capacity, cycle life, and safety of the cells owing to the diffusion of sulfur active materials from the sulfur-containing cathode into the electrolyte and anode components.  This has been particularly true in battery cells comprising a sulfur-containing cathode in combination with a lithium-containing anode.  U.S. Pat. No. 3,907,591 to Lauck and an article by Yamin <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> in<highlight><italic> J. Power Sources</italic></highlight>, <highlight><italic>1983, </italic></highlight><highlight><italic>9</italic></highlight>, 281-287 describe the reduction of elemental sulfur during the discharging of a lithium/sulfur cell to soluble lithium polysulfides in high concentrations in the electrolyte.  Even partial reduction of the solid sulfur in the cathode forms polysulfides, such as lithium octasulfide, that are soluble in the organic electrolytes.  In battery cells, these soluble polysulfides diffuse from the cathode into the surrounding electrolyte and may react with the lithium anode leading to its fast depletion.  This leads to reduced capacity of the battery cell.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In attempts to reduce the problems associated with the generation of soluble polysulfides in alkali metal battery cells comprising elemental sulfur, battery cells have been developed utilizing cathodes comprised of sulfur-containing materials in which sulfur is chemically bound to an organic or carbon polymer backbone or to a low molecular weight organic compound.  One such class of electroactive sulfur-containing materials has been referred to as organo-sulfur materials.  Herein, the term &quot;organo-sulfur materials&quot; means a material containing organic sulfur compounds with only single or double carbon-sulfur bonds or sulfur-sulfur bonds forming disulfide (-S-S-) linkages.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,833,048 and 4,917,974 to Dejonghe <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> disclose liquid sulfur-containing cathodes comprising organo-sulfur materials of the formula, (R(S)<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, where y=1 to 6; R is one or more different aliphatic or aromatic organic moieties having 1 to 20 carbon atoms; and n is greater than 1.  U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,175 to Visco <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> describes the use of 1 to 20 weight percent of conductor particles, such as carbon black, in solid composite cathodes containing organo-sulfur materials having disulfide electroactive groups.  These organo-sulfur materials undergo polymerization (dimerization) and de-polymerization (disulfide cleavage) upon the formation and breaking of the disulfide bonds.  The de-polymerization which occurs during the discharging of the cell results in lower molecular weight polymeric and monomeric species, namely soluble anionic organic sulfides, which may dissolve into the electrolyte and cause self discharge, reduced capacity, and eventually complete cell failure, thereby severely reducing the utility of organo-sulfur materials as a cathode-active material in secondary batteries.  Although the soluble discharge products are typically soluble organic sulfides rather than the inorganic polysulfides of the type formed with elemental sulfur, the detrimental effects on electrochemical efficiency and cycle life are similar.  In addition, the organo-sulfur materials typically contain less than 50 weight per cent of sulfur so they have a much lower energy density or theoretical specific capacity than elemental sulfur.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,599 to Oyama <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> discloses a solid composite cathode comprising a combination of a compound having a disulfide group and a conductive polymer, or an organo-disulfide derivative of a conductive polymer.  In one variation, a complex is formed from a disulfide compound and a conductive polymer in a composite cathode layer so that the disulfide compound is not likely to leak out of the composite cathode into the electrolyte of the rechargeable battery.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a similar approach to overcome the dissolution problem with organo-sulfur materials, U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,598 to Visco <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> discloses solid composite cathodes comprising metal/organo-sulfur charge transfer materials with one or more metal-sulfur bonds, wherein the oxidation sate of the metal is changed in charging and discharging the positive electrode or cathode.  The metal ion provides high electrical conductivity to the cathode, although it significantly lowers the cathode energy density and capacity per unit weight of the polymeric organo-sulfur material.  There is no mention of retarding the transport of soluble reduced sulfide or thiolate anion species formed during charging or discharging of the cell.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another class of electroactive sulfur-containing materials comprises carbon-sulfur polymer materials, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,529,860, 5,601,947 and 5,609,702, and in copending U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 08/602,323 to Skotheim <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight>  These references also describe the use of conductive carbons and graphites, conductive polymers, and metal fibers, powders, and flakes as conductive fillers with carbon-sulfur polymer materials.  Herein, the term &quot;carbon-sulfur polymer materials&quot; means materials comprising carbon-sulfur polymers with carbon-sulfur single bonds and with sulfur-sulfur bonds comprising trisulfide (-S-S-S-), tetrasulfide (-S-S-S-S-), or higher polysulfide linkages.  The carbon-sulfur polymer materials comprise, in their oxidized state, a polysulfide moiety of the formula, -S<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>-, wherein m is an integer equal to 3 or greater.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Several approaches have been described to inhibit or retard the transport or diffusion of soluble polysulfides from the cathode to the electrolyte.  U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,369 to Dey <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> describes an ion exchange membrane between the cathode and the electrolyte/separator layer to inhibit the passage of polysulfides or other anions from the cathode into the electrolyte.  Without this barrier layer, the soluble polysulfides or other anions form insoluble films on the cathode and shorten the cycle life of the cell.  U.S. Pat. No. 3,532,543 to Nole <highlight><italic>et al.</italic></highlight> describes the attempt to use copper halide salts to limit the formation of polysulfides in a solid cathode containing elemental sulfur.  U.S. Pat. Application No. 08/859,996, titled &quot; Novel Composite Cathodes, Electrochemical Cells Comprising Novel Composite Cathodes, and Processes for Fabricating Same&quot; to the common assignee, discloses the addition of a class of electroactive transition metal chalcogenide materials to sulfur-containing cathodes to encapsulate or entrap the sulfur-containing materials to retard the transport of soluble polysulfides and sulfides from the cathode into the electrolyte.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Barrier layers, as for example those described heretofore, can be effective in preventing excessive diffusion of soluble cathode reduction products, such as inorganic polysulfides, into the electrolyte, thereby improving cycle life and safety from the levels obtained when excessive inorganic polysulfides and other soluble cathode reduction products are present in the electrolyte.  However, these barrier layers may have disadvantages.  Besides the cost and the non-cathode active volume occupied by the materials, they may effectively block the transport of desirable soluble or insoluble anionic species into the electrolyte.  Also, the barrier layer may be only partially effective so that there is a slow buildup of soluble cathode reduction products in the electrolyte.  While low concentrations of polysulfides initially may be acceptable in the early cycles of the cell, in the later charge-discharge cycles of the cell, the concentrations of the soluble polysulfides and other anions may become too high or excessive, thereby shortening the cycle life and decreasing cell safety.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Publication No. 09-147868, published June 6, 1997, describes the use of active carbon fibers to absorb electroactive sulfur-containing materials in cathodes of secondary batteries and to provide increased cycle life at high discharge currents.  These active carbon fibers are characterized by highly microporous structures with specific surface areas above 1000 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g, which absorb large amounts of sulfur-containing materials such as 30 to 50 weight per cent, into the pores.  These active carbon fibers also have diameters greater than 1 micron, typically in the range of 2 to 6 microns.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Despite the various approaches proposed for the fabrication of high energy density rechargeable cells comprising elemental sulfur, organo-sulfur or carbon-sulfur polymer materials in a solid cathode, there remains a need for materials and cell designs that prevent the excessive out-diffusion of sulfides and polysulfides from the cathode layers in these cells, improve the electrochemical utilization of cathode active materials and cell efficiencies, and provide safe rechargeable cells with high rates and capacities over many cycles.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention pertains to a solid composite cathode for use in an electric current producing cell comprising (a) an electroactive sulfur-containing cathode material, which material, in its oxidized state, comprises a polysulfide moiety of the formula, -S<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>-, wherein m is an integer from 3 to 10, and (b) a non-electroactive particulate material having a strong adsorption of soluble polysulfides, wherein the adsorption by said particulate material is characterized by adsorption of at least 40% of the lithium octasulfide in a 0.03 M solution of lithium octasulfide in tetraglyme with said particulate material present at the weight ratio of said particulate material to lithium octasulfide of 6.2 to 1.  The solid composite cathodes of the present invention are particularly preferred for use in electrolytic cells, rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, and the like, which comprise organic electroactive sulfur-containing cathodes and which require high energy density.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Non-Electroactive Particulate Material</italic></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The term &quot;particulate,&quot; as used herein, pertains to the non-fibrous shape and structure of the materials.  This particulate shape and structure may have a regular shape, as for example, spherical, or may have an irregular shape, but does not have a needle-like, fiber, or filament shape or structure.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The term &quot;electroactive,&quot; as used herein, pertains to the electrochemical property of a material which takes part in the electrochemical reaction of charge or discharge in an electric current producing cell.  The term &quot;non-electroactive,&quot; as used herein, pertains to the electrochemical property of a material which does not take part in the electrochemical reaction of charge or discharge in an electric current producing cell.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The term, &quot;adsorption,&quot; as used herein, pertains to the tendency of molecules or adsorbate from a liquid phase to adhere to the surface of a solid.  This tendency is an equilibrium-based selectivity among the different molecules in the liquid phase to compete, depending on their relative affinity for the surface of the solid, for physical adsorption, but not chemisorption, on this surface, as described in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th Edition, Vol. 1, pages 493-528, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991, Howe-Grant editor.  When the solid is microporous, this physical adsorption includes the amount of adsorbate on the surfaces of the solid and in the micropore volume of the solid.  The term, &quot;adsorbs,&quot; as used herein, pertains to undergoing the process of adsorption.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The relative ability of a non-electroactive material to retard the diffusion of electroactive materials from a solid cathode in an electric current producing cell may be evaluated by determining the efficiency with which the non-electroactive material physically adsorbs a soluble species of the electroactive material, when that soluble species is dissolved in a suitable solvent.  For example, when the electroactive material in the solid cathode is a sulfur-containing material, a typical soluble species is an inorganic polysulfide, such as lithium octasulfide, and a typical suitable solvent is an ether, such as tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether or tetraglyme.  One method for characterizing the efficiency of the non-electroactive particulate material in the practice of this invention is by adding a known amount of the non-electroactive particulate material to a solution of the dissolved species of the electroactive material in a solvent at the temperature desired, typically room temperature; allowing the non-electroactive material to adsorb the dissolved species until equilibrium is reached; separating the non-electroactive material from the solution; and measuring the amount of the dissolved species adsorbed by the nonmaterial and the amount remaining dissolved in the solvent.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The greater the percentage of  dissolved species that are adsorbed by the nonparticulate material, the stronger the adsorption of the dissolved or soluble species by the non-electroactive particulate material, and thus the more effective is the non-electroactive particulate material in retarding the out-diffusion and transport of these soluble electroactive materials from the cathode into the electrolyte and other parts of the electric current producing cell.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For the solid composite cathodes of the present invention comprising electroactive sulfur-containing materials, suitable non-electroactive particulate materials are those nonparticulate materials having a strong adsorption of soluble polysulfides.  To differentiate these non-electroactive particulate materials of the present invention from those non-electroactive particulate materials not having a strong adsorption of soluble polysulfides and thus not a part of the present invention, an adsorption test procedure was used to characterize the relative adsorptive strength or affinity for soluble polysulfides.  To characterize the capability of non-electroactive particulate materials to effectively retard the diffusion of polysulfides and related anionic reduction products of sulfur-containing cathodes from the cathode to other parts of the electric current producing cell, the adsorption affinity of the non-electroactive particulate material for these anionic reduction products was evaluated by a physical adsorption experiment using lithium octasulfide as a representative adsorbate for a polysulfide.  The more strongly the lithium octasulfide is adsorbed by the non-electroactive particulate material, the more effective the nonparticulate material will be in retarding the out-diffusion and transport of lithium octasulfide and related anionic reduction products to outside of the solid composite cathode.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For example, a  conductive carbon particulate material widely reported in experiments with sulfur-containing cathodes is SAB-50 (a tradename for Shawingan Acetylene Black, a conductive carbon pigment available from Chevron Corporation, Baytown, TX).  The physical adsorption experiment of mixing 0.5 g of SAB-50 carbon with a 10 ml solution of 0.03 M Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight> (lithium octasulfide) in tetraglyme, showed only a 14% adsorption of the lithium octasulfide.  86% of the lithium octasulfide remained in the tetraglyme solution.  Similarly, another conductive carbon particulate material used in sulfur-containing cathodes is VULCAN XE72R (a tradename for a carbon available from Cabot Corporation, Billerica, MA).  By the same physical adsorption test, the XE72R carbon only adsorbed 31% of the lithium octasulfide.  By contrast, three conductive carbon particulate materials of the present invention (PRINTEX XE; BLACK PEARL 2000, a tradename for carbon available from Cabot Corporation, Billerica, MA; and FW200, a tradename for carbon available from Degussa Corporation, Arkon, OH) showed adsorption of 50%, 65%, and 95%, respectively, of the lithium octasulfide using this same test procedure for physical adsorption.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The non-electroactive particulate materials of the solid composite cathodes of the present invention comprise those non-electroactive particulate materials having a strong adsorption of soluble polysulfides, wherein this strong adsorption by the particulate material is characterized by the adsorption of at least 40% of the lithium octasulfide in a 0.03 M solution of lithium octasulfide in tetraglyme with the particulate material present at the weight ratio of the particulate material to lithium octasulfide of 6.2 to 1.  In one embodiment, the adsorption by said particulate particle of the lithium octasulfide in said solution is at least 60%.  In one embodiment, the adsorption by said particulate material of the lithium octasulfide in said solution is at least 87%.  In one embodiment, the adsorption by said particulate material in said solution is at least 93%.  In one embodiment, the adsorption by said particulate material of the lithium octasulfide in said solution is at least 97%.</paragraph>

More particularly preferred particulate carbons of the present invention are those which adsorb at least 93% of the lithium octasulfide in a 0.03 M solution of the lithium octasulfide in tetraglyme with the carbon present at the weight ratio of the carbon to lithium octasulfide of 6.2 to 1, and include, but are not limited to, FW200.  Most particularly preferred particulate carbons of the present invention are those which adsorb at least 97% of the lithium octasulfide in a 0.03 M solution of the lithium octasulfide in tetraglyme with the carbon present at the weight ratio of the carbon to lithium octasulfide of 6.2 to 1.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The following general procedure was used to determine the relative adsorptive strength of various non-electroactive particulate materials for soluble lithium polysulfide solvates such as Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight> (lithium octasulfide).  The non-electroactive particulate material to be evaluated was dried under vacuum at 80 &deg;C for 18 hours.  To 10 ml of a 30 mM (0.03 M) solution of lithium octasulfide in dry tetraglyme at 25 &deg;C in an argon filled glove box was added 0.5 g of the non-electroactive particulate material.  This dispersion was stirred for 18 hours.  It was then transferred to a sealed centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 rpm under argon.  The supernatant liquid was filtered through a 0.45 micron syringe filter and analyzed by absorption spectroscopy using the absorbance band at 450 nm for lithium octasulfide.  The concentration of lithium octasulfide remaining in the solvent was then calculated using a calibration curve generated by using standardized solutions of lithium octasulfide in tetraglyme.  The amount of lithium octasulfide adsorbed by the non-electroactive particulate material was then calculated from the loss of lithium octasulfide from the solution.  Table I summarizes the adsorption strength of various carbons, silicas, and other particulate materials for lithium octasulfide.</paragraph>

Similar AA cells, except that either 10% SAB-50 carbon or 10% VULCAN XC72R carbon was substituted for the 10% PRINTEX XE-2, showed in both cases a volumetric capacity at the second discharge-charge cycle that was more than 10% lower than that of the AA cell with 10% PRINTEX XE-2 carbon and lost more than 15% of this volumetric capacity when cycled to 60 cycles.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Composite cathodes were fabricated from carbon-sulfur polymer (made by the process described in Example 2 in copending U.S. Pat. Application titled &quot;Electroactive, Energy-Storing, Highly Crosslinked, polysulfide-Containing Organic Polymers for use in Electrochemical Cells,&quot;filed on even day herewith by common assignee, now U.S. Pat.

The polymer was first pre-ground to disperse any clumping of polymer particles (typical mean size &lt;10 A cathode slurry was prepared with a formulation of 70% carbon-sulfur polymer, 10% conductive carbon pigment (PRINTEX XE-2), 5% non-activated PYROGRAF-III carbon nanofibers (a tradename for carbon nanofibers available from Applied Sciences, Inc., Cedarville, OH), 5% silica pigment (AEROSIL 380), and 10% polyethylene oxide (PEO with a molecular weight of 5,000,000 available from Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) by weight, in a mixed solvent of water and n-propanol (80:20 volume ratio) in a ball mill jar containing ceramic cylinders.  The solids content of the slurry was 12 wt%.  The mixture was ball milled for 20 hours.  The slurry was cast (hand drawn with a gap coater bar) onto both sides of a 17.5 micron thick conductive carbon coated aluminum foil (Product No. 60303, Rexam Graphics) as a current collector.  The coating was dried under ambient conditions overnight, and then under vacuum at 60&deg;C for one hour.  The resulting dry cathode coating had a thickness of about 20 to 25on each side of the current collector with a density or loading of carbon-sulfur polymer in the range of 0.63 to 0.97 mg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>.  The volumetric density of the carbon-sulfur polymer in the solid composite cathode layer was in the range of 319 to 385 mg/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Wound AA size cells were fabricated from these cathodes with a 75 micron lithium foil anode and a 25 micron E25 SETELA separator.  The cells were filled with a liquid electrolyte (50% 1,3-dioxolane, 20% diglyme, 10% sulfolane, and 20% dimethoxyethane by volume with 1.0 M lithium triflate salt).  The cells were cycled at a rate of charge and discharge of C/3 (0.2 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) and C/2 (0.33 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) respectively.  Cell performance data at 25 &deg;C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Figure 5</cross-reference>) showed that the carbon-sulfur polymer cathode had excellent capacity and good stability, with specific capacities of about 1000 mAh/g for the first 10and 700 mAh/g at the 100th cycle.  The cells showed a low rate of capacity loss with cycling with a value of about 0.29% per cycle.</paragraph>
