<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an online method and system for estimating the manufacturing cost of components and, more particularly, an online method and system of estimating piece cost, tooling cost, and finished weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cost estimation methods have been developed to provide cost estimates for the manufacture of automotive components, otherwise referred to as parts. An example of a process-based estimation method includes estimating piece cost and tooling cost based on a particular process step (i.e., grinding) defined for a component (i.e., brake pad). This method requires that a user understand all the process steps associated with the component in order to estimate costs associated with manufacturing the component. This detailed process information is typically known by a limited number of experts with extensive knowledge relating to the production of the component. Consequently, this method is only suitable for use by a very limited group of experts. Additionally, experts utilizing the process-based estimation method are required to run estimates on each process step, which can be quite cumbersome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to provide an online method and system for cost estimation which is component based and can estimate at least piece cost, tooling cost and/or finished weight. This method and system should not require in-depth knowledge of each process step involved in manufacturing a component in order to generate cost estimates. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The author can add quantitative driver information relating to the component models. In accord with a preferred embodiment, quantitative drivers refer to any numeric variable factor that can influence the component cost. For example, the quantitative drivers for a fuel tank strap can include, but are not limited to, strap length (in millimeters), strap width (in millimeters) and strap thickness (in millimeters). It should be understood that quantitative drivers can vary between models. It should also be understood that the unit of measure for the quantitative cost drivers can vary depending based on component and/or model, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accord with a preferred embodiment, an at least one GUI can be operably configured to receive quantitative driver information. The quantitative driver information can include descriptions, default values, minimum values, and maximum values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A default value can be established for each quantitative driver. The default value lies between a minimum and maximum possible value for the quantitative driver and is preferably set by the author. The default value can be used as a suggested normal value for the quantitative driver when an approximate measurement is unknown or unavailable. For example, the user can have a financial job function. This user may not know the approximate length of a fuel tank strap. Therefore, the user can use the default value and adjust later if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A specific model detail can be added for each component model applicable to the component. In accord with a preferred embodiment, the specific model detail can be unique for each component model and can include, but is not limited to, material number, purchased parts, material number for operations processes, and markup percentages. Preferably, a GUI can be operably configured to receive specific model detail information through a plurality of input data fields and data lists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With respect to the material number, the author can identify the raw material number used in a conventional material data listing for each component model. Specifically, a material and machine cost database (MMCD) can be utilized as the conventional material data listing. With a MMCD material number, the author can locate, among other pieces of information, the material description, cost per unit and unit designation. For example, the MMCD number for a fuel tank strap can be 200181. As derived from the MMCD number 200181, the raw material specification is CR-50XK CR HSLA 0.2832. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With respect to purchased parts, a description of the purchase parts associated with each component model can be generated, preferably by the author. For each purchased part identified, the quantity used, the price, and the weight can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For example, with respect to a fuel tank strap, a purchased part can be a support pin. Accordingly, the quantity can be one, the price can be $0.076, the material type can be steel, and the weight can be 0.02 kilograms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that some models may use only one purchased part or multiple units of the same purchased part. Consequently, default, minimum and maximum quantities for the purchased part can be determined. For example, some fuel tank straps may require only one support pin, while others may require five support pins. However, fuel tank straps normally require one support pin. Under these circumstances, the author can set the default quantity to one, the minimum quantity to one, and the maximum quantity to five. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With respect to material numbers for operations processes, a detailed description can be provided of the manufacturing process operations for each component model. For each operation of the process, the author can locate the machine description, machine code and cost per minute from the MMCD. Table 2 includes an example of the machine description, the MMCD machine code, the process description and the cycle time for a fuel tank strap.

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to Table 3, the length (L), width (W), thickness (T) and density (D) determines the material usage for the fuel tank strap. An extra 25.4 millimeters can be added to L and an extra 6.4 millimeters can be added to W to account for scrap. The material usage value can be multiplied by the price per unit to arrive at the cost of material used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A cycle time algorithm preferably considers the cycle time for each process applicable to the production of a component. As a first step, attributes, such as dimensions, affecting the cycle time for each process step are preferably identified. In the example depicted in table 4 below, Operation 1 can have a typical cycle time for the fuel tank strap with default measurements of 0.04 minutes. However, the thickness of the fuel tank strap may affect the cycle time of the stamping process. Therefore, the increase or decrease in the thickness greater than 1 millimeter (the default value) can cause the cycle time to likewise increase or decrease by increments of 0.01 minutes per millimeter. For example, if the thickness equals 1.5 mm, the cycle time can increase by 0.005 minutes.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The tooling cost algorithm preferably considers tooling material and tooling labor (build and design labor). Tooling material is preferably provided based on material type and material usage. Tooling labor is provided based on build and design labor hours. In determining values for tooling material and labor, the typical amount of tooling material needed is preferably computed. For example, according to Table 5, the typical amount of tooling material needed for a fuel tank strap is 16,700 pounds. However, the length of the fuel tank strap can affect the pounds of material needed to build the tool. For example, any length greater then or less than 800 millimeters can result in a proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of material needed at 15,000 pounds per millimeter. Thus, if the length is 1,000 millimeters, then the pounds of material needed would increase by 3,750 pounds.
