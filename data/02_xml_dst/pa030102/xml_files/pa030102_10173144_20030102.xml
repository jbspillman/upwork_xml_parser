<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The sampling rate of the optical and electrical signals provided by a DVD player according to standard IEC 61937 are converted in a first transcoder to the sampling rate of a multimedia network. The signals generated by the first transcoder with the sampling rate of the multimedia network are transmitted through a multimedia network line to a second transcoder, which based on the parameters contained in the signals received generates the signal originally generated by the DVD player and transmits it according to standard IEC 61937 to a DVD decoder. The technique is specifically suited for use in a motor vehicle and is distinguished by low technical complexity since without the transcoding by the two transcoders the encoded data stream at the output of the DVD player would have to be first decoded and then transmitted in multichannel mode as linear PCM data through a multimedia network line, for example, a MOST line. This approach, however, requires three to four times the bandwidth. In addition, the PCM data would have to be re-encoded for copyright reasons. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of signal transmission and decoding systems, and in particular to apparatus and method for transmitting data from a DVD player to a DVD decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> DVD players provide a digital output from which electrical or optical signals may be picked up. An audio decoder such as a Dolby Digital, DTS, MPEG, or MLP decoder may be connected to the output of a DVD player. Unencoded pulse code modulation (PCM) stereo audio data based on the IEC 60958 standard, or encoded multichannel audio data based on the IEC 61937 standard, is sent to the decoder from the digital output of a DVD player. In addition to the audio data, parameter settings (e.g., headers) for the decoder such as for example the sampling rate of the original data source may also be contained in the transmitted data stream. The data stream to be transmitted is biphase-coded and coupled to the sampling rate. The decoder (i.e., the data sink) is thus able to synchronize itself and reconstruct the original sampling rate of the data source, which for a DVD player, for example, is 48 KHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A Media Oriented System Transport or Media Oriented Synchronous Transfer (MOST) is a multimedia network developed for use in a motor vehicle. A fundamental feature of a MOST network is the fact that the applications layer is separate from the network layer. MOST networks also work on the basis of biphase-coded data. Data are typically transmitted at a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Additional information on MOST networks is disclosed in the publication entitled &ldquo;No Standard without Digitalization&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Automobil</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Entwicklung</italic></highlight>, May 2000, pages 88-90, and in the publication entitled &ldquo;Media Oriented System Transport (MOST), Standard for Multimedia Networking in Motor Vehicles&rdquo; <highlight><italic>VDI Berichte</italic></highlight>, no. 1415, 1998, pages 819-834. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A problem is that data from a data source such as a DVD player, has a first sample rate f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, that is not compatible with a multimedia transmission medium that employs a second sample rate f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and across which data is transmitted from the data source to a data sink, such as a DVD decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a technique for transmitting data from a data source such as a DVD player to a data sink such as a DVD decoder, via a multimedia network line, such as a MOST network, at a frequency that differs from that of the data from the data source. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Briefly, according to an aspect of the invention, a signal transmission and decoding system includes a data source that transmits first encoded data over a first transmission medium. A first transcoder receives the first encoded data via the first transmission medium, and transcodes the first encoded data to provide transcoded encoded data that is transmitted over a second transmission medium. A second transcoder that receives the transcoded encoded data via the second transmission medium, and transcodes the transcoded encoded data to provide second encoded data that is transmitted over a third transmission medium. A data sink that receives the second encoded data via the third transmission medium, and decodes the second encoded data to provide decoded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the data source includes a DVD player, the data sink includes a DVD decoder, and the second transmission medium comprises a MOST bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a method of transmitting data from a DVD player to a DVD decoder includes transmitting encoded data from the DVD player over a first transmission medium, and receiving the encoded data and transcoding the received encoded data to provide transcoded encoded data. The transcoded encoded data is transmitted over a second transmission medium, and then received and transcoded to provide received encoded DVD data. The received encoded DVD data is then transmitted over a third transmission medium to the DVD decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the signals of standard IEC 61937 supplied by the DVD player are transmitted to a first transcoder that analyzes the data stream received from the DVD player and determines the sampling rate. The first transcoder adjusts the sampling rate to that of the standard used by the multimedia network by changing the length of the pause packets contained in the data stream. If, for example, the sampling rate of the DVD player at 48 KHz is greater than the 44.1 KHz sampling rate required by the standard of the multimedia network, the first transcoder deletes a predetermined number of zeroes in the pause packets. To achieve this, for example, a phase-locked loop is provided in the first transcoder that converts the frequency of the biphase signal provided by the DVD player from 48 KHz to 44.1 KHz. The data stream generated by the first transcoder is transmitted through a multimedia network line to a second transcoder which, based on the parameters contained in the data stream received by the first transcoder, reproduces the data stream generated by the DVD player. In one embodiment, transmission of data from the DVD player to the first transcoder and from the second transcoder to the DVD decoder is performed according to standard IEC 61937. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a data stream based on standard IEC 61937, unassigned bits are present which, in one embodiment of the invention are used to provide control commands. The unassigned bits indicate, for example, how many zeroes must be deleted from the data stream or added to the data stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The FIGURE is a block diagram illustration of a signal transmission and decoding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a data source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that provides a signal on a line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a first transcoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The first transcoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides a signal on a line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (e.g., a multimedia network line such as a MOST bus) to a second transcoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which provides a signal on a line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a data sink <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention shall be discussed in the context of an embodiment wherein the data source is a DVD player, and the data sink is a DVD decoder. The DVD decoder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may, for example, be a Dolby Digital decoder, a dts decoder, an MPEG decoder, an MLP decoder, or another multichannel audio decoder. However, the invention is of course not limited to systems wherein the data source is a DVD player, and the data sink is a DVD decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The first transcoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives the signal on the line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and converts the sampling rate of the received signal to the sampling rate compatible with/required by the line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Depending on whether the sampling rate of the DVD player <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is greater than or less than the sampling rate for the transmission of data over the multimedia network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the first transcoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> removes zeroes from the pause packets or adds zeroes to them. Certain parameters are contained in the data stream that the first transcoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> transfers through the multimedia network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the second transcoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Using these parameters and the data received over the multimedia network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the second transcoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> recreates the signal originally transmitted by the DVD player <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second transcoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits the recreated signal to the DVD decoder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> over the line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be configured and arranged according to standard IEC 61937. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The signal transmission and decoding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be located in a motor vehicle. For example, the DVD player <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be connected, for example, through a MOST network to the DVD decoder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That is, the multimedia network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be configured and arranged for example as a MOST network. In one embodiment, the signal transmission and decoding system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be employed in a motor vehicle, such as an automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is distinguished from techniques wherein the encoded data stream is decoded at the data source (e.g., the DVD player), and then transmitted in multichannel mode as linear PCM data through for example a MOST network. However, this technique requires a bus bandwidth that is three to four times greater than the bus bandwidth required by the system of the present invention. In addition, the PCM data would have to be re-encoded once again for copyright reasons since decoded Dolby or dts data may not be transmitted in an open system. Therefore, when compared to known methods and systems, the present invention is distinguished by significantly less technical complexity despite the requirement of two transcoders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been shown and described with respect to several preferred embodiments thereof, various changes, omissions and additions to the form and detail thereof, may be made therein, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</paragraph>
