<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an air conditioner for a vehicle, and in particular to an air conditioner that minimizes temperature difference between mixed airs fed to different outlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Car air conditioning systems have been known for many years. A car air conditioning system is generally provided with a vent outlet, a defrost outlet and a foot outlet, which have to be supplied with not only solely warm air or solely cool air but also both warm air and cool air. When both warm air and cool air are fed to these outlets, these airs have to be mixed upstream of the outlets and then fed to the outlets as a mixed air, because if the warm air and the cool air are separately supplied to the outlets, the desired air temperature cannot be obtained at the outlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to meet this requirement, conventional car air conditioning systems utilize, for example, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, a car air conditioner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an air conditioner housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided at its upstream portion with an air intake <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into which ambient air and/or recirculated air from the car&apos;s passenger compartment is introduced. An evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the air intake <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided downstream of the evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and above the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A first pivoted valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for selectively directing cool air from the evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and/or the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided in a first passage defined between the evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A second pivoted opening/closing valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the first pivoted valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and for selectively directing mixed air composed of cool air from the evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and hot air from the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and/or the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A third pivoted opening/closing valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the second pivoted valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and for selectively directing the mixed air coming from the second pivoted valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.and/or a defrost outlet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided below second pivoted valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A fourth pivoted opening/closing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided for opening and closing the defrost outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In designing and producing cars, the manufacturer needs to provide the passenger(s) with as comfortable a cabin space as possible. In view of this need, the car air conditioning system is required to be downsized as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The air conditioning system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was designed to satisfy this requirement for compactification. Owing to the compactification, however, the air conditioning system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot provide sufficient mixing space for mixing the hot air heated by passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the cool air not passing therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the mixed air is supplied to, for example, the vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the air conditioning system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, most of the cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> flows into the vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> while most of the hot air from the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> flows into the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Consequently, these outlets cannot supply the mixed air at the desired temperature and the vehicle passenger(s) may feel uncomfortable due to the fact that there is a considerable difference between the temperature of the mixed air blown from the vent outlet <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and that of the mixed air from the foot outlet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an air conditioner for a vehicle capable of minimizing temperature difference between mixed airs to be fed to different outlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention achieves this object by providing an air conditioner for a vehicle comprising an air conditioner housing; an air intake formed in said air conditioner housing; an evaporator disposed downstream of said air intake; a heater core disposed downstream of said evaporator; vent and foot outlets formed in said housing downstream of said evaporator; a first passage defined between said evaporator and said heater core; a guide plate disposed downstream of said heater core for directing hot air heated by passing through said heater core toward cool air not passing through said heater core; means for conducting part of said hot air from said heater core guided by said guide plate to said vent outlet and/or for conducting part of said cool air not passing through said heater core to said foot outlet and a first distributing mechanism for opening and closing said vent outlet and for selectively directing mixed air composed of said cool air from said evaporator and said hot air from said heater core guided by said guide plate toward said vent outlet and/or said foot outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the air conditioner of the present invention, by means of the conducting means disposed in a space or area insufficient to mix hot air from a heater core and cool air not passing through the heater core, part of the hot air can be forcedly fed to a vent outlet to which a large amount of cool air tends to be fed, and part of the cool air can be forcedly fed to a foot outlet to which a large amount of hot air tends to be fed, thereby minimizing the temperature difference between the mixed airs fed to the respective outlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the conducting means preferably comprise a vertical duct member for directing a portion of the hot air from the heater core guided by the guide plate toward the vent outlet and a horizontal duct member for directing a portion of the cool air not passing through the heater core toward the foot outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the vertical duct member and the horizontal duct member preferably share at least one constituent wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings showing a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</paragraph>

A vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are provided downstream of the evaporator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and above the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A first distributing mechanism for selectively directing cool air from the evaporator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and/or the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided in a first passage <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> defined between the evaporator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the first distributing mechanism includes a first stopper plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> downwardly extending from a top wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (preferably upstream of the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>), a second stopper plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> upwardly extending from a bottom wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> between the evaporator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a first pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The first pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a proximal end portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A pivotably mounted on the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a free end portion or distal end portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B and is adapted to be pivoted around the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A so that the distal end portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B can be abutted against a lower end portion of the first stopper plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and an upper end portion of the second stopper plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, all of the first stopper plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the second stopper plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the first pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extend across the whole width of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for directing hot air heated by passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is defined between this guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> also extends across the whole width of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The air conditioning system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further comprises means for conducting or directing a portion of the hot air exiting from the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a portion of the cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this present embodiment, the conducting means is defined by conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> disposed at opposite lateral ends of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As can be better seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each of the conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> consists of a vertical duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A for directing a portion of the hot air exiting from the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and flowing through the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> toward the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a horizontal duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B for directing a portion of the cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The vertical duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A is a vertically extending duct box having upper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> open end portions. The lower open end portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> receives a portion of the hot air from the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the upper open end portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> delivers the hot air coming from the lower open end portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> toward the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The horizontal duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B is a horizontally extending duct box having rear <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and front <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> open end portions. The front open end portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> receives a portion of the cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the rear open end portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> delivers the cool air coming from the front open end portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> toward the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the conducting duct <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> disposed at the left side of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> right side wall of the vertical duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and a left side wall of the horizontal duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B are defined by the same plate member, thereby using the space in the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> more efficiently than a case where the vertical duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and the horizontal duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B are individually formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, each of the conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is fixed to the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by attachment of its rear end portion to the guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, attachment of its lower end portion to the heat core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and attachment of its front end portion to the first stopper plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Downstream of the first pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a second distributing mechanism constituted by a second pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is provided for opening and closing the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and for selectively directing mixed air composed of cool air from the evaporator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and hot air from the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> toward the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and/or the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The second pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a proximal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A pivotably attached to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a free end portion or distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B and is adapted to be pivoted around the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A so that the distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B can be abutted against the top wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When the distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B is abutted against the top wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the second pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is in its closed position in which the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is fully closed. On the other hand, when the distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B is abutted against the guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the second valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is in its open position in which the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is fully opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the second pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends across the whole width of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Downstream of the second pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a third distributing mechanism constituted by a third pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided for opening and closing the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and for selectively directing the mixed air coming from the second pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> toward the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and/or a defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> provided downstream of the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is provided with a fourth pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Each of the first through fourth valve plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is adapted to be driven, in a conventional way, to a predetermined position depending on one of various modes selected by an air conditioner control (not shown) disposed, for example, near the driver&apos;s seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The operation of the car air conditioning system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will now be described below taking as an example the mode in which mixed air composed of cool air and hot air is supplied from both the vent outlet and the foot outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When this mode is selected by the air conditioner control, the first pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pivoted around the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A so that the distal end portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B is positioned between the lower end portion of the first stopper plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion of the second stopper plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, to distribute the cool air from the evaporator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>/the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (hence, the conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) and the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The position to which the first pivoted valve plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pivoted differs depending on the temperature set by the air conditioner control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The second pivoted opening/closing valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pivoted around the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A so that the distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B is positioned between the top wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion of the guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, to distribute mixed air composed of hot air exiting from the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and passing through the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and cool air not passing therethrough to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. If it is desired to feed the same amount of the mixed air to each of the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the foot outlet (the defrost outlet), the distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B is positioned at the center between the top wall of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion of the guide plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. If it is desired to feed the different amount of the mixed air to the respective outlets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the distal end portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B of the second valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is displaced from said center position according to the amount the mixed air to be fed to the respective outlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Part of the mixed air distributed by the second valve plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> flows into the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the remainder thereof is directed to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the third valve plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> fully opening the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is prevented from flowing into the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> by the fourth valve plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> fully closing the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As in the conventional air conditioning system explained earlier, the present system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also lacks a mixing space sufficient for mixing hot air and cool air. However, the conducting means of the present system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> cause a portion of the hot air from the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be forcedly fed to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a portion of the cool air to be forcedly fed to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (toward the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>), thereby minimizing the temperature difference between the mixed airs fed to the respective outlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Specifically, due to the fact that part of the hot air from the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes through each vertical duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, i.e., enters at its lower open end portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and exits from its upper open end portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the parts of the hot air passing through the vertical duct members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A can be directed to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> without being affected by the cool air which did not pass through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, to be mixed with the cool air directed toward the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing the temperature of the mixed air fed to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, due to the fact that part of the cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes through each horizontal duct member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B, i.e., enters at its front open end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and exits from its rear open end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the parts of the cool air passing through the horizontal duct members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B can be directed to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (toward the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) without being affected by the hot air from the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to be mixed with the hot air directed toward the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>), thereby decreasing the temperature of the mixed air fed to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (toward the defrost outlet <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>). Thus, the passing of these airs through the duct members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B minimizes the temperature difference between the mixed air fed to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and that fed to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to a specific, preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications and improvements can be made while remaining within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The scope of the present invention is determined solely by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For example, although in the above embodiment the conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are disposed at the opposite lateral ends of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the positions of the ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are not limited to the lateral ends of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. That is, the conducting ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be disposed at any positions in the lateral direction of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the number of ducts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be only one or be three or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the conducting means may consist of only a vertical duct member(s) for conducting a portion of the hot air passing through the second passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the vent outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and may consist of only a horizontal duct member(s) for conducting a portion of the cool air not passing through the heater core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the foot outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The number of each of said vertical duct members and said horizontal duct members is not limited and each of these duct members may be disposed at any positions in the lateral direction of the housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
