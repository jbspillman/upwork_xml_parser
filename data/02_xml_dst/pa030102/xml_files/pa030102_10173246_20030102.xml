<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a laser diode drive circuit and an amplifying circuit for use in an optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus. More particularly, this invention relates to a current-to-voltage (I/V) converting circuit for use with a front monitor photodetector (FPD) and to a laser diode drive circuit using the above-mentioned current-to-voltage converting circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, a demand for an optical disc drive apparatus called &ldquo;super disc drive&rdquo; capable of reading and writing both a compact disc-recordable/rewritable (CD-R/RW) and a digital versatile disc (or digital video disc)-recordable/rewritable (DVD-R/RW) has been increasing on the market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The optical disc drive apparatus of this kind generally uses a power monitor circuit to detect light intensity of laser beams. This power monitor circuit includes a monitor diode to receive several percents (this numerical value changes depending upon design of optical system) of laser beams emitted from a laser diode (LD). In that case, when the power monitor circuit includes only one laser diode LD, a change in quantity of incident light due to a fluctuation of a divergent angle of the laser diode LD or due to a fluctuation of a beam splitter is within a range of approximately &plusmn;6 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the change in the quantity of incident light falls within the above-mentioned range, it is possible to adjust the conversion resistance value of the current-to-voltage converting circuit of the front monitor photodetector circuit in response to dispersion of individual operational amplifiers without sacrificing the performance such as an operation band, offset, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, let us consider now the electric power necessary for the two standards of the recordable/rewritable compact disc (CD-R/RW) and the recordable/rewritable digital versatile disc (DVD-R/RW). When speed at which data is to be recorded in the CD-R/RW is assumed to be 16 times as high as the normal speed, power (electric power) required by the laser diode LD becomes 160 mW expressed in the form of laser diode radiation electric power, and electric power required by the laser diode LD to record data in the DVD-R/RW becomes 70 mW expressed in the form of laser diode radiation electric power. Having compared two center values of the above-mentioned laser diode radiation electric power, it is to be understood that they have already differed from each other more than twice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, having considered dispersion of individual laser diodes LD in addition to the difference of the laser diode radiation electric power, a range greater than &plusmn;12 dB is required as the range in which a parameter of a circuit is to be adjusted. Therefore, when it is intended to secure such a wide range for adjusting a parameter of a circuit from a circuit design standpoint, it becomes impossible to maintain the performance of the laser diode LD, such as the offset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to realize the laser diode drive apparatus capable of reading and writing both the above-mentioned C-DR/RW and the above-mentioned DVD-R/RW, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there are required two high-output laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generating laser beams having wavelengths of 650 nm and 780 nm respectively. It is possible to realize functions necessary for the laser diode drive apparatus, even when an operational amplifier is configured in such a manner that the LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in separate optical systems. However, in this case it becomes unavoidable that the laser diode drive apparatus becomes large in size and becomes very expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a demand for an operational amplifier having as many components other than the laser diode LD in common as possible is increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings is a schematic circuit diagram in block form, which shows a laser diode drive circuit for use in an optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to the related art. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this related-art laser diode drive circuit is comprised of a laser diode drive circuit, a power monitor circuit and an automatic power control (APC) circuit, whereby the two laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generating the laser beams having the wavelengths of 650 nm and 780 nm can be controlled respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this APC circuit has a configuration of using elements and parts in common in the circuit necessary for the two laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and only electric power is switched over to be set. Similarly, a laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD can be provided with two output terminals used to switch-over an output and other portion (power monitor circuit) of the laser diode drive circuit can be used in common. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The power monitor circuit for the disc writing laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive and monitor several percents (this numerical value changes depending upon design of the optical system) of emitted power of laser beams from the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by a monitor diode PD. In that case, when the power monitor circuit includes only one laser diode LD, a change in quantity of incident light due to a fluctuation of a divergent angle of the laser diode LD or a fluctuation of a beam splitter is within a range of approximately &plusmn;6 dB. When the change in the quantity of incident light falls within the above-mentioned range, it is possible to adjust the conversion resistance value of the current-to-voltage converting circuit of the front monitor photodetector (FDP) circuit in response to dispersion of individual operational amplifiers without sacrificing the performance such as an operation band, offset, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, when electric power necessary for writing data in two standards of the CD-R/RW and the DVD-R/RW is considered, power (electric power) required by the laser diode LD necessary for the CD-R/RW becomes 160 mW and power required by the laser diode LD in the DVD-R/RW becomes 70 mW expressed in the form of laser diode radiation electric power at drive speed of the CD-R/RW being 16 times as high as the normal speed. Accordingly, two center values of the above-mentioned laser diode radiation electric power have already differed from each other more than twice. Further, having considered dispersion of individual laser diodes LD in addition to the fluctuations of the laser diode radiation electric power, a range greater than &plusmn;12 dB is required as the range in which a parameter of a circuit is to be adjusted. Thus, it becomes difficult to maintain the performance of the laser diode LD, such as the offset satisfactorily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the dynamic range of the optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus is doubly changed with respect to the CD-R/RW or the DVD-R/RW, then the available power margin is narrowed unavoidably. As a result, setting accuracy on the DVD-R/RW side where power should be set with high accuracy is doubly degraded, which is not preferable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A laser diode drive circuit and an amplifying circuit for use in an optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an example of an optical disc recording and/or reproducing (write and/or read) apparatus according to the present invention. According to this optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, information may be recorded on the optical disc and/or reproduced from the optical disc, as briefly described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when information is recorded on the optical disc in this optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, a control signal and write data transmitted from an interface are supplied to an encoder. Data encoded by the encoder is supplied to an APC circuit to be controlled in power. Then, the data processed by the APC circuit is supplied to an optical pickup (OP), in which the processed data is optically modulated and is then properly focused on a rotating optical disc, thereby being recorded on the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Also, when information is reproduced from the optical disc in this optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, information recorded on the optical disc is reflected in the reflected light that has been irradiated on the optical disc by a laser diode (LD). This reflected light is supplied to a photodetector (PDIC) which photoelectrically converts the reflected light to provide an RF signal. This RF signal is supplied to a signal processing circuit to extract a servo signal and a read data signal. The read data signal is supplied to a decoder to be decoded and the decoded read data signal is transmitted to the outside through an interface under control of a controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In this optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, the laser diode (LD) in the optical pickup (OP) is switched-over depending upon the type of optical disc, and light emitted from the working laser diode (LD) is irradiated on the optical disc through a combined prism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Part of light emitted from the laser diode (LD) is fed through a semiconductor chip (FPD-IC) of a front monitor photodiode (FPD) back to the APC circuit, where it is used for a variety of control operations. These control operations will be described below in association with a laser diode drive circuit (LDD) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in which case the FPD-IC (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is represented as a photodetector PD (photodetectors PD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a laser diode drive circuit for use in an optical disc recording and/or reproducing (write and/or read) apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there are provided laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adapted to generate laser beams for recording and/or reproducing. These laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are driven by power supplied from a laser diode drive power source circuit LDD. An output from this laser diode drive circuit LDD is switched over by a switch SW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and supplied to either the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Let it now be assumed that the switch SW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the contact illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being driven and data is being written in the disc with laser beams emitted from the laser diode. Then, part of the emitted laser beams is received by a photodiode PD and that is introduced into an operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the contact of a switch SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, where an output current of the photodiode PD is converted into a voltage. An output from the operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied through the illustrated contact of a switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to an inverting input terminal of a comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in an APC (auto power control) circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A reference voltage source REF is connected to a non-inverting input terminal of the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> compares the signal supplied to the inverting input terminal with the reference voltage supplied to the non-inverting input terminal. A detected error signal is supplied from the output terminal of the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD. Although there is illustrated only one reference voltage source REF in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in actual practice, there are provided different reference voltage values the number of which corresponds to the number of power levels of laser beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Part of laser beams emitted from the laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is obtained by a suitable means and led to the above-mentioned detection photodiode PD. However this process is not directly related to the present invention and therefore need not be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled by a signal received at the photodiode PD and then supplied through the switch SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the amplifier A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> back to the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD in such a manner that the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD may be driven at constant output power. Specifically, if it is determined that there is no error signal by comparing the voltage of the feedback signal and the reference voltage in the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the output of the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD is not changed at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As intensity of light emitted from the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases, the intensity of the signal detected by the photodiode PD also increases so that the intensity of the signal fed back to the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> also increases. Therefore, a negative feedback signal is supplied from the comparing operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD in order to decrease intensity of the output of the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD. Also, when intensity of light emitted from the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> decreases, intensity of the output from the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is increased by the laser diode drive power supply circuit LDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the case where the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled has been described so far, the present invention is not limited thereto and the laser diode LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be controlled similarly as described above. Specifically, the contact positions of the switches SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be changed-over to the opposite sides and control operations similar to those of the above-mentioned case may be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although only one APC circuit is illustrated in the circuit arrangement in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in order to make the present invention clearly understandable, in actual practice, there are provided a plurality of APC circuits, the number of which corresponds to the number of power levels of laser beams. These APC circuits are connected in parallel, and upon use, a required APC circuit is connected to the drive circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Although output voltages of the current-to-voltage conversion amplifiers A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the output of the photodiode PD can be adjusted by variable resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the ranges adjusted by these variable resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the laser diodes LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, LD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and other circuit elements are used and driven by change-over switches, the operation range is unavoidably widened, and hence it becomes difficult for only one amplifier to control all the driving of these circuit elements. Moreover, when one amplifier is used in common for all the driving of these circuit elements, the operation characteristics of the current-to-voltage conversion amplifier cannot be maintained satisfactorily. </paragraph>
