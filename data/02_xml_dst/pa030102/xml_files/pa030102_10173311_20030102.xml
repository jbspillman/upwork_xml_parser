<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the problems and disadvantages, the invention provides a digital camera including a function unit operable upon storage of the digital image, a memory that stores the status of the function unit upon every storage of the digital image, and an output of the contents of the memory to the outside of the digital camera. The memory of status is kept without deletion to be a history of the status of the function unit. Further, the user is forbidden to use the output, but the output is to be used when the digital camera is returned for a recycle </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the feature of the present invention above, the contents of the memory taken out of the digital camera through the output can be well utilized. In other words, the contents of the memory is transferred to a database, or to a site of designing digital cameras. The transferred contents of the memory and the statistics or analysis thereof would be a valuable feedback in planning the design, production and recycle of the future model of digital cameras. Examples of the function unit operable upon storage of the digital image are an electronic flash unit and a zooming unit, or the like. Further, examples of the status of the function unit to be stored is a value with which the function unit operates, or information representing whether or not the function unit operates upon the storage of the digital image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the feature of the present invention above, since a digital camera user cannot take out the contents of the memory of the digital camera, any confusion in use of the digital camera can be prevented. In order for a user of the digital camera not to use the output, the output is of a special shape different from a standard shape in common uses. Alternatively, the output may be on a special protocol different from a standard protocol in common uses, or the output may be covered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a detailed feature of the present invention, the memory of status is kept within the digital camera even if the storage of digital image is removed from the digital camera. Thus, the status of the function unit upon the storage of the digital image is safely kept without deletion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, a digital camera includes a sensor of an environment of the digital camera, a memory that stores the output of the sensor upon every storage of the digital image caused by a release member, and an output of the contents of the memory. Examples of the environment sensor include a thermometer, a hygrometer, a barometer, a noise meter and a global positioning. Thus, the history of the environment of the digital camera is stored upon its usage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to still another feature of the present invention, a digital camera includes a memory that stores the time when the release member causes the storage of the digital image upon every storage of the digital image, and an output of the contents of the memory to the outside of the digital camera. The user is forbidden to use the output. Accordingly, the history relating to time such as frequency in use of the digital camera can be stored without confusion in uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to a further feature of the present invention, a digital camera includes a memory that stores the history of delivery of the digital camera, and an output of the contents of the memory to the outside of the digital camera. The user is forbidden to use the output. Accordingly, the history of delivery of the digital camera from its shipment to the return can be stored without confusion in uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, a digital camera includes a first memory that stores data relating to the usage of the digital camera, an output of the contents of the first memory to the outside of the digital camera, and a second memory that stores an authorization by the user to use the output. When the authorization to use the output is not stored in the second memory, the contents of the first memory is not taken out from the returned digital camera. Accordingly, the contents of the memory can be taken out from the collected digital camera without causing a trouble with the user such as invasion of privacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to still another feature of the present invention, a digital camera includes a first member to cause a first function relating to storage of a digital image, a second member to cause a second function incapable of being caused by the first member, a memory that stores information of the second function in response to the second member, and an output of the contents of the memory to the outside of the digital camera. The memory of the information is kept without deletion to be a history of the second function. Accordingly, the history of the operation other than the storage of the digital image such as a playback of the stored digital image can be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to a further feature of the present invention, a recycle method of a digital camera having a memory for storing data other than digital image is provided. The method includes the steps of receiving the digital camera returned from a user, confirming an authorization by the user to take out the contents of the memory, taking out the contents of the memory on the confirmation of authorization, and putting the returned digital camera to a recycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> More specifically, examples of the data in the memory include a history of the usage of the digital camera, and a history of the delivery of the digital camera. The confirming step includes a step of taking a sign of the authorization out of the returned digital camera for example. Alternatively the confirming step may include a step of directly asking the user for the authorization. An example of the putting step includes a step of transferring the returned digital camera to a site of recycling digital cameras. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the recycle method described above, the contents of the memory can be taken out from the returned digital camera without causing a trouble with the user such as invasion of privacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to a detailed feature of the invention, the recycle method further includes a step of transferring the taken-out contents of the memory to a database, or a step of transferring the taken-out contents of the memory to a site of designing digital cameras. Thus, the contents of the memory of the returned digital camera is effectively utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the method above, another example of the data other than digital image to be stored in the memory is the data peculiar to the user of the returned digital camera. An example of such data is the customer information including one or combination of name, address, custom settings, user contract, and password. According to a detailed feature of the invention, the method further includes a step of transferring the taken-out data peculiar to the user to a new digital camera gotten or to be gotten by the same user. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a rental system according to a first embodiment of the present invention in which digital cameras are distributed as rental commodities. A number of rental centers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are dispersedly arranged in a corner of a numbers of shops such as rental video shops and convenience stores, in which customers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> directly visit nearby rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for borrowing or returning digital cameras. In returning a digital camera, you are not necessary to bring it to the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> where the digital camera was borrowed, you can bring it any rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the rental system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described later, image information recorded in the digital camera is read out by the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the digital camera is returned. The read out image information is returned to the customer as requested in the form of printed image by a printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A such as a silver halide printer. The customer may request in the form of a CD-R on which the read out image information is recorded. In this case, a CD-R on which the image information is recorded by a CD-R driver <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B is delivered to the customer. The arrow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes a delivery route whereby digital cameras and recorded media such as print and CD-R are delivered to customers over the counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Moreover, with the consensus of the customer, the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reads out the using condition of the camera at the time of returning the digital camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected with a plurality of rental centers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by means of communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Although database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may usually be one in a single rental system, the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be divided into more than one according to circumstances. Communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is the Internet or a dedicated circuit in the rental system. On the basis of information from the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A records information of a new customer such as name, address, phone number, mail address, and credit card number, and issues customer ID number. In the case of a new customer, private information such as age, sex, etc. is recorded on customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A with the consensus of the customer. The private information is strictly controlled by a contract with the customer. Moreover, customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A records and controls information regarding borrowing, returning and using of each commodity to carry out statistic information processing of each commodity on the basis of the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is possible for the customer to ask rental system to keep the read out image information. In this case, image information is transmitted to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be stored in the image database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. In accordance with a future request of the customer, the stored image is transmitted to rental center to deliver the customer prints or CD-R as required. Moreover, it is possible for a customer to access directly to database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through a personal computer to take a view of the stored image of the customer and to ask to produce its print. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a distribution route <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to make an exchange of digital cameras. Although the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may usually be one in a single rental system, the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be divided into more than one according to circumstances. Distribution route <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> makes it possible to exchange digital cameras within a plurality of rental centers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to have a proper assortment of digital cameras in each rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to provide new models to each rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Distribution center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>exchanges digital cameras within rental centers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and has a function of inventory control. Existence of the distribution center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes it possible that a customer can return a digital camera to any rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> different from where the digital camera was borrowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Digital cameras returned to each rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are sent to the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the distribution route <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, digital cameras are cleaned, exchanged battery and parts, and repaired broken portion in a recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, and returned to the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the distribution center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the distribution route <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In order to control these exchanges of digital cameras, each rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected with a communication network <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. By the way, instead of returning all cameras returned to the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the logistics center, only those that need to be repaired in the recycle center may be sent to the logistics center after carrying out preliminary check in the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this way, digital cameras which have no problems to rent out again can be immediately stored in warehouse for providing another rental. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal center (hereinafter called &ldquo;general center&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> takes charge of general function including ordinary research and development, manufacturing as well as disposal. Although the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may usually be one in a single rental system, the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be divided into more than one according to circumstances. Moreover, a plurality of functions of a general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be divided into a plurality of centers locating in different locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected with the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by a communication network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to receive statistical information of commercial distribution regarding mainly the customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. Commercial distribution information is, first of all, used for production adjustment in the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> such that digital cameras increasing frequency in rental are increased production, or those loosing in popularity are decreased/discontinued production. Since commercial distribution information includes information regarding personal information as well as purpose of using a digital camera, these information as well as variation in quantity of distribution can be reflected in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a next model. In the case of rental comparison with ordinary sale, since marketing information can be obtained perfectly in real time, the response to product planning becomes dramatically fast. In addition, the response from the market can be obtained extremely fast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected with the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by a distribution route <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Through the distribution route <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, newly manufactured digital cameras are delivered to the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and digital cameras unable to repair or increasing stock because of loosing in popularity are returned from the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for the purpose of disposal. In order to control the distribution of digital cameras, the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected by a communication network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Through the communication network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, individual information as well as statistical information regarding cleaning, parts exchange, repair, etc. in the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A are transmitted to the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the information from the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A are also reflected in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a next model. Moreover, information regarding cost down of recycle process obtained in the work record in the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A is transmitted to the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through the communication network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be reflected in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a next model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the rental system described above, digital cameras are not disposed in the customer&apos;s level. Since disposal function of the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is included in the product circulation, no digital camera is come out from the rental system as a reject, so that zero-emission for the global environment can be accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in detail according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> portion relevant to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is denoted by the common reference number. Customer&apos;s terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is secured enough numbers such that the customers visiting the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are not necessary to wait. New customer inputs customer control information such as name, address, telephone number, mail address, credit card number, etc. by using any one of vacant customer&apos;s terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with the help of the display. Privacy information such as age, sex, etc. is also input with the consensus of the customer. When providing private information, the customer is awarded the privilege of receiving a small token as well as information regarding coming new product and new service suitable for the private information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The information is transmitted to a host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through a LAN <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> communicates with the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and issues a customer ID number on the basis of the communication. The customer can receive a customer card formed on the basis of the customer control information and the customer ID number from the customer&apos;s terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. By the way, instead of visiting the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, customer can receive the customer card through home delivery by accessing to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> directly from a customer&apos;s personal computer through the Internet and filling in predetermined items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The customer necessary for renting a digital camera makes the customer&apos;s terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> read the customer card to designate the camera and inputs rental conditions such as rental period, etc. The input data is transmitted to the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. On completion of acceptance of the rental, the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> makes the customer&apos;s terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> issue an exchange ticket as well as makes a warehouse <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> send the designated digital camera to a delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through a delivery means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The customer can receive the digital camera at the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by showing the exchange ticket. In order for the customer to be able to return the digital camera to any rental center, the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> transmits the customer&apos;s rental data to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Various kinds of digital cameras are prepared in a camera trial corner <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A customer can use these digital cameras by way of trial in the camera trial corner <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> prior to designate the camera. In addition, an interactive terminal is arranged for guiding in accordance with items how to use a digital camera for a customer not familiar to digital cameras. On the display of the terminal, an image of the digital camera that the customer is going to use by way of trial is shown, so that the customer touches an operating portion of the digital camera shown on the display where the customer does not know how to use in comparison with the digital camera actually holding in the hand. Accordingly, the request for explanation regarding the operating portion is accepted, so that the customer receives the explanation how to use the operating portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The using data of digital cameras by way of trial and the using data of the usage guidance in accordance with items are monitored by the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the information is transmitted to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be recorded in the customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. These customer information and its statistic information are sent from the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to be reflected in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a future model. For example, an operating portion receiving a lot of request for usage guidance is improved in a user-friendly manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A customer visiting a rental center after finished shooting makes a customer terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> read-in the customer card and inputs that the camera is brought back. When the customer only input that the camera is brought back, it means default order that all image data in the camera are to be printed and stored in the image database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. In the case of silver halide film, this corresponds to the order of development and prints at the same time and to preparing for additional order of prints. When a customer places a different order, the customer inputs a desired image order in accordance with the guidance of the customer terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. After this procedure, the customer returns the digital camera to the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A delivery means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> delivers the digital camera from the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to a data readout terminal <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> whereby shot image data and information of the camera usage are readout. The readout image data and the information of the camera usage are sent to a local server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Instead of above-described embodiment, it is also possible that the digital camera is constructed to be able to receive an image order with memorizing the data input from the customer terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the occasion of rental. In the type of embodiment, on returning the digital camera, the customer may just return the camera to the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> not necessary to make the customer terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> readout the customer card or to input return data and image order data. In this case, the data readout terminal <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> reads out shot image data, information of camera usage, return data, and image order data to send the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> After completion of readout, the digital camera is delivered to the warehouse <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by a delivery means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As described above, the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected with the distribution route <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that returned digital cameras are delivered from the warehouse <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and digital cameras to be rented are delivered from the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the warehouse <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the instruction of &ldquo;print&rdquo; is included in the image order data, the image data is sent from the local server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A to print, and the print is delivered to the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through a delivery means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The customer can receive prints when returning the digital camera. On the other hand, when the instruction of &ldquo;writing on a CD-R&rdquo; is included in the image order data, the image data is sent from the local server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the CD-R driver <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, and the CD-R on which the image data is written is delivered to the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through a delivery means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Moreover, when the instruction of &ldquo;keeping of the shot image data&rdquo; is included in the image order data, the image data stored in the local server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be stored in the image database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. The information of camera usage stored in the local server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the communication network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be stored in the customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B regardless of the order cases. On this occasion, the information of data order is also transmitted to the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as statistic information to be stored in the customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be concentrated in one location. In this case, delivery means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are not necessary, so the delivery from the data readout terminal <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the warehouse <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is carried out manually by a clerk. If the operation of terminals such as the customer terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the terminal in the camera trial corner is carried out by clerks, all procedure can be completed by the communication between the customer and the clerk on the delivery corner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing commercial commodity providing system according to a second embodiment of the present invention, in which a digital camera as a commercial commodity is circulated by using an existing convenience store system. A rental system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Since the detail of these construction is in common with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the illustration using block diagram in each center and the explanation of the function in the rental system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are abbreviated. In addition, since the detail of the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in common with that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the illustration and explanation of the system except the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are abbreviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In a convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a second store <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are connected with a distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> by a route <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a route <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively, so as to be delivered commercial commodities. Although only two stores are shown for the simplicity, a lot of stores exist actually. The distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> acts as a hub of distribution in the convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and is connected with the a stock center <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> through a distribution route <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so as to receive stock to be supplied to the stores and to return commodities according to circumstances. In commodities right out of the factory, commodities from a manufacturing center <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are delivered to the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> through a distribution route <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Customer can purchase a commodity visiting nearby store such as the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the second store <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or placing an order through telephone or communication system to receive at home <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by home delivery through distribution route <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The distribution control and the payment settlement are controlled in centralized manner by a system computer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In each block, not shown, such as the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the convenience store system, a local computer is arranged to exchange data for delivery and payment settlement with the system computer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the rental system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected with the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> by a distribution route <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> communicate with the system computer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by a communication network <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> acting as a window of the rental system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to carry out delivery control and payment settlement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> At first, renting out a digital camera employing the convenience store system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is explained. The digital camera ready to rent out is delivered from the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> through the distribution route <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> just same as other commodities in the convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and is further delivered to the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, etc. by the distribution route <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In this case, the convenient store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> accepts claim of a &ldquo;cost price&rdquo; from the rental system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> just same as ordinary purchase. The convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> displays the digital camera at the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, etc. at a &ldquo;sales price&rdquo; added a margin to the &ldquo;cost price&rdquo;. For a customer, this &ldquo;sales price&rdquo; means the rental cost of the digital camera and the cost for prints. Although the rental and charge system is described later in detail, the system according to the second embodiment is similar to the distribution system of a &ldquo;disposable camera&rdquo; such that you obtain a camera, &ldquo;return&rdquo; it to a lab after finished shooting, and receive only images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A customer requesting for renting out a digital camera visits, for example, the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, brings a digital camera from a display in the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to a cashier similar to ordinary commodities, and pay the &ldquo;sales price&rdquo;. At that time, information in the customer card in the rental system, a digital camera number, the date, etc. are input to the local computer in the cashier of the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to inform to the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the system computer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this case, when the payment is carried out by using an IC card issued from the convenience store system, the information can be input easily and the &ldquo;renting out&rdquo; is completed with just the same labor for paying a bill of the other ordinary commodities in the convenience store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> By the way, a customer may receive a digital camera by delivery to the home <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> using the distribution route <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> without visiting the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The customer finished shooting returns the digital camera to the cashier of the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> or the like. The cashier of the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> inputs necessary information such as a digital camera number, image order data, the way to receive prints and sends the received digital camera to the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> through the distribution routes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The information input into the local computer of the cashier of the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the system computer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this case also, when the customer provides the IC card, the necessary information can be input easily. In addition, when the image order data and the way to receive prints can be input in the digital camera, the labor to input information at the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> when returning the digital camera is alleviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> By the way, the customer may return the digital camera to the second store <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> not limiting to the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> where the digital camera was rented out. Moreover, the customer can return the digital camera from the home <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by using the distribution route <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it is needless to say that the customer may directly return the digital camera to the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the rental center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When the image order of a customer is not only the keeping of the shot image data, the rental system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> records the image data in the form of print or CD-R according to the order to prepare providing at the delivery corner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The prints or the CD-R is delivered to the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> through the distribution route <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, then to the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the second store <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, or the home <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in accordance with the customer&apos;s instruction. In the case of delivering to a store, the prints or the CD-R is kept in the store until the customer visit to receive it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the procedure of the local computer in the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the like according to the second embodiment. The local computer deals with the rent-out control and accounting of the digital camera rental system as well as accounting procedure of ordinary commodities. In this embodiment, it is explained such case as an example that the billing and payment are carried out by the IC card issued to the customer registered to the convenience store system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When a customer brings a digital camera with other ordinary commodities to the cashier and a provided IC card is inserted in the slot of the cashier, the flow starts from the step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, information in the IC card is input to the local computer and the customer is identified. In step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, information stored in the barcode attached to each commodity brought to the cashier is readout one after another by a barcode reader. In step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the commodity is identified by the information readout by the barcode reader and checked whether the commodity is a digital camera or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, when the commodity is not a digital camera, it is ordinary commodity. Accordingly, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for inputting the price of the commodity. In step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whether the input of all commodities has been completed or not is asked. When the incompletion is input within a predetermined time, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for reading out information of the next commodity. When the commodity is an ordinary commodity, the above-described steps are repeated. When the completion is input in step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, or when a predetermined time period has passed without any input, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, each price is added up and the total amount is charged. The charge information is input to the IC card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, when the commodity is a digital camera, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including communication with the customer shown as below. By the way, when the commodity is a digital camera, the information such as the ID number of the digital camera, the maximum frame number to be able to shoot, etc. has been automatically input from the barcode information readout in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the input date is automatically input as a rent-out date and the prearranged restoration date is input based on the customer&apos;s request. Unless otherwise specific request from the customer, the date of one week after the rent-out date is automatically input as a default value of the item. In step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the estimated frame number to shoot is input on the basis of the customer&apos;s request. Unless otherwise specific request from the customer, the maximum frame number to be able to shoot readout from the barcode information is also automatically input as a default value of the item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the date information input in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the customer information input in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the ID number of the digital camera input in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are output from the local computer as rent-out control information to be transmitted to the host computer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the system computer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, when the commodity is a digital camera, the charge is automatically calculated and input in accordance with the ID number of the digital camera, the rent-out date, the prearranged restoration date, and the estimated frame number to shoot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> By the way, the order of process from step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not limited to the order shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and may be changed in a suitable order. Moreover, in the case of an embodiment that the rent-out condition of a digital camera is set uniformly and the required information such as the charge is input as a fixed value readout from the barcode information, the steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are automatically processed without hearing customer&apos;s request. The above-described barcode may be printed on the face of the digital camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment for obtaining good flow at the cashier by eliminating the question to the customer in steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be considered as described below. Although the kind of the digital camera is the same, digital cameras are displayed on the convenience store as a plurality of commodities having different barcode on the package of the digital camera according to the rent-out condition such as rent-out terms and the frame number to be able to shoot. For example, one commodity shown in the display is attached a price of 1500 yen for tree days of the rent-out term and 25 frames of the frame number to be able to shoot, and another one is 2600 yen for one week and 50 frames. In this embodiment, although various &ldquo;assortment&rdquo; is required in accordance with the diversified customer&apos;s demand, when the customer just selects a desired &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; and brings it to the cashier, the required information in steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be automatically input in an instant by reading out the barcode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As described above, the rent-out control and accounting in the digital camera rental system is carried out in the flow of the cashier in the convenience store system using an IC card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the system can identify a customer by using a credit card other than an IC card, the rent-out control and accounting in the digital camera rental system can be carried out in the accounting flow of the above-described convenience store system. In this case, step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes a process for drawing the price from a bank account, etc. of a customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a table showing an example of a charge system for a digital camera rental system. As shown in the column &ldquo;designate term of days&rdquo; in the section &ldquo;rental fee&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, although the rental fee is basically 200 yen per day, there are discount courses such as 500 yen for 3 days and 2 nights, 1100 yen for a week (8 days, until the same day of the next week), and 3500 yen for a month (until the same day of the next month). The longer the term, the cheaper the fee. By the way, once the course is determined, you cannot change after that. The fee for the excess date from the course is 200 yen per day for all courses. The fee for keeping data is free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Usually, the fee at the time of rent-out is charged in accordance with the course designated by the customer. However, it is possible for an embodiment that the charge for one month course is uniformly applied at the time of rent-out as a deposit for the rental, and at the time of return the most favorable course for the customer is applied, so that the difference is returned to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Although print fee is basically 50 yen per sheet, you have to order at least 5 sheets, so that the minimum print fee is 250 yen. In addition, there are a 25-sheet course that 1000 yen for 25 sheets, and a 50-sheet course that 1500 yen for 50 sheets. When you select these courses, a digital camera equipped with a memory having a capacity larger than respective capacity is rent out. The above-described courses correspond to a 25 frames shot and a 50 frames shot respectively when the film is ordered for development and print at the same time in the silver halide film camera. However, in the digital camera, it is not necessary to shoot all capacity, so, in the 25-sheet course, at least 15 sheets may be ordered for print. Accordingly, unnecessary print fee is adjusted by 40 yen per sheet. As a result, the minimum charge for the 25-sheet course is 600 yen. In other words, the 25-sheet course is a course that prints from 15 sheets up to the number of sheets corresponding to the full capacity by the rate of 40 yen per sheet. Likewise, in the 50-sheet course, when the minimum sheet number of 30 sheets print is ordered, the course allows to print by 30 yen per sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When you order recording on a CD-R, a basic fee including 5 images recording is 1000 yen; 6 images and over costs 20 yen per each image as an excess fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It happens often that an adjust amount in the print fee and an excess amount in the CD-R recording are not clear at the time of rent-out, so each basic fee is charged to the IC card of the customer at the time of rent-out, and the difference is adjusted including excess term charge in the rental fee at the time of return. For example, when a customer uses a 50-sheet course for the term of 1 week, the total fee 2600 yen is charged at the time of rent-out. When the customer returns the digital camera with a 35-sheets-print order without excess term, the print fee of 450 yen for 15 sheets is paid back to the IC card of the customer. For another example, when a customer uses a 25-sheet course for the term of 3 days, the total fee 1500 yen is charged at the time of rent-out. When the customer returns the digital camera with a 20-sheets-print order with excess term of 2 days, the excess fee charge of 400 yen and the print fee of 200 yen repayment for 5 sheets result in additional charge of 200 yen to the customer&apos;s IC card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The lower portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows several cases of charges based on the charge system. The first example is a case that a customer returns the same day with the designated number of print. In this case, 200 yen of the 1 day rental fee and 250 yen of the minimum print number of 5 sheets make 450 yen of the minimum rental fee. The fourth example is a case of the 3 days rental and a 25-sheets-print course, so 500 yen of the rental fee and 1000 yen of the print fee make 1500 yen of the total charge. In this case, the number of print can be adjusted such as the minimum number of 15 sheets. Accordingly, the print fee becomes 600 yen, so that the minimum fee becomes 1100 yen. The other examples can be understood likewise, so that the explanation is abbreviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Although a limit is applied to the rental term in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> rental fee system may be possible as another embodiment that the rental term is unlimited by paying a predetermined amount of fee, and using within the warranty period of battery at customer&apos;s responsibility. The manner of return in the embodiment becomes similar to that in the disposable camera in the silver halide photography. Although the disposable camera is not a rental commodity but a commodity to be purchased, when it is returned to a lab after shooting, it does not remain in user&apos;s hand but is recycled to be sold again as a commodity, so that it actually has a distribution to be virtually rented out for shooting and returned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing construction of a digital camera suitable for the above-described rental system. The digital camera is stored in a water-resistant housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is covered by a paper package <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The water-resistant structure of the housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> reduces the possibility for the inside structure of the digital camera to be damaged by contingent treatment at unspecified customer as well as makes cleaning easy when returning the digital camera. However, the water-resistant structure is not explicitly shown. The paper package <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is used in expectation of getting dirt and damage caused by a single rental, and is removed and changed in consideration of cleanliness whenever the digital camera is returned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> On the paper package <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, windows are opened at respective positions corresponding to a monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, an LCD display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, a view finder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, a camera lens <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, a speed light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and an environment sensor. The monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the environment sensor <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are exposed to the outside. A transparent protection glass <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> covers a window corresponding to the camera lens <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> to protect the surface of the camera lens <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> being optically damaged. The protection glass <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is also changed whenever the digital camera is returned. A similar transparent protection glass also covers the window corresponding to the view finder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and is changed likewise. On the other hand, transparent films <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> cover windows corresponding to the LCD display and the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in order to be able to see from outside and to protect them to be got dirt. In addition, the transparent film <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made to be flexible to be able to operate the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> from outside. The transparent film <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is also changed whenever the digital camera is returned. A transparent film <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also covers the widow corresponding to the speed light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and is changed as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiment makes it possible to endure a plurality of times of rental with lowered possibility of getting internal damage of the digital camera during rental. Operating position where a customer&apos;s hands contact are constructed by low-priced material for replacing every time of rental in order to rent out the digital camera as a brand-new commodity in external appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In order to lower cost, the camera lens <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is a fixed focal length not including a focusing mechanism. F-number is also fixed. Exposure control is carried out by shutter speed of an electronic shutter with the help of a gain control of the image sensor, which is automatically controlled by a CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> on the basis of a signal from a light sensor, not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is, for example, an AV output terminal enable to monitor by outputting a shot image data to an AV input terminal of a TV while renting out a digital camera. The monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> may be a terminal for outputting image data to a monitor display of a cellular phone instead of the AV output terminal. In any event image signal from the monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> has relatively small amount in image information in comparison with total shot image signal so as to output to a monitor display within a short time period, so that it is not enough quality to store in an outer memory or make a print. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The LCD display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has simple structure, which is not an image display, capable of displaying only letters and marks such as discrimination between a shooting mode and a replay mode, the remaining number of frames to be able to shoot, the frame number output from the monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and the frame number to be deleted. Examples of buttons in the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> include a button used both as a shutter release button and an operating button, a focal-length-exchange button, a mode exchange button, an image quality exchange button, an up-and-down button for selecting a shot image frame for deleting and monitoring it, and a numeric keypad. How to use these buttons is printed on the paper wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the margin of each window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the view finder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, an wide-angle field frame is commonly arranged. When the focal-length-exchange button in the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is pressed, a telephoto field frame <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is moved into the visual field of the view finder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> by operating a field control mechanism <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The operation exchanging the focal length to the telephoto side by the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is sent to the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Although the focal length is exchanged only two steps, a telephoto and an wide-angle, in this embodiment in consideration of the cost, the number of steps can be increased in other embodiment or even a zoom lens type can be applied, which the focal length can be exchanged continuously without steps. In this case, the exchange in the field frame may be multi steps or continuous steps, or a zoom optical system may be introduced in the view finder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> controls a CMOS image sensor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> having about 3 million pixels capable of random accessing through an image sensor controller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and inputs image signals from the image sensor. In this case, when the focal length is set to the telephoto side, only the pixels of a central quarter area of the image sensor corresponding to the telephoto field frame <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are read out to obtain a fictitious telephoto image. On the other hand, when the focal length is set to the wide-angle side and image quality is set to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, a quarter of the whole pixels are read out with pixel skipping from the whole area. In this manner, the embodiment functions as a digital camera capable of shooting a telephoto image and a wide-angle image having about 750 kilo-pixels. Moreover, when shooting a wide-angle image, the whole pixels may be read out to obtain 750 kilo-pixels by adding signals of adjacent four pixels instead of reading out with pixel skipping. In this case, sensitivity is enhanced in comparison with pixel skipping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> When the image quality exchange button is set to &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, the embodiment is used as a digital camera having three million pixels instead of reading out with pixel skipping or adding signals of adjacent pixels. By the way, in the telephoto state, it is prohibited to set the image quality button to &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, which means the image quality of three million pixels. In this manner, when the focal length exchange is not carried out, the present embodiment functions as a high image quality digital camera having a semi-wide angle of view with three million pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, when a zoom lens is used as the camera lens, a zoom digital camera having high image quality of three million pixels in any focal length can be composed with relatively high cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> controls the speed light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> through a speed light controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is connected with a memory <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, stores shot images from the image sensor controller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> into the memory <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, reads out images stored in the memory <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, and outputs them from the monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> or a data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is not a removable recording medium such as a memory chip but is an ordinary memory chip installed in a digital camera. Accordingly, the cost for the recording medium itself can be reduced, omission of a card driver can also reduce cost, and omission of a slot for inserting/removing a memory card can reduce possibility of being damaged while renting out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> outputs digital data of exact amount of image information and information regarding camera usage stored in the memory <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, has a special shape suitable for reading out with a data-readout terminal in the rental center, and does not fit in the input terminal of ordinary user&apos;s PC. Accordingly, the data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has structure that is covered by the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> while the digital camera is renting out as a rental commodity and is exposed to be able to connect to the data-readout terminal only when returned and torn the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> off. On the other hand, the data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be constructed such that although the structure of the terminal itself has common shape, the procedure of reading out is made to be special in order to read out efficiently in the rental center. In this case also, the data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has structure that is covered by the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> while the digital camera is renting out as a rental commodity and is exposed to be able to connect to the data-readout terminal only when returned and torn the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, it may be possible to construct such that the data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has a common shape such as USB terminal to be able to read out from the ordinary user&apos;s PC, and is exposed to outside by a window formed on the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in order to be able to read out data from user&apos;s PC while renting out. In this case, it is premised that customers care the image data by themselves and that prints are made by customer&apos;s printer. However, rapid progress of technology regarding PCs, printers as well as digital cameras makes it difficult financially for ordinal customer to replace with the up-to-date model. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, not only rental business of digital cameras but also the image-data-readout business for caring and printing are left to professional agents. Accordingly, the customer can enjoy ultra-advanced quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A electric power circuit <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> supplies electric power from a battery <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> such as two AA batteries to each portion of the digital camera. Since the digital camera according to the embodiment is designed as a rental commodity to secure enough electric supply while renting out, it is not necessary for the customer to change battery. Therefore, a cap for the battery case storing the battery <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is covered by the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, so that replacement of the battery can be possible only when the camera is returned to the recycle center and the wrapping <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is removed. In order to control the battery, the recycle center prints the date of battery replacement on the wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> when the new wrappings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is applied after replacing the battery. In a store of the convenience store system such as the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, not only the voltage of the battery but the date of battery replacement are checked. A digital camera whose battery was replaced more than a predetermined time period ago is returned to the rental center as an expiration-of-best-before-date commodity. By using the control method described above, only a digital camera equipped with a battery having enough capacity capable of operating whole rental period is rent out. The information of the returned digital camera is used as the rate of turnover of the digital camera as a rental commodity to the customer and as the state of stock in the store such as the first store <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Since the information regarding the date of battery replacement is also stored in the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, when the enough electric supply cannot be guaranteed in comparison with the estimated return date, the same model capable of being guaranteed is substituted. In addition, the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> prepares warning regarding the state that the electric power supply cannot be guaranteed comparing the date of battery replacement, the estimated return date, and the date of renting out and warning regarding exceeding the rental period. When image information is output from the monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> displays the warning information superimposing onto the image information to display on a TV screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Moreover, on observing image from the monitor output <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> shown on a TV screen, the customer can delete unnecessary image, designate the number of sheets to be printed and the size of the print by using the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The designated information is recorded in the memory <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> through the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in accordance with a predetermined format. The designated information recorded in the memory together with the image information is read out from the data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> when returning the digital camera, so that the designated print is carried out. The customer can revise the designation of the print at the rental center when returning the digital camera or input the designation of the print at the rental center when returning the digital camera without inputting the designated information in the digital camera in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is also used in the recycle center when checking the function of the returned digital camera. In the recycle center, an inspection apparatus is connected to the data terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the returned digital camera, sends various inspection signals to the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and checks responses to these inspection signals from the CPU <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in detail. Accordingly, the functions and quality of respective parts are evaluated in order to conclude whether the digital camera can be recycled as a commodity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the environment sensor <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, sensors for easily detecting any one or any combination of temperature, humidity, air pressure, and noise, and a position information sensor on the basis of the GPS system are arranged. Therefore, their outputs when shooting is recorded with reference to the shot image. Moreover, the following information is also recorded with reference to the shot image such as output of the photosensor for exposure control, whether or not speed light is used, whether or not pseudo-telephoto is set, the time of shooting, the time interval to the previous shooting, and the designated number of sheets for the print. When the file number of each image is given serially in accordance with a predetermined rule, how many images had been there between the remained images can be identified, so that the history of the deletion is also recorded with reference to the remained image. These information is read out from the data readout terminal together with the image information when returning the digital camera, sent to the database center to carry out statistical processing and analysis, so that the result is reported to the general center to be reflected in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a next model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in detail. As described before, the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> receives feedback from the database center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the communication networks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively, so as to reflect in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a next model. In the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, information is mutually exchanged to reflect in R&amp;D planning of a next model. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A, a manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, and a disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C in the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> exchange information closely with each other by the computer network so as to carry out total cost control throughout the product&apos;s life cycle from R&amp;D to disposal. Moreover, the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A located in the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a recycle plant which is included in the information exchange system in the same way as the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B and the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing procedure of the cost control and is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, design data of a new model is sent from the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A to the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, and the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, respectively. In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the production cost of the new model is estimated by a computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>E of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B on the basis of the production performance of the past models and the design data of the new model. In step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the recycle cost of the new model is estimated by a computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C of the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A on the basis of the recycle performance of the past models and the design data of the new model. In step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the disposal cost of the new model is estimated by a computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C on the basis of the disposal performance of the past models and the design data of the new model. The order of the steps from S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be set arbitrarily. These steps may also be carried out simultaneously. When all estimation have sent to a central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G of the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the total cost estimation of the new model is carried out by the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G in step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, whether the total cost is cleared the target cost of the business project of the new model or not is checked. When the target cost has not been cleared, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G sets the cost down target for each of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, and the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C. In the procedure to set the cost down target, upon receiving the information regarding voluntary cost down plan from each computer of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, and the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G may adjust each plan. When each cost down target has been set and fed back, cost analysis is carried out by each computer of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, and the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C and the most effective item for cost down is extracted in step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the information regarding the extracted cost down item is exchanged. For example, when a new equipment investment is necessary for a disassembly process of a new model, and when an indication is suggested that the design should be changed to be able to disassemble by an existing equipment, the indication is sent from the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C to the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G together with the designated delivery address. The central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G sends the indication to a computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D of the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A, the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>E of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, or the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C of the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A in accordance with the designated delivery address. Another example of cost down item from the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C is that when a portion of a process is to be changed from managerial request of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, the disposal plant asks the central computer whether the change complies with the design, the manufacturing, and the recycle of the new model or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the same way, when a rationalization item exists in a manufacturing process, the information is sent from the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>E of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B to the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G together with the designated address. In accordance with the designated address, the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G sends the information to the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D of the R$D department, the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, and the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C of the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A. For example of these information, there are such an inquiry to the R&amp;D department whether a design suitable for the rationalization in the manufacturing process is possible or not, and an inquiry to the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C and the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A whether the rationalization causes cost up in the disposal process and the recycle process or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when a rationalization item exists in a recycle process, the information is sent from the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C of the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A to the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G together with the designated address. In accordance with the designated address, the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G sends the information to the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D of the R$D department, the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>E of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, and the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when a good designing idea for cost down comes up, the idea is sent from the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D of the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A to the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G together with the designated address. In accordance with the designated address, the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G sends the idea to the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>E of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, and the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C of the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the information exchange regarding cost down items has completed, in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> each division makes a cost down plan on the basis of the information received from the other divisions and submits it for exchanging with each other through the computer network. For example, the reply for the designation regarding design change for using existing equipment submitted from the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C as described above is sent from the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D of the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A to the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C through the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G. Examples of the information include an answer for the inquiry whether design change of the new model according to the designation is possible or not, and an inquiry whether the design change plan meets the request from the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C or not. Moreover, examples of information sent from the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B to the computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C through the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G include an inquiry whether the change in the manufacturing process meets the request of the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, and a suggestion of the disposal method in view of the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. Further explanation, however, is abbreviated; a response, a suggestion and a re-inquiry to the information of the cost down item as shown in step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are carried out in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the execution is carried out by the communication between computers of respective divisions through the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the above-described case, although the direct information exchange between two parties is explained, the information exchange in steps S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not limited to this. For example, the indirect information exchange may also be possible such that the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B having received design data of the new product from the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A forms manufacturing information of the new product on the basis of the design data, and sends the manufacturing information to the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C. In this case, the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C estimates a disposal cost on the basis of the design data information of the new product directly received from the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A together with the manufacturing information of the new product received from the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The above-described indirect information exchange may happen when estimating the recycle cost in the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A. For example, it is the indirect information exchange that the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B having received design data of the new product from the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A forms manufacturing information of the new product on the basis of the design data, and sends the manufacturing information to the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A. In this case also, the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A estimates a recycle cost on the basis of the design data information of the new product directly received from the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A together with the manufacturing information of the new product received from the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Further explanation, however, is abbreviated; in steps S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, various kinds of information exchange may be possible between the R&amp;D department <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A, the manufacturing plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, the disposal plant <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, and the recycle center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> On completion of the information exchange in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In steps S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the cost is re-estimated in consideration of the information received in steps S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, when the re-estimated cost does not clear the cost target, the steps starting from step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are repeated. In this manner, the steps from S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are repeated until the cost target has been cleared. When the cost target is cleared, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to complete this flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In general commodity, the business cost includes development, manufacturing, distribution, and sales. However, in the present invention, the business cost includes those costs, in addition, for returning the commodity, recycle, re-distribution, and disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the business cost control triggered by the development of the new product has been explained. The system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> burdens each division with the business cost control triggered by making the parts use in common with a plurality of models. From this point of view, information regarding planning and practice of the cost down is transmitted from computers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>F of respective divisions under control of the central computer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>G.

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a case that a digital camera is distributed as an ordinary commodity not as a rental one according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the distribution routes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the communication networks <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are the same as the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, so the duplicated explanation is abbreviated by attaching the same reference number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, a customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> functions as the sole window for a customer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. At first, it sells digital cameras to the customer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as a camera store. A delivery route <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> includes a case for sales on the store as well that for delivery of an order. However, the delivery route <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is not a one-way traffic. On purchasing a digital camera, the customer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> makes a maintenance and disposal contract with the customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. According to the contract, the customer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> returns the digital camera to the customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through the delivery route <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> when performing repair, conversion, upgrading, and replacement of the digital camera. The returned digital camera is sent to the logistics center <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the distribution route <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is further sent to the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through distribution route <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be disposed of if necessary. These functions are the same as the first embodiment, so the detailed explanations are abbreviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Although a customer can dispose of the digital camera by oneself when it falls into disuse because of replacement or the like, the cost of the disposal becomes higher than that of returning to the customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> with making the maintenance and disposal contract. Assuming that arbitrary disposal disobedient to a predetermined procedure is prohibited by law because of the global environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be located scatteringly in a lot of locations as a store where customers visit directly. On the other hand, the customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be concentrated as a single center when the sales pattern is non-store retailing such as mail order and the Internet sales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The system according to the third embodiment also carries out various service business other than the sales of digital cameras. The sales includes print service, service for writing on a CD-R, service for keeping of the shot image data, etc. The customer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can enjoy the service by directly visiting the customer center <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or by accessing to the customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from the customer&apos;s PC through the Internet to receiver or transmit necessary image data and image order data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> On purchasing a digital camera or applying the service, new customer&apos;s customer control information such as name, address, telephone number, mail address, credit card number, etc. is recorded in the customer center and a customer ID number is issued. In the case of a new customer, privacy information such as age, sex, etc. is also input in the customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A with the consensus of the customer. Moreover, information regarding camera usage included in the shot images with the consensus of the customer. These points are the same as the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> A service center <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has a customer database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A, a image database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B, a printer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>C, and a CD-R driver <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>D. The functions of these elements are the same as the first embodiment, so the explanation is abbreviated. However, in the third embodiment, the printer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>C and the CD-R driver <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>D are arranged in the service center, so that the print printed by the printer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>C or the CD-R recorded image data by the CD-R driver <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>D is sent to the customer center through the distribution route <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in accordance with the customer&apos;s request. In the third embodiment, all windows in connection with the customer are concentrated in the customer center, so that the customer does not get lost. All communication necessary for the service is exchanged between the customer center <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the service center <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through a communication network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> General center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> takes charge of general function including ordinary research and development, manufacturing as well as disposal. Although the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may usually be one in a single rental system, the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be divided into more than one according to circumstances. Moreover, a plurality of functions of a general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be divided into a plurality of centers locating in different locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> It is the same as the first embodiment that the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> receives statistical information of commercial distribution of the customer database <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A to reflect in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a next model. In this case, since the majority of the sold commodity is collected through disposal, the market information can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment described above, since disposal function of the general center <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is included in the product circulation, no digital camera is come out from the rental system as a reject, so that zero-emission for the global environment can be accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing construction of a digital camera according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The digital camera is circulate as a used-up-in-a-short-term commodity on the basis of recycle such as a disposal camera not as a rental camera. In the fourth embodiment also, it is considered as a standard distribution mode that the digital camera storing digital image information regarding shot images is returned including the camera for print. However, since this is not a rental system, the property right of the digital camera belongs to the purchaser. Accordingly, it is the system that the user can dispose the used digital camera at user&apos;s own responsibility after reading out digital image data into a user&apos;s PC without returning it. In the explanation below, the construction in common with the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is attached with the same reference number and the duplicated explanation will be abbreviated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a service system according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the service system, an existing convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and an existing print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> work with a digital camera maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. By the way, the digital camera maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has a recycle function for a digital camera. The convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> has an ordinary stock and distribution system and the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> acts the function of a hub in the logistics system. The arrows <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> described later denote distribution using the ordinary stock and distribution system in the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Although the distribution system is actually carried out through the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for the purpose of simplicity we do not make mention of this point in the following explanation. The print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> carries on the business by receiving the print order on the basis of digital image data from the customer and delivering the print to the customer by using an existing home delivery service in response to the customer&apos;s request. Likewise, the print shop carries on the service for keeping digital image data in response to the customer&apos;s request. The fourth embodiment is accomplished by the cooperation of the existing systems. By the way, the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> have computers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>A, respectively for the purpose of the cooperation to be able to communicate with a bank <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> by a network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The service system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> will be explained below in order of distribution shown with the reference number (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) through (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) attached to each arrow. At first, the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> lays in a stock of digital cameras from the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> or a store by using the ordinary stock route shown by an arrow <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Composition of the stock price and the way of payment will be explained later. The stocked digital cameras are displayed in the convenience store in the same way the other commodities are displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> A customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> purchases a digital camera as shown in an arrow <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and pays the price as shown in an arrow <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. As described later, the price includes everything including print cost for the digital image, so that the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> purchased the digital camera can enjoy every service without paying further. The payment of the purchasing digital camera is made, for example, at the store of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in cash. Without visiting a store, the customer may purchase a digital camera by assuming that the arrow <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> denotes the delivery by the distribution system of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the arrow <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> denotes the direct debit of the bank account by a credit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> An arrow <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> denotes the case that the unsold digital camera is returned from the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The return is made when the mode has become outdated to be unpopular or when the capacity of the battery cannot be guaranteed because of a long-term display on the store. This is the same as an expiration-of-best-before-date commodity in the fresh food. Adjustment of an account on returning is also described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> purchased the digital camera returns the digital camera stored digital images to the convenience store after shooting and makes a print order as shown in the arrow <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The customer may make the order at the store of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> or may ask the distribution system for collecting the camera. The convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> delivers the digital camera stored digital images to the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> by the distribution system as shown in an arrow <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> reads out digital image information from the received digital camera to make print. The completed print is delivered to the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for being delivered to the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> through the distribution system as shown in an arrow <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> receives the completed print at the store as shown in an arrow <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The arrow <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> may denote the case that the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> receives the print by the home delivery through the distribution system of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the used digital camera having been read out the digital image information is returned to the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> as a hub to be provided for recycle as shown in arrows <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The reason to go through the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is to prevent from making a new distribution route between the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> other than the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the arrows <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are carried out by the regular shuttle service of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> reciprocally moving between the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (specifically the distribution center <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. It is needless to say that a direct service that directly delivers the used digital camera from the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may be provided. Anyway, regarding the necessary distribution of the service, the stock and distribution system of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is effectively used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Fee adjustment between the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is carried out between each account in the bank <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> on the basis of the communication between computers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>A and the communication between each computer and the bank <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a table showing summarized fee structure and fee adjustment in which the symbol marks &ocir; and &xcirc; show a degree of relevance. The other points are described in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when a digital camera is stocked, the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> charges the total amount of a trade price of the digital camera and a print fee to the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Among them, the print fee is a surrogate collection for the print shop. In this case, delivery cost for recovering used camera carried out by the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in stead of the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> as shown in the arrows <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is deducted from the total amount. The symbol mark &ocir; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> denotes the final receiver of the charge. When the digital camera is stocked, the final receiver of the trade price of the camera is the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. However, the recovery cost of the camera is deducted as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, when a digital camera is stocked, the recovery cost of the camera is deducted from the trade price for all cameras in advance regardless of whether the camera is actually recovered or not. This has a shade of meaning of a consignment fee from the maker in order for the convenience store system to construct the system for recovering digital camera. There is another embodiment other than that described above that although the above-mentioned deduction is not carried out when a digital camera is stocked, the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> charges the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> with the camera recovery cost in accordance with the result when the recovery of the used camera as shown in the arrows <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is actually happened. Anyway, the recovery of the camera is consigned to the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> having the distribution system from the maker and the camera recovery cost is charged to the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> by the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Then, at the time of camera sales, the convenient store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> charges the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> the summation of the sales price (trade price and margin) of the digital camera, print fee, and print service administration cost indicated by the arrows from <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> (including print delivery cost shown in the arrows <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). Among them, the amount of the print fee is the same at the time of stocking the camera. The final receiver of the margin and the service administration cost at the time of camera sales is the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In fee adjustment at the time of returning the camera in comparison with the time of stocking the camera, only the relation of the payer and the payee is reversed, but the fee structure or the summation of the fee does not change. By the way, although the print fee at the time of stocking the camera was a surrogate collection by the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the print was not made at the time of returning the camera, so that the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> as a final receiver receives the refund including the print fee from the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the fee adjustment is not carried out item by item but the difference between the stock and the return is adjusted collectively between the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, for example, at the end of each month. In the example mentioned above, full amount of stock price with respect to the returned camera is refunded by the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. This is the case, for the purpose of simplicity, that all responsibility for the sales of the digital camera is burdened on the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, so the convenient store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> does not take any risk. When the responsibility of the product planning exists in the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> naturally bear the loss caused by unsold commodity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> At the time of forming print, the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> charges the print fee actually generated while printing to the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The fee is the same as that collected by the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> as surrogate collection when the digital camera was stocked. The final receiver of the print fee is naturally the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The print fee and the service administration cost are both charged to the customer in advance on the assumption that the print is carried out. This promotes that the used camera is recycled by the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in order to accomplish a zero-emission society. Not returning the digital camera means that the customer has intentionally given up the print service, so the customer owes the charge. Therefore, the prepaid print fee and the service administration cost are divided between the maker <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, respectively, which bear the risk for keeping the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> By using the above-described business model, the convenient store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> obtain the following advantages. In the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, digital cameras are expected as very promotable commodities contributing to profit. Adding the print service administration may increases turnover rate of the stock distribution system so as to be able to lower the cost. Moreover, adding the print service administration as an attraction is effective to increase sales of all commodities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can secure large orders and save the trouble of taking order and delivering print. As long as the print order receives through the convenient store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the print shop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> collects the print fee only from the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> not from the individual customer, so that accounting becomes simple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> can obtain an effective sales route and a means for distributing the commodity without investing on its own account. Since the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> can make print order and receive print by using distribution route of the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the customer can receive the print with much less delivery cost in comparison with making print order with delivering through ordinary home delivery service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> As described above, working each existing system in cooperation results in enhancing convenience for the customer as well as contributing realization of a zero-emission society. Although the fourth embodiment is not a rental system, the great portion of the digital camera can be collected by making print order. Moreover, since the system is not a rental system, it is not necessary for the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> or the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to control rental commodities, so that the print order may be controlled separately from the sales of the digital camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In the above-described explanation, although the digital camera distributing in the system according to the fourth embodiment has the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is needless to say that the digital camera may have the construction, for example, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> not limiting to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The digital camera distributing in the fourth embodiment has the following merits over the disposal camera. The customer can shoot again any number of times. The customer can confirm images by using a TV before making a print order. The customer can ask to keep the digital image data. The customer can read in the digital image data to the customer&apos;s PC for processing it if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The business model cooperating with the existing systems such as the maker, the convenience store system, and print shop using the distributing system of the convenience store system does not limit the object to the digital camera. It is possible for the business model to apply to the distribution of the disposal camera. When it is applied to the disposal camera, the service administration cost being received by the convenience store system is not charged at the time of sales shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. It may be charged to the customer when the customer brings a camera, finished shooting, for making a print order or when the customer receives the print delivered to the convenience store system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> can be applied to the rental commodity having the charge system such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this case, the maker shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> may be considered as the rental shop. The &ldquo;stock of a camera&rdquo; may be understood as the stock for the rental. In this case, trade price of a camera may be considered as &ldquo;trade price of the rental&rdquo;, so that it means the share for the rental shop in the rental fee. The &ldquo;sales of a camera&rdquo; may be considered as the &ldquo;camera rental&rdquo;. In this case, the net rental fee for a customer is the &ldquo;trade price of the rental&rdquo; added by the margin of the convenience store system. The service administration cost and the print fee is added to this as the same manner as the fourth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the charge system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is applied, the print fee in the state of the &ldquo;stock of a camera&rdquo; and &ldquo;camera rental&rdquo; corresponds to the &ldquo;basic fee&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and differs from the &ldquo;print fee&rdquo; actually charged to the &ldquo;rental shop&rdquo; from the print shop at the time of &ldquo;making print&rdquo;. The procedure to return the difference and additional charge for excess rental term are adjusted between the customer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> at the time shown in the arrows <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The fee adjustment is carried out between the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the rental shop (substitution of the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>) communicating between computers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>A and with the bank <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing construction of a digital camera according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. The component having the similar construction as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference> is attached the same reference number so as to abbreviate duplicated explanation. The digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> according to the fifth embodiment is an ordinary digital camera, not a rental camera nor a disposable commodity. The digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, however, is composed in consideration of recycle and collection after being made redundant. Image data is stored in a recording medium <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> such as a memory card capable of attaching to a slot <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> for the memory medium, not in a memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Image data as well as usage data in connection with the image data are stored in the memory medium <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. When a customer uses the image data and the usage data stored in the memory medium <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the image data and the usage data can be read out by removing the memory medium <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> from the slot <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and inserting to a slot for the memory medium of an outside PC. Moreover, the customer can read out the image data and the usage data by connecting the data terminal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to an outside PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has a historical memory <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> that records various usage data of the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. Examples of data includes the usage data being the same one stored in the recording medium <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the output of the environmental sensor <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, output of the photosensor for exposure control, whether or not speed light is used, whether or not pseudo-telephoto is set, and the time of shooting. As the usage history, not only the data when shooting but the history of operation prior to shooting and the history of readout operation using the operating portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be stored. Moreover, the dates of shipment, wholesale, sales are also stored in the historical memory <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has a customer information memory <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> that stores various data regarding the customer. Examples of the data includes customer&apos;s administration information such as customer&apos;s name, address, telephone number, mail address, credit card number, customer&apos;s setting data regarding shooting and image processing, camera usage contract with the customer, and the password. The memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has an agreement data memory <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> that stores the condition designated by the customer to each information whether it is permitted to be read out or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Each information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is kept in the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> after the information has been read out from the recording medium <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> through the slot <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, so that the whole usage history from shipment to collection of the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> can be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> When a digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is collected, each information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is read out at the collected place in accordance with the agreement stored in the agreement data memory <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, sent to the database center to be statistically processed and analyzed. The result is sent to the general center to be reflected in R&amp;D, manufacturing and disposal planning of a future model. Furthermore, the customer information read out at the collected place from the customer information memory <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> in accordance with the customer&apos;s agreement can be transcribed upon customer&apos;s request to the memory of a replacing camera or a bought-at-the-other-place camera brought in the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> together with a disposing camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Each information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is automatically input in the process of distributing and using the camera and is input or changed by the sales person or the customer using the operation portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> with the help of the LCD display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In the course of ordinary use of the digital camera, the customer is prohibited from reading out each information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In particular, the information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is read out through the data terminal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in accordance with a particular protocol unable to be used by the customer. Moreover, it is possible to prohibit the customer from reading out by changing the shape of the data terminal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having a particular shape unable to be accessed by the customer. Furthermore, in order that the customer cannot access, the data terminal for reading out data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be covered by the wrappings in response to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In addition, when it is constructed that the data is read out by a non-contact readout means such as a radio wave, the data can be effectively read out at the time of collection, so that it meets the purpose to prohibit the customer&apos;s access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> according to the fifth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> being different from those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference>, customers can change the battery <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> by themselves by opening the cap of the battery cell <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a collection service system according to the fifth embodiment. Since the most functions of it are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the same reference number is attached to the same composition so as to abbreviate the duplicated explanation. In the service system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the collection and the sales for replacement of the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> according to the fifth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> are carried out in addition to the distribution of the disposal commodity shown in arrows (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) through (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> stocks the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> from the maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> or the outlet store by using the ordinary stock route shown in the arrow <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The recycle cost is included in the stock price. The recycle cost is a fee that the designated maker <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> can charge when shipping the digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a part of it is paid to the recycle administrative organization through the bank <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The digital camera <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> stocked by the convenience store system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is displayed in the store as same as other commodities. </paragraph>

The recycle system is composed of a computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, a monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, and digital cameras <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> plays a main part of the recycle system being connected with the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, and the digital cameras <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The inner composition of the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing the inner composition of the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. The computer terminal is composed of a CPU <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, a communication circuit <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, a connector <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and a display circuit <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> stores a control program described later. The CPU <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is a circuit for carrying out the control program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> displays an image signal generated by the display circuit <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> in the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> being run by a maker which manufactured the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is connected with the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> via a communication network such as the Internet. The server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> has a memory for storing an image data shot by a digital camera and a shooting condition data of the digital camera. The digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> having been used by a user is brought for recycle.

Each digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> has the function of a cellular phone, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Then, the control procedure of the recycle system according to the sixth embodiment is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The recycle system carries out the control that reads out setting information regarding the shooting condition and the like stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> being collected for recycle and registers the setting information read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> with the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> purchased newly. In the recycle system, a lot of setting information can be transferred from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. Examples of setting information includes time, font of a letter, registered word, customer name, custom setting, setting for shooting (resolution, compression method, used auto focus area, and setting for speed light), image correction, provider, all kinds of password, contract, credit card, telephone directory, mail address, and profile of the customer. When the digital camera has the function other than camera such as payment and commuter pass as well as cellular phone, the setting information further increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> By using the recycle system, the customer can use the newly purchased digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> under the same setting as the used digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> without inputting the various setting information from the beginning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> in the recycle system is arranged at a window where the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is collected for recycle. The customer who wants the setting information to transfer from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> goes to the collection window to carry out registration and returns the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to the window after completion of the registration. As a result, collection rate of the digital camera for recycle increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The control procedure carried out by the recycle system according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention is specifically explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The recycle system explained here is an example that the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is arranged at a digital camera store where the newly purchased digital camera and the collecting digital camera for recycle are distributed together. The optimum control method is explained under the condition that the collecting digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the newly purchased digital camera exist together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference> are flow charts showing the control procedure carried out by the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the recycle system. The flow starts when the system detects that the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is connected to the connector <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> of the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, model information is read out from the connected digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, whether the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is the model corresponding to the program or not is discriminated on the basis of the readout model information. When the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is corresponding to the program, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> shows the notation that the connected digital camera does not correspond to the program and the flow comes to an end. In step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a certification page is shown on the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The certification page demands to input necessary information to certify the owner of the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. In the sixth embodiment, the certification page demands to input customer ID number and password provided when purchasing. The reason why certification is carried out is to prevent a person other than the owner of the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> from obtaining the setting information and the like stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, whether certification information is input to the certification page or not is checked. When the information is input, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, in order to check whether the input information is correct or not, the certification information is sent to the server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the data stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is read out to send to the server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> of the maker. The information sent to the maker is those information in connection with shooting history such as total number of shooting and the like stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, which can be reflected in R&amp;D and marketing of the digital camera available in the near future. The information in connection with the customer&apos;s privacy is not sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, whether the server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> certifies it or not is checked. When it is certified, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, showing on the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> that it is certified, the system automatically reads out setting information such as setting for shooting and the like from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the notation that it is not certified is shown on the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, whether the readout has completed or not is checked. When the readout has completed, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to continue reading out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the setting information read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is deleted. Moreover, a page demanding to connect the new digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is shown on the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, whether the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is connected or not is checked. When the camera is connected, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, the model information is read out from the connected digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, whether the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is the model corresponding to the program or not is discriminated. When the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> corresponds to the program, the setting information such as setting for shooting and the like read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> can be converted to a data suitable for the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. When the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> corresponds to the program, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, a page for selecting setting information to be registered with the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The customer can select the setting information to be registered. This is because there is a possibility that the newly purchased digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> should not use the setting information read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> since the new digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> usually has higher specification in comparison with the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. For example, it is assumed that the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> has 3 areas of the AF (Auto Focus) area capable of selecting area <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> has 5 areas of the AF area capable of selecting area <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When the customer had used the AF setting of area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the page capable of selecting area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which permits to increase reliability is shown on the display without automatically setting area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. An example of the selection page is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. In the selection page in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, items to be select and alternatives of the items are generated in accordance with the function of the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The item whose setting has not been changed from the initial setting at the time of shipment of the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is not changed from the initial setting at the time of shipment of the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. In the item whose function has improved in the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> than <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the better setting is automatically selected. For example, in the item of the AF area in the selection page, area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is selected as an initial setting instead of area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In addition, in the selection page in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19, a</cross-reference> registration button is arranged. On clicking the registration button, the data is registered with the connected digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The explanation returns to the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>. In step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, whether the registration button arranged in the selection page is clicked or not is checked. When the registration button is clicked, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, the setting information read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is converted to the data form able to be used by the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and is registered with the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. Naturally, the data is not converted when the data read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> can be used for the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> without conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a page notifying the completion of the registration with the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is shown on the monitor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. A customer registration button for moving to the customer registration is arranged in the page. By clicking the customer registration button, the customer can successively carry out the customer registration for the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> by using the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. At that time, the customer can complete the customer registration with a minimum input by using the information read out from the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the customer information of the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, whether the customer registration button is clicked or not is checked. When the customer registration button is clicked, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow goes to the end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, whether the maker of the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and that of the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> are the same or not is checked. When the makers are the same, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, since the customer information has already registered at the time of registering the customer information of the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the customer registration of the digital camera <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is completed without newly registering information. The customer ID number and the password are the same as those obtained for the digital camera <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the ordinary customer registration is carried out. When the registration has completed in accordance with the instruction, a new customer ID number and a password are issued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> As described above, if the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the recycle system is placed at the sales window of the camera store carrying out both camera sales and collection for recycle, the setting information such as setting for shooting regarding the old digital camera for recycle can be handed over to the new digital camera when purchasing the new digital camera. In order to use the recycle system, the customer brings the old camera to the camera store, so that the old camera can be collected effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Since the system prohibit reading out data stored in the digital camera without certifying the customer, misuse of the data stored in the old camera can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, the certification data input by the customer is checked by the server computer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> connected with the digital camera. However, the certification may be carried out in the digital camera by storing the certification data in the digital camera in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In the recycle system, since the customer can carry out the customer registration as well as data registration with the new digital camera, the customer can carry out the customer registration on the occasion of data registration with the new digital camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Then, a recycle system according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention is going to be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The recycle system of the embodiment uses a customer&apos;s PC in stead of the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> A terminal of the customer&apos;s PC is used as the computer terminal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>.
