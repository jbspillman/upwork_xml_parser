<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to systems for determining the position of an object inside a human body, and specifically to the use of such systems in guiding tools and other devices used in medical procedures. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The use of implanted markers or clips for surgical guidance is known in the art. For example, upon identifying a suspicious lesion in the breast, a radiologist may mark the location by inserting a simple radio-opaque wire at the location of the lesion while viewing an image of the breast under mammography. When a biopsy is subsequently performed, the surgeon follows the wire to find the exact location of the lesion, so as to be certain of removing tissue from the correct area of the breast. Radiologists currently use this sort of location marking for approximately 40% of all breast biopsies. This careful approach significantly reduces the occurrence of false negative biopsy findings and increases the overall diagnostic accuracy of the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Despite the proven usefulness of such simple biopsy markers, it would be preferable for the surgeon to be able to choose a pathway to the biopsy site independently, rather than having to follow the wire inserted by the radiologist. Furthermore, wire-based markers are not appropriate to other invasive procedures, such as lung biopsies, or to applications in which a marker must be left in the body for extended periods. It has therefore been suggested to use a wireless emitter, or &ldquo;tag,&rdquo; to mark target locations in the body for surgery and therapy. Such a tag contains no internal power source, but is rather actuated by an external energy field, typically applied from outside the body. The tag then emits ultrasonic or electromagnetic energy, which is detected by antennas or other sensors outside the body. The detected signals may be used to determine position coordinates of the tag. Passive ultrasonic reflectors are one simple example of such tags. Other passive tags receive and re-emit electromagnetic radiation, typically with a frequency and/or phase shift. Hybrid tags, combining ultrasonic and electromagnetic interactions, are also known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,818, to Blair et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a method and device for the detection of unwanted objects in surgical sites, based on a medically inert detection tag which is affixed to objects such as medical sponges or other items used in body cavities during surgery. The detection tag contains a single signal emitter, such as a miniature ferrite rod and coil and capacitor element embedded therein. Alternatively, the tag includes a flexible thread composed of a single loop wire and capacitor element. A detection device is utilized to locate the tag by pulsed emission of a wide-band transmission signal. The tag resonates with a radiated signal, in response to the wide-band transmission, at its own single non-predetermined frequency, within the wide-band range. The return signals build up in intensity at a single (though not predefined) detectable frequency over ambient noise, so as to provide recognizable detection signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,873, to Hirschi et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a system to verify the location of a tube or other object inserted into the body. It incorporates a resonant electrical circuit attached to the object which resonates upon stimulation by a hand-held RF transmitter/receiver external to the body. The electromagnetic field generated due to resonance of the circuit is detected by the hand-held device, which subsequently turns on a series of LEDs to indicate to the user the direction to the target. An additional visual display indicates when the transmitter/receiver is directly above the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,724, to Doron et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a telemetry system for providing spatial positioning information from within a patient&apos;s body. The system includes an implantable telemetry unit having (a) a first transducer, for converting a power signal received from outside the body into electrical power for powering the telemetry unit; (b) a second transducer, for receiving a positioning field signal that is received from outside the body; and (c) a third transducer, for transmitting a locating signal to a site outside the body, in response to the positioning field signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,332,089, to Acker et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a medical probe such as a catheter, which is guided within the body of a patient by determining the relative positions of the probe relative to another probe, for example by transmitting nonionizing radiation to or from field transducers mounted on both probes. In one embodiment, a site probe is secured to a lesion within the body, and an instrument probe for treating the lesion may be guided to the lesion by monitoring relative positions of the probes. Two or more probes may be coordinated with one another to perform a medical procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Passive sensors and transponders, fixed to implanted devices, can also be used for conveying other diagnostic information to receivers outside the body. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,873, to Govari et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a stent adapted for measuring a fluid flow in the body of a subject. The stent contains a coil, which receives energy from an electromagnetic field irradiating the body so as to power a transmitter for transmitting a pressure-dependent signal to a receiver outside the body. In one embodiment, the transmitter is based on a tunnel diode oscillator circuit, suitably biased so as to operate in a negative resistance regime, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As another example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,206,835 to Spillman et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes an implant device that includes an integral, electrically-passive sensing circuit, communicating with an external interrogation circuit. The sensing circuit includes an inductive element and has a has a frequency-dependent variable impedance loading effect on the interrogation circuit, varying in relation to the sensed parameter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is an object of some aspects of the present invention to provide methods and systems for guidance of medical procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a wireless tag is implanted in a patient&apos;s body to mark the location of a planned diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. During the procedure, the region of the body under treatment is irradiated with electromagnetic radiation (typically radio frequency&mdash;RF&mdash;radiation) or ultrasonic radiation, causing the tag to return energy indicative of its location. The energy returned from the tag is detected by a receiver in order to determine the location and orientation of a therapeutic or diagnostic device, such as a surgical probe, relative to the tag. The radiation source and the receiver for detecting the returned energy may be integrated into the therapeutic or diagnostic device, or they may alternatively be contained in one or more separate units. In the latter case, when the receiver is separate from the therapeutic or diagnostic device, the receiver is preferably also capable of determining the position and orientation of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The location and orientation of the therapeutic or diagnostic device relative to the tag within the body are shown on a display, for use by the treating physician in guiding the device to the appropriate location. In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the display is integrated in a single unit with the therapeutic or diagnostic device that must be guided, for example, on a handle of the device. The operator is thus able to guide the device while looking only at the tool and the region under treatment, without having to look away toward a separate display as in systems known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Various different types of wireless tags may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Preferably, the tag is passive, in the sense that it contains no internal energy source, but rather derives all the energy that it needs to operate from the applied electromagnetic or ultrasonic radiation. Exemplary passive tags are described in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/029,595 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/029,473, filed Dec. 21, 2001, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and whose disclosure is likewise incorporated herein by reference. Other types of tags, as are known in the art, may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Systems and methods in accordance with embodiments of the present invention present invention are particularly useful in guiding biopsies and other invasive procedures performed on soft tissues, such as the breasts, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Implantation of a passive tag can be used both to provide initial guidance to the location of a suspected lesion and to provide further guidance to return to the same location in subsequent treatment and follow-up. Such guidance systems may also be used in non-invasive therapies, such as focused radiotherapy and ultrasound, to focus high-intensity radiation from a source outside the body onto the precise location of a lesion. Other applications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There is therefore provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for performing a medical procedure on a tissue within a body of a subject, including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> a wireless tag configured to be fixed to the tissue and adapted to emit radiation, thereby causing first signals to be generated indicative of a location of the tag in the body; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> a processing unit, coupled to process the first signals so as to determine coordinates of the tag relative to the probe, and to drive the display responsive to the coordinates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the invasive medical tool further includes a receiver, which is adapted to receive the radiation emitted by the wireless tag, and to generate the first signals responsive thereto for processing by the processing unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further preferably, the invasive medical tool includes a tool position sensor, which is adapted to generate second signals indicative of the coordinates of the probe, and the processing unit is coupled to process the second signals together with the first signals so as to determine the coordinates of the tag relative to the probe. In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes one or more field generators, which are fixed in the external frame of reference and which are adapted to generate electromagnetic fields in a vicinity of the tissue, and the wireless tag and the tool position sensor include field sensors, in which electrical currents flow responsive to the electromagnetic fields, and wherein the first and second signals are indicative of the electrical currents flowing in the field sensors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the display is adapted to present a further visual indication of a distance from the probe to the tag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the invasive medical tool is adapted to perform a surgical procedure on the tissue. Additionally or alternatively, the invasive tool includes an endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> There is also provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for performing a medical procedure on a tissue within a body of a subject, including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> fixing a wireless tag to the tissue; </paragraph>

In the embodiment pictured in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, package <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a base that can be grasped by a radiologist using a suitable inserter tool (not shown in the figures) to position tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a desired location in soft tissue of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferably, circuitry <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprises a tunnel diode (not shown), such as a <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>n<highlight><bold>3712</bold></highlight> diode, which is configured together with antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and capacitor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to form a tunnel diode oscillator circuit, as is known in the art. For example, the antenna may be formed by a small loop of 0.5 mm wire, and coupled to a 40 pF capacitor. Further details of the design of a tunnel diode oscillator circuit and its use in a wireless transponder are described in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,873. In brief, the oscillator circuit is excited by an externally-generated electromagnetic field at a first frequency (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), which causes the oscillator circuit to radiate a response field at another frequency (f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Tunnel diodes are particularly well suited for this purpose, because the characteristic I-V curve of a tunnel diode includes a portion in which the diode demonstrates &ldquo;negative&rdquo; resistance, i.e., as the voltage applied across the diode decreases, the current through the diode increases, causing oscillations to occur in the circuit. The oscillation frequency (f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) differs from the normal resonant frequency of the circuit because of the effective capacitance of the tunnel diode. Typically, frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> differs from the excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by about 10%-40%. For example, an excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of 88 MHz may yield a response field having a frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of 120 MHz. The intensity and direction of the response field can be used to &ldquo;home in&rdquo; on the location of tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as described below. Alternatively, other types of re-radiating oscillators may be used for this purpose, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration showing implantation of tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a patient, and its use in guiding a surgical tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Typically, tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises a probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is used, for example, to cut and extract a biopsy sample from breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the location marked by tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises an antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is coupled to excitation and detection circuitry, contained either within tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or in a separate processing unit (not shown in this figure). Antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is driven to radiate RF energy at or near the excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the circuitry in tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This excitation energy causes the tag to radiate a response field at frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is detected by the antenna assembly. Typically, antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> comprises two or more antennas (not shown), spaced around the longitudinal axis of probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The difference between the respective field strengths sensed by the antennas at frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is indicative of the direction and magnitude of the misalignment of the probe axis relative to the location of tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Based on the detected response fields, a display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the handle of tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> guides the surgeon in directing probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> precisely to the location of tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the signals from the antennas are equal, the probe axis is aligned with the tag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for performing a surgical procedure using tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The tag is initially implanted in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a radiologist, at an implant step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This step is typically carried out while imaging the breast to determine the location of a suspicious lesion, so as to place tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within or adjacent to the lesion. A surgeon then brings probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into proximity with breast. Antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> transmits a RF field in the direction of probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, toward breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at a power transmission step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As noted above, the transmitted field is at or near the excitation frequency of the oscillator circuit in tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The oscillation thus engendered in the circuit causes it to radiate a response field, or beacon signal, at a beacon transmission step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receives the beacon signal, at a beacon reception step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the signal is processed to measure its strength and, optionally, its directional characteristics. These characteristics are used in driving display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to give the surgeon a visual indication of how probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> should be directed through the breast tissue in order to reach tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> simply gives a signal strength indication, and the surgeon directs the probe so as to maximize the signal strength. In another embodiment, the response signal is processed to generate a directional signal, typically using multiple antennas in assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as described above. The antenna outputs are processed, using analog and/or digital differential processing circuitry, to drive a pointer or cursor on display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, indicating the direction from probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Optionally, tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also provides an audible indication, such as a tone or sequence of tones, to cue the surgeon as to whether or not the probe is correctly directed to the target in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The surgeon uses the information provided by display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to guide probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> toward tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at a guidance step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are repeated continually until the distal tip of probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> reaches the location of tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at a success step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Successful penetration by the probe tip to the tag location can be determined in a number of different ways. For example, an antenna or other sensor may be incorporated in the probe near its distal tip in order to signal when the probe contacts the tag. Alternatively, each of the multiple antennas in assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be used to find a respective directional vector, pointing from the antenna to the tag location. The crossing point of these vectors indicates the location of the tag. It is thus determined that the probe tip has reached the tag location when the distance from antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the vector crossing point is equal to the known length of probe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At this point, display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> preferably gives an indication of success, such as a change in color or audible signal. The surgeon can then complete the biopsy or other procedure that is warranted. Tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may either be surgically removed as part of this procedure, or it may be left in place for future access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration that shows a partly-cutaway view of an implantable passive tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises, in addition to antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, one or more position-sensing coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Application of electromagnetic fields to coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by external field generators causes currents to flow in these coils. The amplitudes of the currents can be used to determine the position and orientation coordinates of the coils relative to the field generators (as shown below in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Exemplary methods for determining position and orientation of an invasive device using coils such as these are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,199, to Ben-Haim, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/793,371 filed May 14, 1997 (PCT Patent Publication WO 96/05768, to Ben-Haim et al.), whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. Three position-sensing coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be used to provide six-dimensional location and orientation coordinates of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. For applications that do not require full, six-dimensional information, a single position-sensing coil is adequate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are coupled to control circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which senses the currents flowing in the coils for use in determining the coordinates of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Preferably, circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> generates signals in which the current magnitudes are encoded and causes these signals to be transmitted by antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The signals are decoded and processed by an external processing unit to determine the coordinates of the tag. Optionally, tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may also comprise one or more additional sensors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which measure physiological parameters at the site of the tag in the body. Examples of such sensors include temperature sensors, pressure sensors, pH sensors, and other sensors for measuring physical and chemical properties of tissues with which tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in contact. Circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> encodes and transmits these sensor measurements, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an electrical schematic diagram showing circuit elements of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably optimized to receive and transmit high-frequency signals, in the range above 1 MHz. Coil <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, is preferably designed for operation in the range of 1-3 kHz, at which the external field generators generate their electromagnetic fields. Alternatively, other frequency ranges may be used, as dictated by application requirements. According to this embodiment, tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can typically be made about 2-5 mm in length and 2-3 mm in outer diameter. Further aspects of this type of tag are described in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/029,473. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To determine the position of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, electric fields are applied to the area of the patient&apos;s body containing the tag by a number of field generators in different, known positions and/or orientations. Preferably, each of the field generators has its own, distinct operating frequency. Control circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> measures the currents flowing in sensor coil <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the different field frequencies and encodes the measurements in a high-frequency signal transmitted via antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, the different field generators are time-multiplexed, each operating during its own preassigned time slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment pictured in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> comprises a voltage-to-frequency (V/F) converter <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which generates a RF signal whose frequency is proportional to the voltage produced by the sensor coil current flowing across a load. Preferably, the RF signal produced by circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a carrier frequency in the 50-150 MHz range. The RF signal produced in this manner is modulated with a number of different frequency modulation (FM) components that vary over time at the respective frequencies of the fields generated by the field generators. The magnitude of the modulation is proportional to the current components at the different frequencies. A receiver outside the patient&apos;s body demodulates the RF signal to determine the magnitudes of the current components and thereby to calculate the coordinates of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may comprise a sampling circuit and analog/digital (A/D) converter (not shown in the figures), which digitizes the amplitude of the current flowing in sensor coil <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this case, circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> generates a digitally-modulated signal, and RF-modulates the signal for transmission by antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Any suitable method of digital encoding and modulation may be used for this purpose. Other methods of signal processing and modulation will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a system <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for guiding a surgical tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the location of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A power coil <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> generates a high-frequency RF field, preferably in the 2-10 MHz range. This field causes a current to flow in antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is rectified by circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and used to power its internal circuits. Meanwhile, field generator coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> produce electromagnetic fields, preferably in the 1-3 kHz range, which cause currents to flow in sensor coil (or coils) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. These currents have frequency components at the same frequencies as the driving currents flowing through the generator coils. The current components are proportional to the strengths of the components of the respective magnetic fields produced by the generator coils in a direction parallel to the sensor coil axis. Thus, the amplitudes of the currents indicate the position and orientation of coil <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> relative to fixed generator coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Circuitry <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> encodes the current amplitudes from coil <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> into a high-frequency signal, which is transmitted by antenna <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may comprise separate antennas for receiving RF power and for transmitting signals, as described, for example, in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,724. The encoded signal is received by coil <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> or by another receiving antenna, and is conveyed to a processing unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Typically, processing unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> comprises a general-purpose computer, with suitable input circuits and software for processing the position signals received over the air from tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The processing unit computes position and, optionally, orientation coordinates of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and then shows the tag coordinates on a display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Surgical tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> also comprises a position sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, comprising one or more coils similar in form and function to coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The fields produced by field generator coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also cause currents to flow in sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, in response to the position and orientation of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> relative to coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The current signals thus produced are also conveyed to processing unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, either over the air, as in the case of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, or via wire. If sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> transmits the signals over the air, it preferably uses a different carrier frequency from that of tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so that the signals can be easily distinguished one from another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Based on the signals from tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and from sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, processing unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> computes the position and orientation of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> relative to the location of the tag in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A pointer and/or cursor is shown on display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to indicate to the surgeon whether the tool is aimed properly towards its target. Various methods of coordinate display may be used for this purpose, such as a three-dimensional grid mesh, a two-dimensional grid, a two- or-three dimensional polar representation, numerical coordinate readout, or other methods known in the art. Optionally, the positions of the tag and tool are registered, using their measured positions and orientations, with an image of breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as an X-ray, CT or ultrasound image. The image of the breast is shown on display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and icons corresponding to the positions of the tag and the tool are superimposed on the image. Further methods of display that are useful in image-guided surgery are described in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,332,098. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for guiding surgical tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the location of a tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> receives its operating power not from an electromagnetic field (such as that of coil <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>), but from acoustic energy generated by an ultrasound transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. A tag of this sort is shown, for example, in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/029,595. The acoustic energy generated by transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> excites a miniature transducer, such as a piezoelectric crystal, in tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, to generate electrical energy. The electrical energy causes a current to flow in one or more coils in tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, such as coil <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> described above. The currents in the coils in tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> generate electromagnetic fields outside breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which are in this case received by coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (now acting as field receivers, rather than field generators). The amplitudes of the currents flowing in coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at the frequency of the applied acoustic energy are measured to determine the position of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> may be similar in operation to tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, in that sensor coil or coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the tag receive a field generated by coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and then circuitry in the tag transmits a signal indicating the amplitudes of the current components in coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, however, the circuitry in the tag receives power not from coil <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, but rather by rectifying the electrical energy generated by the piezoelectric crystal (or other transducer) in tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in response to the acoustic energy applied by transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The tag may transmit its signal in pulses, rather than continuously, and a capacitor may be used to store energy in tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the intervals between the pulses, so that the transmitted signal is powerful enough to be received outside the body with good signal/noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As in the preceding embodiment, sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is used to determine the position and orientation of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may either receive the fields generated by coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as described above, or it may be driven to generate fields, which are received by coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The position signals generated by tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are received and processed by a combined location pad and display unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. This unit takes the place of the separate processing unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> used in the preceding embodiment. Unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is preferably held by a stable, movable mount (not shown), enabling the surgeon to place the unit in proximity to breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and in a position in which a display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the unit can be viewed conveniently. Field generator coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are built into unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, so that the positions of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are determined relative to the unit. (Coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are seen in the figure in cutaway view, but ordinarily would be contained inside the case of the unit, protected by a non-conductive cover.) Since it is not the absolute positions of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that are of concern, but rather their relative positions and orientations, the surgeon may move unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> during the surgery as required, in order to ensure that the signals from tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are sufficiently strong, that display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is easily visible, and that the unit itself does not interfere with the surgeon&apos;s work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a distance guide <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and an orientation target <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. A mark <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on distance guide <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> indicates how far the tip of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is from the location of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. A cursor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on target <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> indicates the orientation of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> relative to the axis required to reach the location of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. When the cursor is centered on the target, it means that tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is pointing directly toward tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) preferably works on a similar principle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for performing a surgical procedure using system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, including tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and combined location pad and display unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A similar procedure may be carried out, mutatis mutandis, using the elements of system <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the procedure begins with implantation of the appropriate tag at the target location in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at an implant step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The tag is then energized by applying transmitter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to the breast, and driving the transmitter to generate acoustic energy, at an energizing step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is used, coil <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is used to energize the tag with RF power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Energizing the tag causes it to transmit a location signal to unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, at a tag transmission step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At the same time, or in alternation with the tag transmission, sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> conveys a location signal to unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, as well, at a tool transmission step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (or processing unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) receives the location signals and determines the relative coordinates of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, at a coordinate determination step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Based on this determination, the location and orientation of the tool relative to the tag are shown on display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the manner described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The surgeon uses the information presented by display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to guide the distal end of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the location of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, at a probe guidance step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In typical operation, the surgeon holds the tool at a selected starting position and aims it toward tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, using target <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The surgeon then advances the tool into breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, keeping cursor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> centered on target <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are repeated continually until mark <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> indicates that the tool has reached the location of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, at a success step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The biopsy or other desired procedure can then be performed. </paragraph>

Various tags of this sort, which are applicable to the purposes of the present invention, are shown and described in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/029,595. Tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment has the form of a spherical bubble, comprising a shell <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is struck by ultrasound waves generated by acoustic transducers outside the patient&apos;s body. The incident ultrasound waves induce the tag to resonate and to emit a detectable ultrasound echo. If shell <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is spherical (as shown), then the emitted echo is generally isotropic, and triangulation of the echo can yield the location of the target in the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Preferably, shell <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> contains a medium <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and the shell and medium are configured so that tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a nonlinear vibrational response to incident ultrasonic radiation. Ultrasound waves having a frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, emitted by the acoustic generators outside the patient&apos;s body, strike the shell, imparting energy to the shell and/or the contained medium. The shell then emits ultrasound waves at its resonant frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is different from f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The resonant frequency is determined by parameters such as the shell radius, Young modulus and thickness, as is known in the art. Preferably, to generate strong echoes, the design parameters of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are chosen so that f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a multiple of f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration showing a system <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> for guiding surgical tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment also uses the combined location pad and display unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> described above. Multiple ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are applied to breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each transducer in turn is driven to generate a pulse of ultrasonic energy at frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then to detect the echo signal returned by tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, all the transducers may detect the echo returned due to the ultrasonic pulses generated by a single one of the transducers. The time delay between generation of the ultrasonic pulse and receipt of the echo indicates the distance from each of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, the power of the echo signal received by each of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may be used to determine the distances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> To determine the actual location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, however, it is necessary to know the locations of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, a sensor coil <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is attached to each of the transducers. Energizing field generator coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> causes currents to flow in sensor coils <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The amplitudes of these currents, as noted above, depend on the locations and orientations of the sensor coils relative to the field generator coils. Unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> analyzes the currents flowing in sensor coils <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in order to determine the position coordinates of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Based on these coordinates, along with the distances measured by ultrasound reflection from each of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is able to determine the exact location of the tag in a fixed, external frame of reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The location and orientation coordinates of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> relative to unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are determined using sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, as described above, so that the distance and direction from the tool to tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can also be calculated and displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It will be observed that system <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> uses two sets of position measurements to find the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>: location of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> relative to unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> relative to the transducers. This added level of complication is not present in the embodiments described earlier. On the other hand, by comparison with tags <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is extremely simply and inexpensive to fabricate and can be made very small if desired. Typically, tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a diameter less than 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for performing a surgical procedure using system <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, including tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, too, the procedure starts with implantation of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by a radiologist at the site of a suspected lesion in breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at an implant step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Preferably, for this purpose, the material of shell <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is selected so as to be clearly visible using standard imaging techniques. Then, in preparation for surgery, transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are fixed to the skin of breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> around the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at a transducer fixation step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In order to find the relative positions and orientations of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, field generator coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are actuated, and the currents flowing in sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and sensor coils <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are measured, at a RF location step <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, other position sensing techniques may be used for this purpose. For example, optical sensing techniques may be used to find the coordinates of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, since both tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are outside the patient&apos;s body. Ultrasonic position sensing techniques may likewise be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are actuated, and the echoes received by the transducers from tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are measured, at an echo measurement step <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The echoes are used to determine the distance from each of transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, as described above. (The order of steps <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may alternatively be reversed.) Unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> then performs the necessary geometrical calculations and transformations to find the position and orientation of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> relative to tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at a triangulation step <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The distance of the tool from the tag and the orientation of the tool relative to the direct approach axis to the tag are shown on display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, at a display step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The surgeon uses the information presented by display <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to guide the distal end of tool <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at a probe guidance step <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The surgeon advances the tool into breast <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, keeping cursor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> centered on target <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, as described above. Steps <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are repeated continually until mark <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> indicates that the tool has reached the location of tag <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, at a success step <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The biopsy or other desired procedure can then be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiments described above all relate to breast surgery, and particularly to breast biopsy, the devices and methods used in these embodiments may also be adapted to other procedures and to treatment of other body organs. For example, tags such as those described above may be implanted in body tissues to be treated by high-intensity focused radiation. Such techniques are typically used for ablation of tumors and other lesions inside the body. In therapeutic applications of this sort, the radiologist would implant the tag at the location to be treated, and the radiation sources to be used for the treatment would then be aimed at the tag location. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, for instance, if transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> were of a type suitable to be used in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment, they could be oriented and aimed toward the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> using the position signals and display generated by unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration showing the use of tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a bronchoscopy procedure, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed to a suspicious nodule <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, which was discovered during an imaging procedure performed in a lung <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of a patient <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. A bronchoscope <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is used to inspect and, possibly, to biopsy nodule <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. It is also desirable to be able to return easily to the same nodule location for follow-up in subsequent bronchoscopic examinations. A physician <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> operates bronchoscope <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> by grasping and manipulating a handle <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Bronchoscope comprises elements similar to tool <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>: antenna assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (suitably adapted and miniaturized) at the distal end of the bronchoscope, and display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on handle <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. While viewing the display, physician <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> turns a steering knob <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and advances the bronchoscope into lung <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> until it reaches the location of nodule <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Although this embodiment is based on tag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the other RF-based tags described above (such as tag <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) may also be used for this purpose. Tags based on the use of ultrasound, on the other hand, are typically less satisfactory for pulmonary applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a schematic, pictorial illustration showing the use of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in a colonoscopy procedure, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this example, tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is fixed to a polyp <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that was discovered in a colon <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of a patient. Ultrasound transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, but not in this figure) are fixed to the patient&apos;s abdomen, to enable the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be determined, in the manner described above. A colonoscope <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is advanced through colon <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, and its position is tracked by means of sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. As the distal end of the colonoscope approaches the location of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> displays the distance and direction from the colonoscope to the tag. Optionally, an icon indicating the position of tag <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is superimposed on a video image of the interior of colon <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that is formed by an image sensor in the colonoscope and displayed on a suitable video display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiments described above are directed to certain specific medical and surgical procedures in particular body organs, other areas of application of the tags, ancillary equipment and methods of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The principles of the present invention may similarly be applied to other types of surgery, including particularly minimally-invasive surgery, as well as endoscopic and non-invasive treatment and diagnostic modalities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> It will thus be appreciated that the preferred embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove, as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description and which are not disclosed in the prior art. </paragraph>
