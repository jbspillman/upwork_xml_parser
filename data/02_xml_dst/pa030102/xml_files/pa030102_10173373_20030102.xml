</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to methods of fabricating a integrated circuit devices including gate insulating layers and related devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> High integration of semiconductor memory devices such as DRAM devices has resulted in a reduction in the size of transistors. As the length of a gate decreases, the thickness of a gate insulating layer (such as a gate oxide layer) may be reduced to increase the operational speed of a semiconductor device. However, a decrease in the thickness of the gate insulating layer may also increase a frequency of breakdowns because decreasing the thickness of the gate insulating layer generally results in a lower breakdown voltage. In addition, different areas of a memory device may have varying performance requirements. Therefore, a desired thickness of a gate insulating layer may vary from point to point on a semiconductor device based on desired performance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, if gate insulating layers in a cell array region and a peripheral circuit region have different thicknesses, it may be possible to improve operational features and reliability of the device. Typically, performance and reliability can be improved if the cell array region has a gate insulating layer with a greater thickness than the peripheral circuit region. More specifically, because of advances in highly integrated semiconductor devices such as DRAM devices, the area of the cell array region of such devices has increased in size compared to the peripheral circuit region. If all of the gate insulating layers formed on a chip have the same thickness, a breakdown may occur first in a gate insulating layer positioned on the cell array region and the semiconductor device may lose reliability or fail to operate at all. This problem may be reduced by increasing thicknesses of the gate insulating layers formed on the cell array region in comparison to gate insulating layers formed on the peripheral circuit region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views illustrating a semiconductor device having gate oxide layers of different thicknesses fabricated according to a conventional method. In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</cross-reference>, the gate oxide layer formed on a left region TK is thicker compared to the gate oxide layer formed on a right region TI. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, e.g. a silicon substrate, having a trench <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is first oxidized to obtain a first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be about 10 nm thick. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed on a portion of the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the TK region. A portion of the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is then etched from the TI region. As a result, the thickness of the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> remaining on the TI region is thinner compared to that on the TK region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is removed from the TK region as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. The first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is etched such that the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is removed from the TI region. Because the photoresist pattern has been removed, the portion of the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the TK region is also etched and the thickness of the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the TK region is reduced. Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is oxidized again to form a second gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the TI. During this oxidation step, the thickness of the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the TK region is increased. Through the above method, the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the TK region can have a thickness greater than that of the second gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the TI region. The resulting semiconductor device can thus have gate oxide layers with different thicknesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> remaining on the TK region may, however, be contaminated when the first gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is selectively removed from the TI region (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference>). This contamination may degrade the operational characteristics of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuit devices according to embodiments of the present invention may include a semiconductor substrate having first and second spaced apart source/drain regions at a surface thereof.

A source/drain region between separated portions of the gate patterns can be formed near on the surface of the semiconductor substrate. An interlayer insulating film pattern, which fills a gap between separated portions of the gate pattern, can be formed. The interlayer insulating film having a contact hole for exposing the semiconductor substrate may be formed in the cell array region. Finally, a gate oxide layer in the exposed cell array region whose thickness is greater than that of the gate oxide layer formed in the peripheral circuit region may be formed through oxygen diffusion by oxidizing the semiconductor substrate on the exposed cell array region. At this time, the thickness of the gate oxide layer in the cell array region changes depending on the extent of oxidation when the semiconductor substrate is oxidized. Also, the semiconductor substrate in the exposed cell array region may be oxidized through a wet oxidation or dry oxidation method. A contact pad for filling the contact hole may be formed.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the relative sizes of elements may be exaggerated for clarity. When a layer is described as being formed on another layer or a semiconductor substrate, the layer may be formed directly on the other layer or semiconductor substrate, or other layers may be interposed therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &ldquo;directly on&rdquo; another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 12</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views illustrating steps of fabricating integrated circuit devices according to embodiments of the present invention. For ease of discussion, the gate insulating layer is described as a silicon oxide layer. Other gate insulating materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> trench oxide layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is formed in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, e.g., p-type silicon substrate, to define two isolated regions. The isolated regions defined by the trench oxide layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are a cell array (CA) region and a peripheral circuit (PA) region. A shallow trench isolation (STI) method may be used to form the isolated regions in the present embodiment. Other methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used to isolate the cell array region and the peripheral circuit region. The portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that includes the trench oxide layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be an inactive region while remaining portions of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be active regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a gate insulating layer such as a gate oxide layer is formed. As shown, a first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for a gate oxide film can be formed on the entire semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be formed after well-ion implantation for forming a well and field-ion implantation and channel-ion implantation for forming a channel. The first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be formed of a thermal oxide film. The first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be formed such that its thickness is a thickness desired for a gate oxide layer in the PA region. For example, the first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may have a thickness in a range of about 20 to about 60 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, a first conductive layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for a gate electrode is formed on the first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. For example, the first conductive layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> include an impurity-doped polysilicon film having a thickness of between about 500 and about 1000 &angst; and a metal silicide film having a thickness of between about 500 and about 1000 &angst;. Then, a first insulating film <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> can be formed on the first conductive layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The first insulating film <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> may have a thickness of between about 1000 and about 2000 &angst;. The first insulating film <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a material with etching selectivity with respect to the first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, e.g., a silicon nitride film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, the first conductive layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the first silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are patterned, for example, through a photolithography process, to form a gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and a gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a substantially uniform thickness. The gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> can include a first insulating film pattern <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thereafter, N-type impurities can be ion-implanted into the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to form a lightly doped drain (LDD). As a result, a first impurity region <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> can be formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> while being aligned with respect to the sidewalls of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The first impurity region <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> includes first and second spaced apart source/drain regions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the CA region and third and fourth spaced apart source/drain regions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the PA region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> spacer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is formed along both sidewalls of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The spacer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be obtained by forming an insulating film of thickness of about 300 &angst; to about 1000 &angst; on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having the gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and anisotropically etching the insulating film. At this time, the insulating film for the spacer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be formed of a material having high etching selectivity with respect to the silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, e.g., a silicon nitride film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Next, if necessary, a thermal oxide layer (not shown) may be formed to a thickness of about 50 &angst; to about 100 &angst; by thermally oxidizing the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> so that silicon damaged during the anisotropic etching of the insulating film is removed from the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Further, N-type impurities can be implanted into the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> on which the gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the spacer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are formed. As a result, a second impurity region <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> while being aligned with reference to the spacer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Finally, an LDD-type source/drain region <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> composed of the first and second impurity regions <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> masking film, depicted as second insulating film <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, can be formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Any masking material may be used for second insulating film <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The second insulating film <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> may be formed to a thickness of about 100 &angst; on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having the gate pattern <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the gate spacer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The second insulating film <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a material having high etching selectivity with respect to the silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, e.g., a silicon nitride film. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 13</cross-reference>, portions of the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) formed on the CA region are removed, for example, by selective etching using a photolithography process. The resulting interlayer insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and second insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provide a masking film pattern to expose the CA region while the interlayer insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and second insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are maintained on the PA region.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The CA region of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is exposed and the PA region is covered by the interlayer insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and second insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for two reasons. First, a contact pad may be formed in contact hole <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in order that a bit line (or storage node) can easily electrically contact the impurity region on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the reference numerals <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> denote a contact hole, a gate line and an active region, respectively. The contact hole <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> may preferably be formed to be larger than the active region <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> by between about 20 to about 40 nm. Second, a thickness of portions of the silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be increased, as described in greater detail herein, to form gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> while a relatively uniform thickness of the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> including the contact hole <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, which exposes the CA region may be thermally oxidized, for example, through a wet-oxidation or dry-oxidation method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The PA region is covered by a masking film, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> as the interlayer insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and second insulating layer pattern <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A second silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> can be formed having a thickness of between about 30 &angst; and about 100 &angst; on the CA region of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Thus, the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> is oxygen-diffused and changed into the second silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The second silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> has a &ldquo;bird&apos;s beak&rdquo; shape.

Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the second silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> on the CA region is anisotropically etched to form a gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of which thickness is different from that of the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the PA region. The thickness of the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the CA region varies depending on the extent of oxidation of the exposed CA region.
