<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a device and a method of editing video projects, and more particularly, to a video editing device and method for editing video projects concerned with the character of editing methods of timeline and storyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the past, film-clip persons must use many projectors and clipping facilities to edit several tapes into a video program. Due to the improvement of modem technology, film-clip persons are able to record tape into a memory device of a computer. And by directly using a digital camcorder to record digital film, they can make a video program via a computer video editing software. Thus, it is more convenient and can achieve better effect of film by using computers instead of hardware facilities to edit video programs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Among the present editing software, there is a method of storyboard to edit video programs. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. An editing user arranges order of a video clip <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a video clip <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a video clip <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and a video clip <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the user inserts a transition effect <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> between the video clip <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the video clip <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and inserts a transition effect <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> between the video clip <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the video clip <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> separately. And the transition effect is for showing special transition effect when there happens transition between two video clips. The effect, for example, is achieved by using the method of overlapping two video clips, changing films from top to down and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, there is a disadvantage to edit video programs by the method of storyboard: only two tracks of video clip and one transition effect can be edited. There is no multi-track editing. The system of editing video program, the method of displaying timeline, can ameliorate the above problem. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It shows the illustration of editing scenes of video programs by the method of timeline. A screen <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> consists of a timeline <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and includes multiple tracks: a video track VA, a transition track F/X, a video track VB, an overlay track V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an overlay track V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and so on. These tacks are for performing video clips, transition effects, and video clips with an overlay option (such as title information, footnotes, and so on). And the direction of these tracks is along the direction of timeline <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. General speaking, the transition effect of video clips is edited on the transition track F/X. At <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is known that users add a video clip <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, a video clip <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a video clip with an overlay option <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, a video clip with an overlay option <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, a video clip with an overlay option <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and a transition effect <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, into the above mentioned tracks and proceed to edit these clips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As the above mention, multi-track editing can be achieved by editing video programs with the method of timeline. And that causes video program full of more variable effects. However, there is a disadvantage within this method. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, since the length of a video clip <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is 40 minutes, a transition effect <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and a video clip with an overlay option <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> will be shrunk and users cannot easily select and edit them by a mouse when displaying all videos in a full screen. At this moment, users have to decrease the unit of the timeline <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in order to proceed clicking and selecting editing shorter length of video clips, transition effects, or video clips with an overlay option. Therefore, it is known that a user needs to often change the unit of a timeline <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to edit video programs when there is a long-time video clip in a video program. It is very inconvenient for a user. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a video editing device and method for editing a video project for users to proceed multi-track video program editing. When the length of video clips or transition effect differs widely, users can edit the shorter transition effects or video clips without the need to change the unit of timeline often. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide a video editing method and device for editing a video project. The video project includes a plurality of video clips and transition effects allocated between adjacent video clips. The invention firstly provides a timeline and multiple tracks along the timeline. Then video clips and transition effects are inserted into the corresponding tracks. Next, the timeline is cut into a plurality of segments so that each of the segments corresponds to a distinguishable combination of the video clips and the transition effects. Next, for each of the segments, the invention displays each of the tracks with a limited number of thumbnails derived from the corresponding video clips, or with an icon indicating the corresponding transition effect.</paragraph>

And the storage unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is for storing all video clips and transition effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, which connects in pair with the display unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the storage unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, is for executing the video editing method for editing a video project of the preferred embodiment of the invention. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a flowchart of the video editing method for editing a video project according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an illustration of editing a video project on a screen of the display unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> by the method of this invention. The method of this invention firstly starts at Step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The method provides a timeline <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and a plurality of tracks along the timeline <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> on the screen <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the display unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. And the tracks includes a video track VA, a video track, F/X, a transition track VB, an overlay track V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an overlay track V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and so on. These tracks are for storing video clips and transition effects in order to proceed editing, and their direction is along the direction of the timeline <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. Next, the method proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is for users to insert video clips and transition effects into the corresponding tracks on the screen <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. The video clip <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, video clip <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, video clip <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>, and transition effects <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> are separately inserted into the video track VA, the video track VB, the overlay track V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the transition track F/X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, according to the starting time and ending time of the video clips and transition effects, the timeline <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> is cut into multiple segments so that each of the segments corresponds to a distinguishable combination of the video clips and the transition effect. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> at the same time. According to the starting time and ending time of the video clips and transition effect <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, the timeline <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> is split into five segments: Segment <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, Segment <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, Segment <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, Segment <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, and Segment <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>. And when the video project starts to be played, within the interval of Segment <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> only plays the video clip <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. And within the interval of Segment <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> simultaneously plays the video clip <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, the transition effect <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, and the video clip <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. Then within the interval of Segment <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> only plays the video clip <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, and within the interval of Segment <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> simultaneously plays the video clip <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, and the video clip <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>. Finally, , the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> plays the video clip <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> within the interval of Segment <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, at Step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, for each of the segments, a limited number of thumbnails are derived from the corresponding video clip to symbolize the part of the video clip on the corresponding track and the transition effect <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> is displayed with an icon. And the limited number of thumbnails could be the limited number of frames selected from the corresponding video clip. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates, one thumbnail derived from a video clip is used to symbolize part of the corresponding video clip in each segment. In addition, multiple thumbnails could be used to symbolize part of video clips in each segment. For example, three thumbnails are used to symbolize but the invention is not limited thereto. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another illustration of editing a video project according to the method of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the clipping part of the video clip <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> is represented as three thumbnails in Segment <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>. After Step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, if the user does not proceed editing, the processing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> will finish the method; otherwise the method proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>, the video clips and transition effects on the screen <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> could be modified; and then the method goes back to Step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. At Step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>, users can add, delete, or edit a video clip or transition effect. Wherein, the editing of video clips or transition effects means to change the track or location of video clips or transition effects on the Screen <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. That is to change the playing sequence or time of video clips or transition effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The invention, which is a video editing device and method for editing a video project revealed by the above embodiments, includes the following advantages: </paragraph>
