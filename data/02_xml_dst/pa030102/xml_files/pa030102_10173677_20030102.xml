<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawings used for this description typically illustrate major characteristic parts to facilitate understanding of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, and in particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes an AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which receives an input address signal IAS and a select signal S, and a logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which receives an output of the AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has two input terminals. One of the input terminals is electrically connected to an address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the other one is electrically connected to a select signal line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> transfers the input address signal IAS outputted from a CPU to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as an output address signal OAS, when the select signal S is an active state. The logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is consisted of, for example, a write resister and a read resister. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a signal timing chart of the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the input address signal IAS, the select signal S and the output address signal OAS. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when an address of the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> receives the input address signal IAS having an address &ldquo;3&rdquo; which is the same as the address &ldquo;3&rdquo; of the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and outputs the output address signal OAS having an address &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, when the select signal S is an active state. At that time, a voltage of the output address signal OAS having the address &ldquo;3&rdquo; is, for example, 5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> outputs the output address signal OAS having an address &ldquo;0&rdquo; when the select signal is an inactive state. The output address signal OAS having the address &ldquo;0&rdquo; indicates, for example, that a voltage of all signal lines of the address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is 0V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the output address signal OAS which is applied to the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be kept at 0V when the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a non-accessed state, the application of a voltage to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be inhibited. Therefore, a power consumption of the non-accessed peripheral circuit can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, and in particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> includes an latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which receives an input address signal IAS and receives a select signal S as a gate signal, and a logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which receives an output of the latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a data input terminal D and a gate terminal G. The data input terminal D is electrically connected to an address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the gate terminal G is electrically connected to a select signal line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> receives and holds an address of the input address signal IAS outputted from a CPU when the select signal S is an active state, and outputs the address to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as an output address signal OAS. The logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is consisted of, for example, a write resister and a read resister. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a signal timing chart of the semiconductor integrated circuit according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the first preferred embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the input address signal IAS, the select signal S and the output address signal OAS. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the address of the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> receives and holds the input address signal IAS having the address &ldquo;3&rdquo; which is the same as the address &ldquo;3&rdquo; of the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and continues to output the output address signal OAS having the address &ldquo;3&rdquo; to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, after when the select signal S changes an active state. At that time, a voltage of the output address signal OAS having the address &ldquo;3&rdquo; is, for example, 5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> outputs the output address signal OAS having an address &ldquo;0&rdquo; when the select signal is an inactive state. The output address signal OAS having the address &ldquo;0&rdquo; indicates, for example, that a voltage of all signal lines of the address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is 0V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the output address signal OAS which is applied to the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be held to 0V when the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is in a non-accessed state, the application of a voltage to the logic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be inhibited. Therefore, power consumption of the non-accessed peripheral circuit can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the third preferred embodiment, gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed externally of peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, while the gate (e.g., the AND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the latch circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is formed in the peripheral circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, in the first and second preferred embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from a bridge circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> branches off into five branch address buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the five branch buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are electrically connected to the five peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. The gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed at locations just after the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is branched off into the branch address buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Each branch address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes sub-buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The sub-bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is longer than the sub-bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Select signals S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are applied to the gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. As a result, an opened and closed state of the gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are controlled in accordance with states (active and inactive) of the select signals S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this way, an address signal on the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not communicated to the branch address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to a non-accessed peripheral circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to the third preferred embodiment of the present invention, since a voltage of all signal lines of the branch address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are not communicated with the address signal on the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is held to 0V, current does not flow to these signal lines. Therefore, a power consumption of the non-accessed peripheral circuits can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed externally of peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed in a main bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is, for example, an AND gate or a latch circuit, and transfer an address signal when an output of a select circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is an active state. The select circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is, for example, an OR gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from a bridge circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> branches off into five branch address buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the five branch buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are electrically connected to the five peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. The gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed and located just after the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is branched off into the branch address buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The branch address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes sub-buses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The sub-bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is longer than the sub-bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Select signals S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are applied to the gates G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. Also, select signals S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are applied to the select circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The select circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> simply selects and outputs the select signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the peripheral circuit P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are located after the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> transfers the address signal when one of the peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are accessed. However, the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> does not transfer the address signal when the peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are accessed. Therefore, a voltage of all signal lines of the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>locating at an output side of the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fixed at 0V. The gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be controlled by an exclusive decode signal in place of the output of the select circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the voltage of all signal lines of the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>located at the output side of the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fixed to 0V when the peripheral circuits P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> located at outside of the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are non-accessed, a useless current does not flow to the all signal lines of the main address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>located at the output side of the gate G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a power consumption of the non-accessed peripheral circuits can be reduced. </paragraph>
