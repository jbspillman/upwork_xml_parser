<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a device for mounting an electrical component on a printed circuit card. The invention particularly applies to integrated circuits whose contact with the connection pads of the printed circuit card is produced by pressure. An integrated circuit provided with a plurality of contact terminals constituting a matrix of flat leads known as an LGA (Land Grid Array) is well adapted to the implementation of the invention, and for that reason will be used as an example to illustrate the invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, an integrated circuit is placed in a package comprising contact terminals. Throughout the description below, the expression &ldquo;LGA integrated circuit&rdquo; will be used to designate both an LGA integrated circuit and a circuit placed in a package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, the LGA integrated circuit has two sides, one active and the other inactive. The active side comprises the contact terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, connecting the LGA integrated circuit to the printed circuit card requires stacking a certain number of elements. An insert comprising flexible electric contacts is placed between the LGA integrated circuit and the printed circuit card in order to connect them electrically. Pressure must be exerted on this system in order to produce a good electrical contact. This is done by means of a press plate applied to the non-active side of the LGA integrated circuit. The device is completed by a heat sink that serves to dissipate heat. A variant consists of forming the press plate and the heat sink in one piece. Generally, a thermal joint is inserted between the LGA integrated circuit and the heat sink for a better transfer of energy to the heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The pressure is applied, for example, by springs pressing on the plate or the plate/heat sink. These springs are generally guided by standoffs attached to the integrated circuit either by inserts or by nuts provided in the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A first problem raised by this technique is that the current systems do not make it possible to mount integrated circuits, particularly integrated circuits whose electrical contact with the printed circuit card is produced by pressure, on two opposite side of the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another problem is that the inserts or nuts take up a considerable amount of space on the printed circuit card. This constitutes a limitation on the component density. The space occupied by these nuts on the printed circuit card is unacceptable in a world where miniaturization is of utmost importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the inserts or nuts deform the card in places. The stress produced can cause the traces located near the inserts or nuts to break. It is therefore necessary to limit the trace width, and the routing density is consequently reduced. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A first object of the invention is to allow LGA integrated circuits to be mounted on both sides of the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A second object is to use mounting means whose base does not deform the printed circuit card and takes up as little space as possible, thereby permitting a higher routing density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A third object of the invention is to retain the ease with which the integrated circuit is mounted on the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A fourth object is to reduce the financial and time cost of this type of implementation as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To this end, the subject of the invention is a device for mounting at least two electrical components on a printed circuit card, the card comprising connection pads on both of its sides, characterized in that the card is traversed by holes for receiving mounting means that extend through the printed circuit card in order to mount the electrical components on opposite sides of the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another subject of the invention is the tool for mounting or removing an electrical component mounted on a printed circuit card, as defined in the mounting device according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises means for exerting pressure on a first electrical component mounted on a first side of the printed circuit card, in order to mount or remove a second electrical component on the opposite side of the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention will be more clearly understood by reading the following description, given as an example and written in reference to the attached drawings. </paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In order to simplify the description, the same elements in the drawings have the same references. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exploded view in partial perspective illustrating an assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> showing the elements to be stacked on a printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The printed circuit card includes connection pads (not represented in the figures) on both of its sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated, an assembly A on one side of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of stacking several elements. The elements to be stacked are, in particular: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> an insert <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A that includes flexible electrical contacts on both sides is inserted between the LGA integrated circuit and the printed circuit card in order to connect them electrically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> the LGA integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A comprising an active surface, i.e., a surface provided with input-output contact terminals. This active side is in contact with the insert <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> a heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A capable of dissipating the energy produced by the LGA integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is placed on the non-active surface of the LGA integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> a thermal joint <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A inserted between the non-active surface of the LGA integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and the heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A so as to constitute a thermal link between these two elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Naturally, this assembly constitutes only one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, the heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A is provided with notches <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A that can freely receive standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> capable of sandwiching together all of the elements mentioned above so as to connect the contact terminals of the LGA integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A with the electrical contacts of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The problem, as mentioned above, is that there are no means that make it possible to mount integrated circuits on two opposite sides of the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> One solution consists, for example, of using mounting means that extend through holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided in the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to mount integrated circuits <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B on opposite sides of the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The mounting of the various elements to be stacked is symmetrical with respect to the printed circuit card. The assembly B of the second integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B consists of stacking the same elements as before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Throughout the description below, each element of the same type in the second assembly will be referenced with the same number as the same element located in a symmetrical position relative to the printed circuit card in the first assembly described above. A letter A or B will be used to distinguish the assembly in which the element is stacked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, part of the mounting means are standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The standoffs extend through holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on each side of the printed circuit card. Each standoff is shared by two integrated circuits <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B disposed on two opposite sides of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and has the characteristic of not being attached to the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated, there are four standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Naturally, there could be any number of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each standoff includes a threaded part on each of its ends capable of receiving a respective screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B. Naturally, the use of such standoffs merely constitutes a preferred embodiment of the invention, and other mounting means that do not use screws are entirely possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, in order to avoid any rotational movement of the standoffs during mounting or removal, the solution consists of using the standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in combination with a plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B on each side of the printed circuit card. This plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B is equipped with holes for the insertion of the standoffs. The function of the holes is specifically to prevent any rotational movement of the standoffs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, the cross section of the holes and the standoffs is hexagonal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a view in perspective of a standoff showing its hexagonal cross section. Naturally, this example is not in any way limiting and any other cross section that prevents a rotational movement of the standoffs is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an electrical insulant <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B is inserted between each plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B and the respective integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. The insulant <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A include respective openings <highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight> capable of allowing contact between the circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and the respective heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B. A thermal joint <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A covers the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A itself for better dissipation of the heat toward the heat sink part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, each plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B is not only a means for rotationally locking the standoffs, but also exerts uniform pressure on the assembly during mounting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B is located in the stack between the heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B and the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Naturally, the plate could be replaced by any other means that ensures both the rotational locking of the standoffs and a uniform pressure during mounting or removal. For example, another variant consists of equipping the base of each heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B with holes having the same function as a plate. The holes simultaneously ensure the rotational locking of the standoffs and the base of the heat sink ensures uniform pressure during mounting or removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The force of the pressure to be exerted on each assembly A and B should be calibrated and brought to bear with great care. One solution consists of equipping each standoff with springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A) for assembly A and springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B) for assembly B in order to apply a force F required to establish electrical contact between each integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the example illustrated, the springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A) of assembly A and springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B) of assembly B press against the respective plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, the standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are equipped with springs with the same stiffness coefficient K in order to exert a uniform pressure. During the screwing process, the head of each screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B compresses the respective spring, possibly via a washer, in order to drive the respective integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B in its movement, so as to connect it to the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The unscrewing of each screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B also has the effect of decompressing the respective spring (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A) and (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B) so as to disconnect the respective integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B from the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, the chosen length of the screw is such that once the spring is decompressed, the respective screw remains engaged in the threading of the respective standoff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A) and (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B) do not press against the heat sinks since the necessary pressure applied in order to ensure good electrical contact with the contacts is different from the pressure required for good thermal contact between an integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and the respective heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B. One solution consists of joining these two components (heat sink and plate), for example by means of at least one respective twist clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>B. A twist clip is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The function of a twist clip is to apply a force that is independent of the pressure force F to be applied for the electrical contacts. This constitutes a means for making the different pressure forces to be applied independent of one another. The two ends of each twist clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>B press on a support surface of the respective heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B and the body presses on an opposing support surface of the plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> represents a top view of the assembly A. In this figure, we can see the heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, the notches <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A cut into the heat sink, which are wider than the standoffs and the springs, the heads of the screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A, the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, and the twist clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A that sandwiches the heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As a precaution, the integrated circuits <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are mounted one after the other. The mounting of the first integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is done by means of a chock that replaces the second assembly, which has not yet been mounted. This chock is representative of the thickness of an assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> After the first integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A has been mounted, the chock is removed. The standoffs being capable of moving in a direction perpendicular to the printed circuit card, the mounting of the second integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B to the other side of the printed circuit card is done by means of a tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a view of an exemplary embodiment of such a tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, this tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is a parallelepipedic package, one of whose two opposite sides is open. The solid side is constituted by a plate that support four shafts <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each shaft being surrounded by a respective spring, two of which are visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, i</cross-reference>.e. the springs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, with a stiffness coefficient K&prime; less than or equal to the stiffness coefficient K of the springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A) and (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B). Each shaft guides the respective spring in its movement and has a length shorter than that of a spring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> During the mounting, or removal followed by a remounting, of this second integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, the package is placed, for example, on a horizontal support, the shafts <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> being directed upward. The printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed on this package in order to insert the assembly A created into the package, the axes of the standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> coinciding with the axes of the shafts <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is attached to the printed circuit card for better handling. The method of attachment is arbitrary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> springs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> come into contact with the heads of the screws (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A) of the assembly A. Inside the package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, each spring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> exerts a force that compensates for the weight of this assembly, thereby preventing any translational movement of the standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The stack is symmetrical on each side of the printed circuit card. During the mounting of the assembly B, the standoffs being rotationally and translationally locked, the screwing or unscrewing is done without any problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Let&apos;s assume that the assembly A is inside the package in the same position as described above and that the assembly B is fully assembled. If it is necessary to remove the assembly B, the screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B are removed. During the removal of the screws from the assembly B, even though the springs of the assembly B are decompressed, the package itself maintains enough pressure on the springs of the assembly A to ensure good electrical contact between the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The springs of the package make it possible to decompress the springs (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A) and (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B) on both sides of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The unscrewing, for example, of the screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B on one side of the printed circuit card decompresses the respective springs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B of the assembly B as well as the springs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A of the assembly A. The springs of the package therefore ensure the equality of the pressure on both sides of the printed circuit card for a certain amount of time. Preferably, the stiffness coefficient of the springs of the package is chosen so that when the forces cancel each other out and an equilibrium is reached, there is sufficient electrical contact with the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The result of the preceding operations produces the assembly visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which represents the completed assembly. </paragraph>

It is noted that the direction in which these steps are performed is entirely arbitrary. The direction of execution chosen is the one that seems most appropriate and easiest for one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Let&apos;s assume that the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A will be mounted first, followed by the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>

This chock is equivalent in size to a plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, but with a thickness representative of the thickness of an assembly. The springs are placed around the standoffs and the chock is pressed against the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The thermal joint <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A is put into place. </paragraph>

</section>

During the removal of the chock, the springs of the package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> exert a force that compensates for the weight of the assembly A inside the package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and thus prevents the standoffs and the assembly A from moving in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the printed circuit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> All that remains is to mount the second integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B onto the side of the printed circuit card from which the standoffs extend and to perform the mounting described according to steps E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through E<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Step F3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> All of the stacked elements of the assembly B (heat sink, plate, insert, etc.) are successively removed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Step F4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The next step consists of remounting the second integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B to the side of the printed circuit card from which the standoffs extend and performing the mounting described according to steps E2 through E8 again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In general, the invention relates to a device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for mounting at least two electrical components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B on a printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the card comprising connection pads on both of its sides, characterized in that the card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is traversed by holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for receiving mounting means that extend through the printed circuit card in order to mount the electrical components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B on opposite sides of the card. We have seen that the mounting means exert equal pressure on both sides of the printed circuit card (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, the mounting means are standoffs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, each standoff comprising on both of its ends a threaded part capable of receiving a screw for the electrical components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B on opposite sides of the printed circuit card. We have seen that the use of such standoffs merely constitutes a preferred embodiment of the invention, and that other mounting means that do not use screws are entirely possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> mount being symmetrical, and the mounting being performed by means of screws, it is necessary to prevent any rotational movement of the standoffs during the screwing or unscrewing operation. One possible solution consists of using a plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on each side of the printed circuit card, said plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> including notches traversed by the standoffs, the shape of the holes and the standoffs preventing any rotational movement of the standoffs for mounting and removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> We have also seen that the electrical connection must be produced with great precision. In our exemplary embodiment, we have chosen to use, on each side of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, springs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B inserted between the head of each respective screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B and the respective plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, one of the ends of the spring pressing against the respective plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B. Preferably, on each side of the printed circuit card, each standoff <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is equipped with a spring with the same stiffness coefficient in order to exert a uniform pressure capable of establishing electrical contact between each electrical component <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> We have also seen that various pressure forces must be applied to certain elements of an assembly. In our example, on each side of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B is mounted on the respective plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, and a twist clip <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B connects the respective heat sink <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B and plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B so as to exert on this assembly a pressure force independent of the pressure force produced by the springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> We have also seen that the present invention is very well adapted to integrated circuits whose electrical contact with the printed circuit card is produced by pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The mounting or removal of the assemblies requires the use of a particular tool. This tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> comprises means for exerting pressure on a first electrical component <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A mounted on a first side of the printed circuit card, in order to mount or remove a second electrical component <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B on the opposite side of the printed circuit card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In our exemplary embodiment, the means for exerting pressure are springs (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) whose axis coincides with the axis of the standoffs (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Hence, it is clear that the present invention offers many advantages. The device of the invention makes it possible to mount integrated circuits on two opposite sides of the printed circuit card, while allowing independent mounting and removal of each of the two integrated circuits, thanks to the tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The passage of the standoffs through the printed circuit card avoids having to use nuts or inserts. Thus, the areas that are off-limits to routing are limited to the area near the hole. Furthermore, it is clear that the combined use of the standoffs and a plate makes it possible to apply the pressure required for good symmetric electrical contact on both sides of the printed circuit card during the mounting and removal operations </paragraph>
