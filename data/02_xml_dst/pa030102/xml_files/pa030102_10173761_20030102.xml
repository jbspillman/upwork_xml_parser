<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Up to date, the importance of ions is recognized in various fields such as health fields, pollution fields and foodstuff fields as well as medical fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many devices, devices and tools having ion generator or ion generating function to generate negative ions are used in home, offices, plants, etc. The invention relates to air ion measuring devices, which are compact in construction and capable of accurately measuring the quantities of positive and negative ions contained in air in the above circumstances readily permitting the recognition of the results of measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shows a prior art ion measuring device. The device comprises an ion detector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which has such a construction that it includes a cylindrical repelling electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provided on the inner surface of an air passage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> formed in a cylindrical case <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for withdrawing air formed in one end portion and exhausting the withdrawn air from the other end portion and a charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> disposed at the center of the air passage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As an alternative construction, the ion detector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a pair of flat repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> disposed mid way between the repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> designates posts for holding the charge collector electrodes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> designates an air withdrawal fun, which is disposed in the other end portion of the air passage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> opposing the air inlet in the afore-mentioned end portion in such orientation as to withdraw air in the same direction as the air passage direction. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> designates a partitioning member, which is disposed at the outlet of the ion detector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and has a plurality of pores <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for adjusting the air passage rate. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> designates an air fitting, which constitutes a casing fitted on the repelling electrode or electrodes of the ion detector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provided on the surface of the air passage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and also on an air passage portion extending from the outlet of the ion detector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the air withdrawal fun <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For measuring, for instance, negative ions in air with the above construction, air is passed through the air passage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by driving the air withdrawal fun <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with the repelling electrode or electrodes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> held negatively charged. In this way, negative ions in air passing by the repelling electrode or electrodes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are repelled to be more readily collected on the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, while positive ions are attracted to and neutralized by the negatively charged repelling electrode or electrodes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The charge collected on the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is converted to voltage and measured. The measurement of positive ions may be made in like principles by positively charging the repelling electrode or electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the prior art air ion measuring device having the above construction, however, the charge collector electrode is supported in a hanged state in the par passage at the center of the cylindrical repelling electrode or mid way between the flat repelling electrodes. Inevitably, the thickness of the ion detector is correspondingly increased, and this dictates size increase of the measuring device itself. In addition, the number of components is increased by parts for holding the charge collector electrode, thus correspondingly dictating many steps of operation and much labor in manufacture. Furthermore, the structure itself constitutes a cause of cleaning difficult. Furthermore, since the air withdrawal fun is oriented such as to withdraw air in the same direction as the air passage direction, it also constitutes a cause of thickness increase of the device itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the disposition of the charge collector electrode as noted above does not only lead to part number increase but also provide resistance offered to the air passage and cause disturbance thereof, which is undesired from the standpoint of accurate ion quantity measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the partitioning member for air passage rate adjustment, which is provided at the outlet of the ion detector, causes disturbance of air passage and is thus again undesired from the standpoint of accurate ion quantity measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Still further, none of prior art portable air ion measuring devices could provide simultaneous display or graphic display of positive and negative ions. Also, none of prior air ion measuring devices could display relative humidity, temperature and atmospheric air pressure which may serve as important parameters for the quantity of air ions generated or could display date, time, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention has an object of providing an air ion measuring device, which can solve all the above problems inherent in the prior art, can hold the air passage rate at ion detector as constant as possible to improve the reliability of the air ion measurement while permitting reduction of its size and thickness and reduction of the ion detector parts cost, permits ready cleaning of the ion detector and is excellent in air ion data display with satisfactory coping with static electricity and good visual recognition property. According to the invention, this object is attained by an ion detector structure, which is obtained by an air passage, through which air is withdrawn from one end portion and exhausted from the other end portion, a charge collector electrode and repelling electrodes disposed in the neighborhood thereof, these electrodes being disposed on one side surface of the air passage, and a repelling electrode disposed on the other side surface of the air passage.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shows the internal construction of an air ion measuring device according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to the Figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> designates the body of the air ion measuring device according to the invention. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> designates a cylindrical case. In this embodiment, the cylindrical case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an angular cylindrical case, which defines an air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, through which air is withdrawn from an end portion and exhausted from the other end portion. On a portion of the surface of the air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are disposed a charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> near the opposite ends of the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A further repelling electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed on a surface portion opposing the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The air passage and the electrodes noted above constitute an ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> designates an air withdrawal fun, which is disposed on the other end portion of the air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for withdrawing air from one end portion of the air passage and exhausting the withdrawn air from the other end portion. According to the invention, the fun is disposed laterally with respect to the air withdrawal direction, that is, it is the same orientation as the air passage direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The outer surface of the ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the cylindrical case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is constituted by the resin material constituting the cylindrical case. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having such a construction has a lid portion which can be opened and closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a structure having flat side surfaces free from raised and recessed portions for suppressing air passage disturbance and reducing measurement data fluctuations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a different embodiment. In the Figure, reference numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> designates an air passage rate adjustment part, which is formed between the trailing end of the ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the location of the air withdrawal fun <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In this part, the air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is increased in sectional size to reduce the air passage rate and provide rectification so as to reduce measurement data fluctuations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> designates an air quantity adjustment part, which is provided right before or right after the air withdrawal fun and permits air withdrawal adjustment without having any adverse effect on the ion detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment. In this case, the resin material outer surface constituting the cylindrical case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the outer surface of the ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is covered by an electrically conductive material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thus providing double-wall structure which is free from adverse effects of static electricity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment. In this case, a hollow part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed between the electrodes, i.e., the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in the ion detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and also on the resin casing constituting the cylindrical case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the outer side of the electrodes. The hollow part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serves to prevent internal charging as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment. In this case, a detecting part on an ion detecting circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted on a control board <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is disposed to be closest to a contact of the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thus preventing as much as possible adverse effects of noise due to provision of circuit and lead lines wherefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, it is possible, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, to provide both numerical value display and graphic display of positive and negative air ions, so that the balance between the positive and negative air ions can be recognized at a glance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is possible to display temperature, relative humidity, time, atmospheric air pressure, etc. as well as air ion data by providing various sensors and clock IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, it is possible to display, by utilizing a numerical display part, the battery use-up, ion detector abnormality (such as short-circuit due to foreign particles), cautions other than working environment and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For measuring, for instance, negative ions in air with the above construction, air is passed through the air passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by driving the air withdrawal fun <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> held negatively charged. In this way, negative ions in air are repelled to be more readily collected on the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, while positive ions are attracted to and neutralized by the negatively charged repelling electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The charge collected on the charge collector electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is converted to voltage and measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the prior art ion detector, the charge collector electrode is disposed at the center of the cylindrical repelling electrode or mid way between a pair of flat conversion electrodes. According to the invention, the charge collector and repelling electrodes are disposed on one side of the structure. Thus, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the device and also reduce the number of components to reduce cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, the air withdrawal fun is oriented laterally with respect to the air withdrawal direction, thus permitting size and thickness reduction of the air ion measuring device body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the ion detector has a lid portion capable of being opened and closed, thus permitting ready cleaning of the ion detector and prevention of dust particles from being attached in the inside. It is thus possible to obtain accurate measurement results at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Still further, the ion detector has the structure having flat side surfaces free from recessed or raised portions, and is also provided with the air passage rate adjustment part and the air quantity adjustment part. Thus, it is possible to hold a constant air passage rate, and also the ion mobility is constant. It is thus possible to increase the reliability of measurement and improve the accuracy of the measurement results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Yet further, such measures as the double-wall structure for coping with static electricity, the hollow part as a charging prevention measure and the disposition of the detecting part of the ion detection circuit in the vicinity of the contact of the charge collector electrode as a measure for preventing noise due to the presence of circuit and lead lines wherefrom, are provided. It is thus possible to obtain air ion measurement of improved accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the invention the positive and negative ion data are displayed by graphic display as well as numerical value display, thus permitting recognition of the balance between the positive and negative ions at a glance. It is thus possible to provide the user with good visual recognition property to instantly recognize and grasp the air ion state. Also, it is made possible to display other parameters than the air ion state, such as temperature, relative humidity, date, time and atmospheric air pressure by the provision of various sensors and clock IC. It is further made possible to display such items as battery use-up, detecting part abnormality (such as short-circuit due to foreign particles) and cautions other than working environments by making use of a numerical display art. Thus, for the user of the air ion measuring device according to the invention, not only air ion measurement is obtainable, but also many useful data are made available at hand. </paragraph>
