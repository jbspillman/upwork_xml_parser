<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to techniques for changing the operating characteristics of an internal combustion engine. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and apparatus for preventing an engine-operating-characteristic changing device from being locked in a first operating state by locking unit, during an operation of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device which is operable between the first operating state and a second operating state, to change a compression ratio of an intake air of an internal combustion engine, for controlling the operating characteristic of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the field of an internal combustion engine of an automobile, it is known to control the engine such that the engine is operated at a comparatively low compression ratio of an intake air so as to reduce the vibration and improve the fuel economy of the engine, during normal operation of the engine after a warm-up operation, while the engine is operated in a cold state at a comparatively high compression ratio of the intake air, so as to facilitate the starting of the engine, before the warm-up operation, particularly upon cranking of the engine in a cold state. The compression ratio of the intake air may be controlled depending upon a change in the load acting on the engine, even after the warm-up operation of the engine, in order to improve the fuel economy of the engine. In the case of an internal combustion engine of piston type, the compression ratio of the intake air can be changed in various methods by a valve timing regulating device, which is arranged, for instance: (a) to retard or advance the closing timing of each intake valve; (b) to temporarily open each exhaust valve at a suitably selected timing during a period of transition from the intake stroke to the compression stroke; (c) to suitably control the lift amounts of intake- and exhaust-valve drive cams in the form of three-dimensional cams; or (d) to provide an adjustable eccentric bearing at a point of connection between a piston rod and a crankshaft, or between the piston rod and a piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An example of an intake-valve timing control device arranged to retard or advance the closing timing of the intake valve for changing the compression ratio of the intake air is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,395 owned by the assignee of the present application. The intake-valve timing control device disclosed therein is arranged to change the opening and closing timings of the intake valve within respective predetermined ranges of the angular position or phase of the crankshaft, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in particular, to retard or advance the closing timing relative to the reciprocating movement of the piston, so that the quantity of the intake air introduced in the corresponding cylinder at the moment of closure of the intake valve is increased or reduced to control the compression ratio of the intake valve. In a four-cycle engine, the closing timing of the intake valve generally corresponds to about 70&deg; after the bottom dead center (abbreviated as &ldquo;ABDC)&rdquo; of the reciprocating movement of the piston. The intake-valve timing control device is arranged to increase this ABDC angle to about 110-120&deg;, for retarding the closing timing, so that the quantity of the intake air existing in the cylinder upon closing of the intake valve is accordingly reduced. As a result, the compression ratio of the intake air is reduced. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by way of example, the pressure within the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke considerably varies with a change in the closing timing of the intake valve by the intake-valve timing control device described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the internal combustion engine wherein the compression ratio of the intake air is variable as described above, the compression ratio of the intake air is controlled to be comparatively low in a hot state of the engine after a warm-up operation, to permit a relatively higher cranking speed for starting the engine with reduced amounts of vibration and noise. When the engine is started in a cold state, the compression ratio of the intake air is controlled to be comparatively high, to assure a high degree of starting stability of the engine. In this respect, the internal combustion engine capable of changing the compression ratio of the intake air is suitable for automotive vehicles recently developed to meet increasing requirements for saving of fuel resources and environmental protection, such as economy-running system vehicles adapted to temporarily turn off the engine when the vehicle is stopped at a traffic signal, for instance, and hybrid vehicles which are driven by a suitably selected one of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, there is shown the intake-valve timing control device disclosed in the above-identified U.S. Patent, which is partly modified to meet the object of the present invention, and for adaptation to a hybrid vehicle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> are views taken along line A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which show the intake-valve timing control device in two different operating states. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, reference sign &ldquo;e&rdquo; denotes an internal combustion engine having a crankshaft c, which is operatively connected through a torque distributing device p of planetary gear type to a first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, each of which is capable of functioning selectively as an electric motor and an electric generator. The internal combustion engine e, the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> cooperate to constitute a regenerative hybrid drive system which is operatively connected at a drive shaft of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a pair of wheels w, through respective axles s, a differential gear d and a transmission t. The first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to a battery b through an inverter i, and are selectively operated as an electric motor or an electric generator, depending upon the specific operating or running state of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The above-indicated intake-valve timing control device, which is generally indicated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, may be considered to function as an intake-air compression-ratio control unit for controlling the compression ratio of the intake air, as described below. This intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed to operate as a rotary actuator operable between a gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is driven by the crankshaft c of the internal combustion engine e through an endless belt <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in synchronization with the crankshaft c. The intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> holds an intake-valve operating cam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Described more specifically, an internally splined annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having four radial partition walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and an annular end plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are fixedly assembled with the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through four bolts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so as to define a working chamber. In this working chamber, there is accommodated a rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> fixed to one end of the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a bolt <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a central hub portion, and four vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed around the hub portion. A sectorial chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed between the adjacent two partition walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located on the respective circumferentially opposite sides of each vane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, so that the vane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is movable in the corresponding sectorial chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, relative to a housing which is constituted by the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and end plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The housing is rotated in the clockwise direction indicated by arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> when the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is rotated through the endless belt <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by forward rotation of the crankshaft c. In the state of the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in a fully retarded angular position relative to the crankshaft c, in which the closing timing of the intake valve is fully retarded. In the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, on the other hand, the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed in a fully advanced angular position relative to the crankshaft c, in which the closing timing is fully advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One of the vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a stepped cylindrical hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having a large-diameter portion and a small-diameter portion. A lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the form of a stepped piston having a large-diameter head portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is fitted in the stepped cylindrical hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such that the large-diameter head portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> engage the respective large-diameter and small-diameter portions of the stepped cylindrical hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and such that a movement of the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is guided by sliding contact of the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the small-diameter portion of the hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. When the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed in its fully advanced angular position relative to the crankshaft c, that is, when the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been rotated relative to the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move the vane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (having the stepped cylindrical hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is movable into an engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed in the corresponding portion of the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is biased by a compression coil spring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> toward the bottom of the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, so that the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is brought into the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> against a biasing force of the compression coil spring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, when the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been rotated relative to the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, while a hydraulic pressure is not applied to an annular working chamber (indicated by the position from which lead line for the reference numeral <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extends in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which is defined by the large-diameter portion of the stepped cylindrical hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. With the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thus fitted in the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is held in its fully advanced angular position relative to the crankshaft c. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A first port <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a second port <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are open to each of the four sectorial chambers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is formed between the adjacent ones of the four radial partition walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first ports <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are provided to apply a hydraulic pressure to the vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated relative to the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the counterclockwise direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, while the second ports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are provided to apply a hydraulic pressure to the vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated in the clockwise direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The first ports <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are held in communication with an annular oil passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, while the second ports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are held in communication with an annular oil passage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The oil passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is also held in communication with the above-indicated annular working chamber (indicated by the lead line for the reference sign <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) partly defined by the stepped cylindrical hold <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The annular oil passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is communicated with an annular oil passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through an oil passage <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed through the end portion of the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The annular oil passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed in a bearing portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is provided in the cylinder head of the internal combustion engine e. On the other hand, the annular oil passage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is communicated with an annular oil passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> formed in the bearing portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, through oil passages <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed through the end portion of the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The annular oil passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to a first port <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of a solenoid-operated hydraulic pressure control valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through a port <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and an oil passage <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> connected to the port <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, while the annular oil passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is connected to a second port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic pressure control valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through a port <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and an oil passage <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The solenoid-operated hydraulic pressure control valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a valve housing <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, a solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, a compression coil spring <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and a valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that is axially movable by the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the compression coil spring <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> within the valve housing <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The valve housing <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has a pressure port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a first drain port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and a second drain port <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, in addition to the above-indicated ports <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The pressure port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> receives a pressurized fluid from a hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the first drain port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided for selective communication of the first port <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with an oil reservoir <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, while the second drain port <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is provided for selective communication of the second port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with the oil reservoir <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is controlled to control the position of the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for controlling fluid flows among the various ports indicated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is controlled according to a control signal generated by an electronic control unit (ECU) <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> incorporating a computer. When the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is in a de-energized state, the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is held at its rightmost position (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) under a biasing action of the compression coil spring <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. In this position, the second port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is held in communication with the pressure port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, while the first port <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is held in communication with the first drain port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. When the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is operated while the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is placed in the rightmost position, the pressurized fluid delivered from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is fed to the sectional chambers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through the oil passage <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, port <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, annular oil passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, oil passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, oil passage <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, annular oil passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and second port <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, so that the vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receive the pressurized pressure in a direction that causes the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be rotated relative to the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the clockwise direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, whereby the closing timing of the intake valve is advanced. When the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been rotated to an angular position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> corresponding to the fully advanced angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is aligned with the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and is moved in the right direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, so that the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is brought into engagement with the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> under the biasing action of the compression coil spring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Thus, the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is locked in its fully advanced angular position. Inmediately after the internal combustion engine e has been started, however, the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not placed in its fully advanced angular position, since the delivery pressure of the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has not been sufficiently raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is energized, on the other hand, the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is moved to its leftmost position as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, against the biasing force of the compression coil spring <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. In this position, the first port <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is held in communication with the pressure port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> while the second port <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is held in communication with the second drain port <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. When the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is operated while the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is placed in its leftmost position, the pressurized fluid delivered from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is fed to the above-indicated annular working chamber of the stepped cylindrical hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as well as the sectorial chambers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, through the oil passage <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, port <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, annular oil passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, oil passage <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, annular oil passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and first ports <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As a result, the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> against the biasing force of the compression coil spring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, with a hydraulic pressure within the annular working chamber in the hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, if the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is received in the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Thus, the small-diameter portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is moved out of the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated relative to the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the counterclockwise direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, with the vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> receiving the hydraulic pressure in that direction, so that the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated relative to the crankshaft c, toward the fully retarded angular position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> When the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is alternately energized and de-energized with a controlled duty ratio, the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is located at a position between the rightmost and leftmost positions, which position is determined by the duty ratio, so that the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated to an angular position at which the hydraulic pressures on the opposite sides of each vane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are made equal. As a result, the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed in an angular position relative to the crankshaft c, which angular position is between the fully advanced and fully retarded angular positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The ECU <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive various signals including: a signal Sk indicating whether a key switch (not shown) provided on the vehicle has been turned on, and whether the key switch has been rotated to a cranking position for cranking the internal combustion engine e; a signal Da indicative of an amount of operation of an accelerator pedal; a signal Ve indicative of a running speed of the vehicle; a signal Ne indicative of an operating speed of the internal combustion engine e; a signal Te indicative of a temperature of the internal combustion engine e; a signal Ac indicative of the angular position of the crankshaft c; and a signal Av indicative of the angular position of the intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; signals &ohgr;r, &ohgr;s indicative of the operating speeds of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The vehicle control unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> performs various control operations according to control programs, on the basis of the input signals as indicated above. The control operations include an operation to control the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in the manner as described above, for controlling the closing timing of the intake valve relative to the reciprocation of the piston of the engine e. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The torque distributing device p of planetary gear type schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be described in detail referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. The torque distributing device p incorporates a planetary gear mechanism including a planetary carrier to which the crankshaft c of the internal combustion engine e is connected, a ring gear to which the drive shaft of the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected, and a sun gear to which the drive shaft of the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected. Thus, the internal combustion engine e, the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to each other through the planetary gear mechanism, such that the rotary motions of those drive sources have a predetermined differential relationship determined by the planetary gear mechanism. The torque distributing device p has an operating state in which the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in the off state (indicated at A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>), and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also in the off state (indicated at B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>), while the internal combustion engine e is also in the off state. The torque distributing device p has another operating state in which the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in the forward direction (as indicated at C), and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also operated in the forward direction (as indicated at D), while the internal combustion engine is also operated in the forward direction. In this operating state, the internal combustion engine e is placed in one of the following operating conditions: operated to drive the vehicle; operating to apply an engine-brake to the vehicle; operated in a racing condition; and operated by cranking to be started. Each of the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed in one of the following operating conditions: operated as an electric motor to generate a vehicle drive force; operated as an electric generator while receiving a drive power; and operated in a racing condition. Whether each of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is operated in the forward or reverse direction as the electric motor or the electric generator is determined by an operating state of an electric circuit controlled by the inverter i. In one forward running state of the hybrid vehicle in which the internal combustion engine e is in the off state, the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the axles s is operated as the electric motor in the forward direction (as indicated at C) while the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is operated as the electric motor in the reverse direction (as indicated at E). In a reverse running state of the hybrid vehicle in which the engine is in the off state, the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated as the electric motor in the reverse direction (as indicated at F) while the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is operated as the electric motor in the forward direction (as indicated at G). When the crankshaft c is rotated in the reverse direction to establish the previously described first operating state to increase the compression ratio of the intake air upon starting the vehicle, the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be operated in the reverse direction (as indicated at H) while the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> remains in the off state. There is also an operating state in which the internal combustion engine e is operated in the reverse direction due to a loss of equilibrium between the rotating speeds of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (indicated at I and J) while the internal combustion engine e is held in a substantially off state. This operating state will be described with respect to the problem to be solved by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the internal combustion engine e provided with the intake-air compression-ratio control device, the compression ratio of the intake air is maintained at a comparatively low value in a normal operation after the warm-up operation. This aspect will be described with respect to the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the normal operation after the warm-up operation, the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, or in a state close to the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, so that the closing timing of the intake valve is fully retarded or almost fully retarded. When the engine is started a relatively short time after the engine is temporarily stopped, the engine is still in a hot state, and the engine can be cranked to be started even if the compression ratio of the intake air is maintained at the comparatively low value, with the closing timing of the intake valve being fully or almost fully retarded. In this condition, the engine can be started with reduced amounts of vibration and noise owing to the comparatively low compression ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the engine is initially started to drive the vehicle, the engine is in a cold state. The engine is also in a cold state when the engine is started a relatively long time after the engine is temporarily stopped during running of the vehicle. The engine in a cold state can be easily started by cranking after the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been operated to advance the closing timing of the intake valve. Before the engine is started, however, the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> used as a hydraulic pressure source is not operated, and the pressurized fluid for controlling the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not available. Accordingly, the closing timing of the intake valve cannot be advanced by the hydraulic pressure before cranking of the engine. In view of this, the crankshaft c of the internal combustion engine e is temporarily rotated in the reverse direction by one or both of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to rotate the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the reverse direction relative to the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is held stationary together with the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed in the fully advanced angular position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in which the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are mechanically locked by the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, the compression ratio of the intake air is increased prior to the cranking of the engine, to facilitate the starting of the engine in a cold state. However, the cranking of the engine at an increased compression ratio of the intake air undesirably causes a larger amount of vibration of the engine than at a comparatively low normal compression ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the economy-running system vehicle or hybrid vehicle provided with the engine-operating-characteristic changing device capable of increasing or lowering the compression ratio of the intake air, the compression ratio is usually held at the comparatively low normal value or at a further lowered value when the engine is temporarily stopped by the ECU <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> after an operation of the engine in a hot state and at the comparatively low normal value. This change of the compression ratio of the intake air takes place since the compression ratio is controlled in response to the rotating speed of the crankshaft c, irrespective of any one of the previously described various methods (a)-(d), which is used to change the compression ratio. Namely, a suitable control element of the engine-operating-characteristic changing means is controlled so as to follow a change of the rotating speed of the crankshaft c, so that the compression ratio of the intake air is lowered when the hydraulic pressure source for controlling the intake-air compression-ratio control device is not available. In the hybrid drive assembly of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in which the internal combustion engine e is connected to the two motor/generator units mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that the rotary motions of those drive sources have a predetermined differential relationship, the internal combustion engine e placed in the off state may be operated in the reverse direction due to a loss of equilibrium between the rotating speeds of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in the forward direction (as indicated at I in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) while the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in the reverse direction (as indicated at J in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In this event, there is a possibility that the lock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is brought into engagement with the engaging hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, locking the camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the fully advanced angular position in which the compression ratio of the intake air is held at the increased value. If this locking takes place while the engine is operated in a hot state, a relatively large amount of vibration is generated by the engine during its cranking or normal operation in the hot state, due to the unnecessarily increased compression ratio of the intake air, and a driving comfort of the vehicle is deteriorated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method of controlling an engine-operating-characteristic changing device capable of changing the compression ratio of an intake air of an engine including a locking unit for locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in an operating state in which the compression ratio is maintained at an increased value. The method is improved so as to prevent undesirable locking of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the above-indicated operating state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The object described above may be achieved by a method of controlling an engine-operating-characteristic changing device that changes a compression ratio of an intake air of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle. The engine-operating-characteristic changing device is operable between a first operating state that provides a first compression ratio and a second operating state that provides a second compression ratio that is lower than the first compression ratio. The engine-operating-characteristic changing device includes a locking unit for locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state. The method includes the steps of determining whether there is a possibility that the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is locked in the first operating state by the locking unit when the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is not to be placed in the first operating state, and, when it is determined that there is the possibility, preventing the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The engine-operating-characteristic changing device makes the first compression ratio higher than the second compression ratio by advancing a closing timing of an intake valve of the internal combustion engine relative to an angular phase of a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine in the first operating state with respect to the closing timing in the second operating state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The closing timing of the intake valve with respect to the angular phase of the crankshaft is controlled by an intake-valve timing control device provided in a rotation transmitting device that transmits rotary motion of the crankshaft to an intake-valve camshaft of the internal combustion engine. The locking unit acts between a first rotary member of the intake-valve timing control device rotated in synchronization with the crankshaft and a second rotary member of the intake-valve timing control device disposed coaxially with the first rotary member and rotated in synchronization with the intake-valve camshaft. When the closing timing of the intake valve is to be set to a predetermined phase on an advanced side in an adjustable range of the closing timing, the locking unit locks the first and second rotary members in a relative angular position that corresponds to the predetermined phase of the closing timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is determined that there is the possibility of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device being locked by the locking unit in the first operating state when a difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members becomes equal to or smaller than a predetermined first threshold value. It is also determined that there is the possibility of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device being locked by the locking unit in the first operating state when a rate of change of the difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members becomes equal to or lower than a negative threshold value and the difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members is equal to or smaller than a predetermined second threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The intake-valve timing control device includes a driving unit for rotating the second rotary member relative to the first rotary member to retard the closing timing of the intake valve. The step of preventing the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device includes operating the driving unit to rotate the second rotary member relative to the first rotary member so as to retard the closing timing of the intake valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The internal combustion engine is employed for a hybrid vehicle including a first motor/generator and a second motor/generator to which the internal combustion engine is connected through a differential mechanism and which are rotatable in opposite directions so as to keep the internal combustion engine stopped and so as to operate the internal combustion engine in a reverse direction. The relative angular position of the first and second rotary member is changed in one of an advancing direction to advance the closing timing of the intake valve or a retarding direction to retard the closing timing by controlling the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator to be rotated in the opposite directions. It is determined that there is the possibility of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device being locked in the first operating state, when the internal combustion engine is operated in the reverse direction at an angular velocity not lower than a predetermined threshold with the first operations of the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator in the opposite directions. The step of preventing the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device includes preventing the internal combustion engine from being operated in the reverse direction by establishing an equilibrium between the rotating speeds of the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator in the opposite directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The locking unit includes a lock pin engageable with an engaging hole. The step of preventing the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device comprises preventing the lock pin from being aligned with the engaging hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The method further includes the step of adjusting a frequency at which the locking unit is prevented from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state. This adjustment of the frequency of the locking preventive control operation may include one or both of an adjustment of (a) a threshold value used in the determination as to whether there is the above-indicated possibility, and (b) an adjustment of the locking preventive control operation. The method further includes the step of adjusting at least one parameter used for determining the possibility of locking caused by the locking unit and preventing the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state, when the locking unit is operated at least a predetermined number of times irrespective of implementation of the control for preventing the operation of the locking unit. The predetermined number of times may be the number of operations of the locking unit within a predetermined time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned aspect of the invention, a method of controlling an engine-operating-characteristic changing device changes a compression ratio of an intake air of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle. The engine-operating-characteristic changing device is operable between a first operating state that provides a first compression ratio and a second operating state that provides a second compression ratio that is lower than the first compression ratio, and includes a locking unit for locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state. The method includes the steps of determining whether there is a possibility that the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is locked in the first operating state by the locking unit when the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is not to be placed in the first operating state, and, when it is determined that there is the possibility, preventing the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state. The present method is formulated to first determine whether there is a possibility that the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is locked in the first operating state by the locking unit, where the engine-operating-characteristic changing device should not be placed in the first operating state. Thus, the method makes it possible to detect one of serious faulty operations of the locking unit, namely, an operation of the locking unit to lock the engine-operating-characteristic changing means in the first operating state, where the internal combustion engine is in an operating state in which the compression ratio of the intake air should not be made high, in other words, where an increase of the compression ratio is unnecessary and harmful. The method is further formulated to implement a locking preventive control operation to prevent the locking unit from locking the engine-operating-characteristic changing means in the first operating state, if it is determined that there is the above-indicated possibility of locking. Accordingly, the method makes it possible to avoid the undesirable operation of the locking unit, which would cause vibration of the engine, and deterioration of the driving comfort of the vehicle, which is an important factor that determines the quality of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The engine-operating-characteristic changing device makes the first compression ratio higher than the second compression ratio by advancing a closing timing of an intake valve of the internal combustion engine relative to an angular phase of a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine in the first operating state with respect to the closing timing in the second operating state. The closing timing of the intake valve with respect to the angular phase of the crankshaft is controlled by an intake-valve timing control device provided in a rotation transmitting device that transmits rotary motion of the crankshaft to an intake-valve camshaft of the internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The locking unit acts between a first rotary member of the intake-valve timing control device rotated in synchronization with the crankshaft and a second rotary member of the intake-valve timing control device disposed coaxially with the first rotary member and rotated in synchronization with the intake-valve camshaft. When the closing timing of the intake valve is to be set to a predetermined phase on an advanced side in an adjustable range of the closing timing, the locking unit locks the first and second rotary members in a relative angular position that corresponds to the predetermined phase of the closing timing. In this case, a decrease in the difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members represents a change of the angular position of the second rotary member relative to that of the first rotary member in a direction to advance the closing time of the intake valve, namely, a change of the operating state of the intake-valve timing control device from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> toward that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Therefore, it can be determined that there is the possibility of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device being locked by the locking unit in the first operating state when a difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members becomes equal to or smaller than a predetermined first threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is determined that there is the possibility of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device being locked by the locking unit in the first operating state when a rate of change of the difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members becomes equal to or lower than a negative threshold value and the difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members is equal to or smaller than a predetermined second threshold value. In this instance, the possibility of locking of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the first operating state is detected on the basis of a time derivative of the difference between the angular positions of the first and second rotary members, that is, the rate at which the difference is reduced toward the state of locking of the changing means in the first operating state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The intake-valve timing control device may include drive unit in the form of a hydraulically operated rotary actuator operable to rotate the second member in the form of the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relative to the second member in the form of a housing constituted by the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and end plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this case, the locking preventive control operation may be implemented by this drive unit, that is, by operating the drive means to rotate the second rotary member relative to the first rotary member so as to retard the closing timing of the intake valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As described above, the internal combustion engine may be used for a hybrid vehicle including a drive mechanism with the internal combustion engine and a first motor/generator and a second motor/generator to which the engine is connected through a differential mechanism and which are operable in opposite directions so as to keep the engine stopped and so as to operate the engine in a reverse direction. In this hybrid vehicle, the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator may be arranged to be operated in the opposite directions, to change the relative angular position of the first and second rotary members in an advancing direction to advance the closing timing of the intake valve or in a retarding direction to retard the closing timing. In this arrangement, an operation of the internal combustion engine in the reverse direction due to the operations of the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator in the opposite directions will eventually cause the second rotary member to be placed in the fully advanced angular position relative to the first rotary member, so that there arises a possibility that the engine-operating-characteristic changing means is locked in the first operating state. If the internal combustion engine is operated in the reverse direction at an angular velocity not lower than a predetermined threshold during the operations of the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator in the opposite directions, it is possible to prevent the engine-operating-characteristic changing means from being locked in the first operating state, by preventing the internal combustion engine from being operated in the reverse direction, by establishing an equilibrium between the rotating speeds of the first motor/generator and the second motor/generator in the opposite directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of the manner of determination as to whether there is the above-indicated possibility of locking of the engine-operating-characteristic changing means and the manner of the locking preventive control operation, the frequency at which the locking preventive control operation is implemented can be automatically adjusted to the desired value, so as to optimize the locking preventive control to prevent the locking of the engine-operating-characteristic changing means according to the invention, where the threshold value to be used to determine the presence or absence of the above-indicated possibility of locking is adjusted on the basis of the frequency of the locking preventive control operation. The locking preventive control can be further optimized, where the degree of the locking preventive control operation is increased when the locking unit has been operated for more than a predetermined number of times or at a frequency higher than a threshold value, even after the locking preventive control operation.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring first to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a basic operation to control an operation of an engine-operating-characteristic changing device in the form of the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is arranged to change the compression ratio of an intake air of an internal combustion engine e. This control operation of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device according to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is initiated when the signal Sk indicative of an operating state of the key switch is generated by the ECU <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the control operation is initiated in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where various kinds of data used for the control operation are read. These kinds of data include the signal Sk indicative of the operating state of the key switch, the signal Da indicative of an amount of operation of the accelerator pedal, the signal Ve indicative of the vehicle running speed; the signal Ne indicative of the operating speed of the internal combustion engine e, the signal Te indicative of the temperature of the internal combustion engine e, the signal Ac indicative of the angular position of the crankshaft c, the signal Av indicative of the angular position of the intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the signals &ohgr;r, &ohgr;s indicative of the operating speeds of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The control flow then goes to step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in which the operating state of the engine is determined on the basis of the signals Da, Ve, Ne and Tc, and it is determined whether the engine-operating-characteristic changing device should be placed in a first operating state in which the compression ratio of the intake air is maintained at a comparatively high value. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is, it is not necessary to control the engine-operating-characteristic changing device, the control flow goes back to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and steps S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are repeatedly implemented, while the above-indicated kinds of data are updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> If NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the operating state of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is determined. That is, the angular position of the intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (the fully retarded position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the fully advanced position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, or any angular position between the fully retarded and advanced positions), and the direction in which the angular position is changed are determined. The operation in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the flowcharts of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is followed by step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether there is a possibility that the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is unnecessarily or undesirably locked in the first operating state, that is, in the fully advanced angular position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This determination in step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is made on the basis of the determinations in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. If NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, steps S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are repeatedly implemented while the above-indicated kinds of data are updated. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in which a preventive operation is implemented to prevent the engine-operating-characteristic changing device from being locked in the fully advanced position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates one example of the operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the operating state of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is determined. In this example, it is assumed that the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a difference (Ac&minus;Av) between the angular positions of the crankshaft c and the intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the internal combustion engine e is smaller than a predetermined threshold value &Dgr;A, which is relatively small. The determination in step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is made on the basis of the signals Ac and Av. If NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, i.e., it is determined that there is not the above-indicated possibility of locking, the control flow goes back to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in which it is determined that there is the above-indicated possibility of locking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates another example of the operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the operating state of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is determined. In this example, it is also assumed that the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a difference (Ac&minus;Av) between the angular positions of the crankshaft c and the intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the internal combustion engine e has become smaller than a predetermined threshold value Ao, which is relatively large and at which the locking of the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the fully advanced position is less likely to take place. The determination in step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is also made on the basis of the signals Ac and Av. If NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, i.e., it is determined that there is no possibility of locking, the control flow goes back to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether the rate of change d(Ac&minus;Av)/dt of the above-indicated difference of the angular positions is smaller than a predetermined negative threshold value &minus;&agr;, or that is, whether the absolute value &verbar;d(Ac&minus;Av)/dt&verbar; of the rate of change is larger than the absolute value &verbar;&minus;&agr;&verbar; of the threshold value &minus;&agr;. If YES is obtained in both steps S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, that is, the above-indicated difference of the angular positions is smaller than the threshold value Ao and this difference is decreasing at a rate higher than the predetermined value &agr;, it is determined that there is the above-indicated possibility of locking. In this case, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in which it is determined that there is the above-indicated possibility of locking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a further example of the operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the operating state of the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is determined. In this example, the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is also the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is assumed that the internal combustion engine is operatively connected to the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the torque distributing device p (differential device) of planetary gear type, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>A. In step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the operating speed &ohgr;c of the crankshaft c of the internal combustion engine e is lower than a predetermined negative threshold value &minus;&Dgr;&ohgr; the absolute value of which is relatively small. That is, in step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the crankshaft c is operated in the reverse direction at a speed higher than a predetermined threshold value &Dgr;&ohgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the planetary gear mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, an equation &ohgr;c&equals;(&ohgr;r&plus;f&ohgr;s)/(1&plus;f) is satisfied, wherein the rotating speeds of the sun gear, ring gear and carrier are represented by &ohgr;s, &ohgr;r and &ohgr;c, respectively, and the ratio of the number of teeth of the sun gear to that of the ring gear is represented by f (smaller than 1). While the crankshaft c is almost at rest during a temporary stop of the internal combustion engine, it is difficult to detect a small angle of rotation of the crankshaft in the reverse direction on the basis of the signal Ac indicative of the angular position of the crankshaft. When the temporary stop of the engine is caused by the rotations of the two motor/generator units in the drive mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>B, the rotating speeds &ohgr;r and &ohgr;s corresponding to the rotating speeds of the motor/generator units mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are relatively high, and the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction due to a loss of equilibrium between the rotating speeds &ohgr;r and &ohgr;s of the motor/generator units mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, by monitoring the rotating speeds &ohgr;r and &ohgr;s, it is possible to detect that the rotating speed &ohgr;c is lower than the predetermined negative threshold value &minus;&Dgr;&ohgr;, that is, to detect that the speed &ohgr;c of rotation in the reverse direction is higher than the absolute value &verbar;&minus;&Dgr;&ohgr;&verbar;. If the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction at a speed higher than the absolute value &verbar;&minus;&Dgr;&ohgr;&verbar;, the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is eventually locked in the fully advanced angular position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Therefore, if YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in which it is determined that there is the possibility of locking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates one example of a locking preventive control operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In this example, the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the locking preventive control is effected by increasing the duty ratio of the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic pressure control valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. According to a conventional control of the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> described above as related art the crankshaft of the engine is rotated in the reverse direction to place the intake-valve camshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the fully advanced angular position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, upon starting of the engine in a cold state, since the pressurized fluid is not available when the engine is started. However, the problem solved by the present invention takes place when the pressurized fluid is available, that is, primarily takes place when the engine is temporarily stopped. As described above, the problem occurs when the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is locked by the locking device in the first operating state in which the compression ratio of the intake air is maintained at a comparatively high value, where the changing device should not be placed in the placed in this first operating state. Since the pressurized fluid is available, an increase of the duty ratio of the solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> causes the valve spool <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to be moved in the left direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, permitting the pressurized fluid delivered from the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be fed into the sectorial chambers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through the port <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, oil passages <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the port <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, so that the rotor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated relative to the housing (constituted by the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, annular member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and end plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) of the control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, from the fully advanced angular position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> toward the fully retarded angular position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, preventing the locking of the control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the first operating state, that is, in the fully advanced position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates another example of the locking preventive control operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In this example, the engine-operating-characteristic changing device is also the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the internal combustion engine is operatively connected to the first and second motor/generator units through the torque distributing device p (differential device) of planetary gear type, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>A. The locking preventive control is effected by controlling the operating speed of the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and/or the operating speed of the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Described in detail, the locking preventive control is initiated in step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether the vehicle is running in the forward direction. In the drive mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>B, the axles s are connected to the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the differential gear d and the transmission t, the first motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in the forward direction (as indicated at C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>) while the second motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is operated in the reverse direction (as indicated at E), if the vehicle is running in the forward direction with the engine e held in a temporary stop. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. If NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, during the forward running of the vehicle, the forward operating speed of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is increased and/or the reverse operating speed of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reduced for preventing the locking of the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the fully advanced position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, during the reverse running of the vehicle, the reverse operating speed of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced and/or the forward operating speed of the motor/generator mg<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is increased for preventing the locking of the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the fully advanced position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this case, the locking preventive control operation is effected not only when the vehicle is running in the reverse direction, but also when the vehicle is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there will be described a second embodiment of this invention, which is a modification of the first embodiment illustrated in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In the modified embodiment, the frequency at which the locking preventive control operation in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is implemented is automatically adjusted to a desired value. That is, the modified embodiment is arranged such that the frequency or sensitivity of the locking preventive control operation is automatically adjusted to the desired value, at a predetermined time interval, so that the locking preventive control operation is implemented at the desired frequency, for preventing the engine-operating-characteristic changing device from being locked in the first operating state for increasing the compression ratio of the intake air, where the changing device should not be placed in the first operating state. The locking preventive control according to the embodiment is initiated in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which various kinds of data are read. Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is followed by step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether a flag F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set at &ldquo;b <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. Since the flag F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo; upon initiation of the locking preventive control and in step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (which will be described later), NO is obtained when step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is implemented for the first time or immediately after step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is implemented. In this case, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which a timer provided in the computer of the vehicle control unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is set, and count of a time lapse is started. After the timer is set, the flag F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, steps S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are skipped until the flag F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is followed by step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether the timer has timed out. Initially, NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the control flow goes to steps S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to implement the locking preventive control operation as needed, as described above by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. If the locking preventive control operation is implanted in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the control flow then goes to step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether a flag F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set at &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Since this flag F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also initially reset at &ldquo;1&rdquo;, NO is initially obtained in step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in which a count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of counter is incremented by &ldquo;1&rdquo;. This counter is provided in the computer of the ECU <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in which the flag F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. After the locking preventive control operation has been implemented in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, NO is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in which the flag F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. If the locking preventive control operation is again implemented, the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is again incremented. Thus, the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates the number of the locking preventive control operations performed in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is implemented after an operation of incrementing the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, in which it is determined whether the locking device has been activated to lock the intake-valve timing control device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the fully advanced angular position, even after the locking preventive control operation was carried out in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, steps S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are implemented to count the number of the operations of the locking device, as a count N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a counter which is provided in the computer of the vehicle control unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, like the counter for the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A flag F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> used for the count N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> When the above-indicated timer has timed out, YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in which the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is compared with a predetermined target value Na, obtain a difference (&Dgr;N&equals;N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;Na) between the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the target value Na, and, on the basis of the obtained difference, adjust the threshold value to be used in step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to make the determination as to whether there is the above-indicated possibility of locking, and/or the degree of the locking preventive control operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The aforementioned adjustment is made such that the count N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> approaches the desired value Na, that is, the difference &Dgr;N becomes zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is followed by step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in which it is determined whether the count N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> obtained in step S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is equal to or larger than a predetermined threshold value Nb. The count N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates the number of the operations of the locking unit performed irrespective of the locking preventive control operation. If YES is obtained in step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the control flow goes to step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in which the locking preventive control operation is further enhanced. More particularly, in step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the process of step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is repeatedly implemented. The count N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates the number of the operations of the locking device performed within a predetermined period of time in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>.
