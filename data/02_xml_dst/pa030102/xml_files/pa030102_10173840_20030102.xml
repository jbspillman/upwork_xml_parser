<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for producing biochemical analysis data and a scanner used therefor and, particularly, to a method for producing biochemical analysis data and a scanner used therefor which can produce biochemical analysis data having high quantitative characteristics by photoelectrically detecting light emitted from a plurality of spot-like regions even in the case where the plurality of spot-like regions labeled with a labeling substance are formed in a biochemical analysis unit at high density. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An autoradiographic analyzing system using as a detecting material for detecting radiation a stimulable phosphor which can absorb, store and record the energy of radiation when it is irradiated with radiation and which, when it is then stimulated by an electromagnetic wave having a specified wavelength, can release stimulated emission whose light amount corresponds to the amount of radiation with which it was irradiated is known, which comprises the steps of introducing a radioactively labeled substance into an organism, using the organism or a part of the tissue of the organism as a specimen, superposing the specimen and a stimulable phosphor sheet formed with a stimulable phosphor layer for a certain period of time, storing and recording radiation energy in a stimulable phosphor contained in the stimulable phosphor layer, scanning the stimulable phosphor layer with an electromagnetic wave to excite the stimulable phosphor, photoelectrically detecting the stimulated emission released from the stimulable phosphor to produce digital image signals, effecting image processing on the obtained digital image signals, and reproducing an image on displaying means such as a CRT or the like or a photographic film (see, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-60784, Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-60782, Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-3952 and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is further known chemiluminescence analysis system comprising the steps of employing, as a detecting material for light, a stimulable phosphor which can absorb and store the energy of light upon being irradiated therewith and release a stimulated emission whose amount is proportional to that of the received light upon being stimulated with an electromagnetic wave having a specific wavelength range, selectively labeling a fixed high molecular substance such as a protein or a nucleic acid sequence with a labeling substance which generates chemiluminescence emission when it contacts a chemiluminescent substance, contacting the high molecular substance selectively labeled with the labeling substance and the chemiluminescent substance, storing and recording the chemiluminescence emission in the wavelength of visible light generated by the contact of the chemiluminescent substance and the labeling substance in the stimulable phosphor contained in a stimulable phosphor layer formed on a stimulable phosphor sheet, scanning the stimulable phosphor layer with an electromagnetic wave to excite the stimulable phosphor, photoelectrically detecting the stimulated emission released from the stimulable phosphor to produce digital signals, effecting data processing on the obtained digital signals, and reproducing data on displaying means such as a CRT or a recording material such as a photographic film (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,028,793, UK Patent Application 2,246,197 A and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Unlike the system using a photographic film, according to these systems using the stimulable phosphor as a detecting material, development, which is chemical processing, becomes unnecessary. Further, it is possible reproduce a desired image by effecting image processing on the obtained image data and effect quantitative analysis using a computer. Use of a stimulable phosphor in these processes is therefore advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a fluorescence analyzing system using a fluorescent substance as a labeling substance instead of a radioactive labeling substance in the autoradiographic analyzing system is known. According to this system, it is possible to study a genetic sequence, study the expression level of a gene, and to effect separation or identification of protein or estimation of the molecular weight or properties of protein or the like. For example, this system can perform a process including the steps of distributing a plurality of DNA fragments on a gel support by means of electrophoresis after a fluorescent dye was added to a solution containing a plurality of DNA fragments to be distributed, or distributing a plurality of DNA fragments on a gel support containing a fluorescent dye, or dipping a gel support on which a plurality of DNA fragments have been distributed by means of electrophoresis in a solution containing a fluorescent dye, thereby labeling the electrophoresed DNA fragments, exciting the fluorescent dye by a stimulating ray to cause it to release fluorescence emission, detecting the released fluorescence emission to produce an image and detecting the distribution of the DNA fragments on the gel support. This system can also perform a process including the steps of distributing a plurality of DNA fragments on a gel support by means of electrophoresis, denaturing the DNA fragments, transferring at least a part of the denatured DNA fragments onto a transfer support such as a nitrocellulose support by the Southern-blotting method, hybridizing a probe prepared by labeling target DNA and DNA or RNA complementary thereto with the denatured DNA fragments, thereby selectively labeling only the DNA fragments complementary to the probe DNA or probe RNA, exciting the fluorescent dye by a stimulating ray to cause it to release fluorescence emission, detecting the released fluorescence emission to produce an image and detecting the distribution of the target DNA on the transfer support. This system can further perform a process including the steps of preparing a DNA probe complementary to DNA containing a target gene labeled by a labeling substance, hybridizing it with DNA on a transfer support, combining an enzyme with the complementary DNA labeled by a labeling substance, causing the enzyme to contact a fluorescent substance, transforming the fluorescent substance to a fluorescent substance having fluorescence emission releasing property, exciting the thus produced fluorescent substance by a stimulating ray to release fluorescence emission, detecting the fluorescence emission to produce an image and detecting the distribution of the target DNA on the transfer support. This fluorescence detecting system is advantageous in that a genetic sequence or the like can be easily detected without using a radioactive substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similarly, there is known a chemiluminescence detecting system comprising the steps of fixing a substance derived from a living organism such as a protein or a nucleic acid sequence on a support, selectively labeling the substance derived from a living organism with a labeling substance which generates chemiluminescence emission when it contacts a chemiluminescent substrate, contacting the substance derived from a living organism and selectively labeled with the labeling substance and the chemiluminescent substrate, photoelectrically detecting the chemiluminescence emission in the wavelength of visible light generated by the contact of the chemiluminescent substrate and the labeling substance to produce digital image signals, effecting image processing thereon, and reproducing a chemiluminescent image on a display means such as a CRT or a recording material such as a photographic film, thereby obtaining information relating to the high molecular substance such as genetic information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, a micro-array analyzing system has been recently developed, which comprises the steps of using a spotting device to drop at different positions on the surface of a carrier such as a slide glass plate, a membrane filter or the like specific binding substances, which can specifically bind with a substance derived from a living organism such as a cell, virus, hormone, tumor marker, enzyme, antibody, antigen, abzyme, other protein, a nuclear acid, cDNA, DNA, RNA or the like and whose sequence, base length, composition and the like are known, thereby forming a number of independent spots, specifically binding the specific binding substances using a hybridization method or the like with a substance derived from a living organism such as a cell, virus, hormone, tumor marker, enzyme, antibody, antigen, abzyme, other protein, a nuclear acid, cDNA, DNA or mRNA by extraction, isolation or the like and optionally further subjected to chemical processing, chemical modification or the like and which is labeled with a labeling substance such as a fluorescent substance, dye or the like, thereby forming a micro-array, irradiating the micro-array with a stimulating ray, photoelectrically detecting light such as fluorescence emission released from a labeling substance such as a fluorescent substance, dye or the like, and analyzing the substance derived from a living organism. This micro-array analyzing system is advantageous in that a substance derived from a living organism can be analyzed in a short time period by forming a number of spots of specific binding substances at different positions of the surface of a carrier such as a slide glass plate at high density and hybridizing them with a substance derived from a living organism and labeled with a labeling substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, a macro-array analyzing system using a radioactive labeling substance as a labeling substance has been further developed, which comprises the steps of using a spotting device to drop at different positions on the surface of a carrier such as a membrane filter or the like specific binding substances, which can specifically bind with a substance derived from a living organism such as a cell, virus, hormone, tumor marker, enzyme, antibody, antigen, abzyme, other protein, a nuclear acid, cDNA, DNA, RNA or the like and whose sequence, base length, composition and the like are known, thereby forming a number of independent spots, specifically binding the specific binding substance using a hybridization method or the like with a substance derived from a living organism such as a cell, virus, hormone, tumor marker, enzyme, antibody, antigen, abzyme, other protein, a nuclear acid, cDNA, DNA or mRNA by extraction, isolation or the like and optionally further subjected to chemical processing, chemical modification or the like and which is labeled with a radioactive labeling substance, thereby forming a macro-array, superposing the macro-array and a stimulable phosphor sheet formed with a stimulable phosphor layer, exposing the stimulable phosphor layer to a radioactive labeling substance, irradiating the stimulable phosphor layer with a stimulating ray to excite the stimulable phosphor, photoelectrically detecting the stimulated emission released from the stimulable phosphor to produce biochemical analysis data, and analyzing the substance derived from a living organism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, in the macro-array analyzing system using a radioactive labeling substance as a labeling substance, when the stimulable phosphor layer is exposed to a radioactive labeling substance, since the radiation energy of the radioactive labeling substance contained in spot-like regions formed on the surface of a carrier such as a membrane filter is very large, electron beams (&bgr; rays) released from the radioactive labeling substance contained in the individual spot-like regions are scattered in the carrier such as a membrane filter, thereby impinging on regions of the stimulable phosphor layer that should be exposed only to the radioactive labeling substance contained in neighboring spot-like regions, to generate noise in biochemical analysis data produced by photoelectrically detecting stimulated emission, thus making data of neighboring spot-like regions hard to separate and lowering resolution, and to lower the accuracy of biochemical analysis data when a substance derived from a living organism is analyzed by quantifying the radiation amount of each spot. The degradation of the resolution and accuracy of biochemical analysis is particularly pronounced when spots are formed close to each other at high density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to solve these problems by preventing noise caused by the scattering of electron beams released from radioactive labeling substance contained in neighboring spot-like regions, it is inevitably required to increase the distance between neighboring spot-like regions and this makes the density of the spot-like regions lower and the test efficiency lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the field of biochemical analysis, it is often required to analyze a substance derived from a living organism by forming a plurality of spot-like regions containing specific binding substances at different positions on the surface of a carrier such as a membrane filter or the like, which can specifically bind with a substance derived from a living organism such as a cell, virus, hormone, tumor marker, enzyme, antibody, antigen, abzyme, other protein, a nuclear acid, cDNA, DNA, RNA or the like and whose sequence, base length, composition and the like are known, specifically binding, using a hybridization method or the like, the specific binding substances contained in the plurality of spot-like regions with a substance derived from a living organism labeled with a labeling substance which generates chemiluminescence emission when it contacts a chemiluminescent substrate, thereby selectively labeling the plurality of spot-like regions, causing the plurality of spot-like regions to come into contact with a chemiluminescent substrate, exposing the stimulable phosphor layer of a stimulable phosphor sheet to chemiluminescence emission in the wavelength of visible light generated by the contact of the chemiluminescent substance and the labeling substance, thereby storing the energy of chemiluminescence emission in the stimulable phosphor layer, irradiating the stimulable phosphor layer with a stimulating ray, and photoelectrically detecting stimulated emission released from the stimulable phosphor layer, thereby effecting biochemical analysis. In this case, chemiluminescence emission released from any particular spot-like region is scattered in the carrier such as a membrane filter, thereby impinging on regions of the stimulable phosphor layer that should be exposed only to the chemiluminescence emission released from neighboring spot-like regions to generate noise in biochemical analysis data produced by photoelectrically detecting stimulated emission, thus making data of neighboring spot-like regions hard to separate and lowering resolution, and to lower the quantitative characteristics of biochemical analysis data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, in the field of biochemical analysis, it is often required to analyze a substance derived from a living organism by forming a plurality of spot-like regions containing specific binding substances spot-like formed at different positions on the surface of a carrier such as a membrane filter or the like, which can specifically bind with a substance derived from a living organism such as a cell, virus, hormone, tumor marker, enzyme, antibody, antigen, abzyme, other protein, a nuclear acid, cDNA, DNA, RNA or the like and whose sequence, base length, composition and the like are known, specifically binding, using a hybridization method or the like, the specific binding substances contained in the plurality of spot-like regions with a substance derived from a living organism labeled with a labeling substance which generates chemiluminescence emission when it contacts a chemiluminescent substrate and/or a fluorescent substance, thereby selectively labeling the plurality of spot-like regions, and causing it to contact a chemiluminescent substrate, thereby photoelectrically detecting the chemiluminescence emission in the wavelength of visible light, or irradiating it with a stimulating ray, thereby photoelectrically detecting fluorescence emission released from a fluorescent substance. In these cases, chemiluminescence emission or fluorescence emission released from the plurality of spot-like regions is scattered in the carrier such as a membrane filter or chemiluminescence emission or fluorescence emission released from any particular spot-like region is scattered and mixed with chemiluminescence emission or fluorescence emission released from neighboring spot-like regions, thereby generating noise in biochemical analysis data produced by photoelectrically detecting chemiluminescence emission and/or fluorescence emission. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing biochemical analysis data and a scanner used therefor which can produce biochemical analysis data having high quantitative characteristics by photoelectrically detecting light emitted from a plurality of spot-like regions even in the case where the plurality of spot-like regions labeled with a labeling substance are formed in a biochemical analysis unit at high density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above other objects of the present invention can be accomplished by a method for producing biochemical analysis data by photoelectrically detecting light released from a plurality of light releasable regions two-dimensionally formed so as to be spaced apart from each other in a sample placed on a sample stage, the method for producing biochemical analysis data comprising the steps of intermittently moving a light guide member for leading light released from the plurality of light releasable regions to a light detector and the sample stage relative to each other in a main scanning direction and a sub-scanning direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction, leading light released from the plurality of light releasable regions two-dimensionally formed so as to be spaced apart from each other in the sample to a light detector through the light guide member, and photoelectrically detecting light by the light detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to one application of the present invention, even in the case where a plurality of spot-like regions selectively labeled with a radioactive labeling substance are formed in a biochemical analysis unit such as a membrane filter at a high density, biochemical analysis data having high quantitative characteristics can be produced with high resolution by superposing a stimulable phosphor sheet formed with a plurality of stimulable phosphor layer regions in the same pattern as that of the plurality of spot-like regions formed in the biochemical analysis unit on the biochemical analysis unit in such a manner that each of the stimulable phosphor layer regions of the stimulable phosphor sheet faces the corresponding absorptive region of the biochemical analysis unit, exposing the plurality of stimulable phosphor layer regions of the stimulable phosphor sheet to a radioactive labeling substance contained in the plurality of spot-like regions while preventing electron beams (&bgr; rays) released from the radioactive labeling substance contained in any particular spot-like region from entering stimulable phosphor layer regions other than that to be exposed to electron beams (&bgr; rays) released from the radioactive labeling substance contained in the spot-like region, thereby storing radiation energy therein, placing the stimulable phosphor sheet on the sample stage, sequentially irradiating the plurality of stimulable phosphor layer regions of the stimulable phosphor sheet placed on the sample stage with a stimulating ray while intermittently moving the light guide member and the sample stage relative to each other in a main scanning direction and a sub-scanning direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction, sequentially exciting stimulable phosphor contained in the stimulable phosphor layer regions, leading stimulated emission released from the stimulable phosphor layer regions through the light guide member to the light detector, and photoelectrically detecting the stimulated emission by the light detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> More specifically, according to this application of the present invention, it is possible to reliably project a stimulating ray led through the light guide member onto only the stimulable phosphor layer region of the stimulable phosphor sheet to be irradiated therewith, excite stimulable phosphor contained in the stimulable phosphor layer region to cause it to release stimulated emission, receive stimulated emission by the light receiving end portion of the light guide member to lead it to the light detector and photoelectrically detect stimulated emission by the light detector by positioning the light guide member so that the light receiving end portion thereof is considerably close to the stimulable phosphor layer region when biochemical analysis data are to be produced by irradiating the plurality of stimulable phosphor layer regions two-dimensionally formed to be spaced apart from each other in the stimulable phosphor sheet with the stimulating ray to excite stimulable phosphor contained in the stimulable phosphor layer regions and photoelectrically detecting stimulated emission released from the stimulable phosphor layer regions.
