<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A folder type mobile telephone and control method therefor are provided which utilize an auxiliary display unit viewable whether the folder is opened or closed. The folder type mobile telephone includes an auxiliary display unit and a main body having a main display unit. The folder type mobile telephone includes an opening at a position corresponding to the auxiliary display unit. The folder type mobile telephone may include a wheel button formed at one side of the main body to input user commands to the auxiliary display unit. A transparent window may be formed at the opening to protect the auxiliary display unit. Regardless of whether the folder is opened or closed, a user can view, and control the auxiliary display unit via wheel button inputs. Since the auxiliary display unit is formed on the main body, the relative thickness of the folder can be reduced to make the folder type mobile telephone compact. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a telephone, and more particularly, to a mobile telephone and a control method therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A mobile telephone may be classified into either a bar type mobile telephone where the keypad is exposed, a flip type mobile telephone where a cover is formed to protect the keypad, or a folder type mobile telephone where the main body and a cover body can be folded together. The folder type mobile telephone is especially popular. Because of its folding design, the folder type mobile telephone is compact and lightweight making it convenient to carry. However, in the conventional folder type mobile telephone, the display is located on the main body of the mobile telephone, or on the inner surface of the cover body or folder. Thus, once the folder type mobile telephone is folded or closed, the display is covered and hidden from view. Therefore, when the folder type mobile telephone is closed, the display is difficult to check, making it inconvenient to check, for example, the battery charge state, time of day or whether a message has been received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the problem of the hidden display of the folder type mobile telephone, a second or auxiliary display unit is placed on the outer surface of the cover body or folder such that it is visible when the mobile telephone is closed. With such an auxiliary display unit, displayed information can be viewed even when the folder type mobile telephone is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a conventional folder type mobile telephone includes a main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> hinged at the main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted on a shaft in the hinge. The mobile telephone also includes an auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> located on an outer surface of the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> located on an inner surface of the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Also included in the mobile telephone is a keypad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consisting of number, power and function keys, and a microphone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, all of which are formed on the inner surface of the a body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the mobile telephone. During use, information entered through the keypad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be displayed on the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A speaker <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is also included in the mobile telephone and is located on the inner surface of the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In operation of the conventional mobile telephone, when the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is opened and the mobile telephone is turned on, information such as remaining battery capacity and signal reception strength may be displayed on the main display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The time of any received calls, and whether a message has been left or received may also be displayed on the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Any characters or numbers entered through the keypad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are also displayed. In addition, information such as a date or time may be displayed. Thus, when the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is closed, power to the mobile telephone is turned off and no information is displayed on the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and when the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is opened, power is turned on and information is displayed on the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The mobile telephone can also be placed in standby mode where the folder is closed, but the mobile telephone is not turned off and can still receive calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To augment the inaccessible main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when the folder type mobile telephone is in standby mode, information such as reception strength, messages received, remaining battery capacity, or time can be viewed on the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> located on the outer surface of the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is on the outer surface of the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the conventional folder mobile telephone is more convenient to use because information otherwise only displayed on the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be viewed even when the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Due to the location of the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the conventional mobile telephone, only the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be viewed when the holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is open such as when transmitting a short message or accessing a wireless information network. Thus, in the conventional folder type mobile telephone, since the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are fixed on opposite surfaces of the folder, the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can not be used simultaneously. Such an arrangement of the displays causes an inefficient utilisation of the mobile telephone components. Another problem with the conventional arrangement of the two displays in the conventional folder type mobile telephone is due to the main display unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being respectively attached to the inner surface and the outer surface of the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the folder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must be relatively thick making the mobile telephone less compact. </paragraph>

In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment in accordance with the invention in which the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is used as a conversation input window during information network chatting. The folder type mobile telephone includes a main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for displaying conversation content during the information network chat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for displaying a conversation which has been inputted in the main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is also included in the folder type mobile telephone. At the upper end of the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the most recently inputted conversation content is displayed, That is, in the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the recent conversation input content is displayed at the upper end of an input cursor, and a prior conversation content is displayed at a lower end of the input cursor. In such a configuration, the user selects the conversation content displayed on the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and inputs it into the main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The conversation input content, up to the allocated memory size, is then stored in the memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> during network chatting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, an embodiment in which the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is utilized through the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with the invention. When the user actuates the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the user moves the cursor of the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by scrolling the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> up and down. In response to scrolling the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the conversation contents which have been inputted into the main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> through the keypad and stored in the memory are displayed in input order. During such scrolling, the more recently inputted conversation content is displayed at the upper end of the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the prior inputted conversation content is displayed at the lower end of the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the user scrolls the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> up, the cursor is moved towards the more recent conversation content. When the user scrolls the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> down, the cursor is moved towards the older inputted conversation content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The conversation content at which the cursor is positioned may be entered into the main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> according to selection by the user. For example, after a first user inputs a conversation &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am John Doe&rdquo; through the keypad, and a new person begins to participate in the chat, the first user selects the message &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; displayed on the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the wheel button <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to input it into the main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Thus, instead of inputting a new &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; message through the keypad, the first user can designate a &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; message displayed on the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the previously inputted messages and input it on the main display unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as a response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the wheel button in accordance with the invention. In operation, whenever the wheel button is scrolled through a step, the cursor is moved up or down a line. Accordingly, by scrolling the wheel button, the messages displayed on the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the cursor are scrolled up and down, line by line, in response to the scroll inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The folder type mobile telephone according to the invention has many advantages. For example, the folder type mobile telephone is configured so that the user can view the auxiliary display screen regardless of whether the mobile telephone folder is opened or closed. Thus, accessibility and usefulness of the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is increased. Another advantage is that because the utilization of the auxiliary display unit is improved by installing the wheel button, when a user chats over an information network, keyboard use is reduced by reusing previously inputted messages via wheel button inputs. Another advantage is that searches on an information network are more convenient because a previously searched information network page can be easily searched again via wheel button inputs. Finally, since the auxiliary display unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is attached to the main body of the mobile telephone, the relative thickness of the folder can be reduced, so that the overall size of the mobile telephone is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims.
