<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2001-187048 and No. 2001334345 which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rolling bearing unit for a drive wheel of an automobile and a wheel driving unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The rolling bearing unit for a drive wheel of an automobile and the wheel driving unit according to the present invention are adapted to support a drive wheel to be supported by a suspension device of an independent type, which wheel includes the front wheel of an FF car (a front wheel drive car with a front engine), the rear wheel of an FR car (a rear wheel drive car with a front engine) and an RR car (a rear wheel drive car with a rear engine) and the all wheels of a 4WD car (a four wheel drive car), to be rotatable with respect to the suspension device, and are used for rotating and driving the above drive wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to support the wheel to be rotatable with respect to the suspension device, there are used various kinds of rolling bearing units for a drive wheel in which an outer ring or race and an inner ring or race are combined together to be rotatable through rolling elements. Also, a rolling bearing unit for a drive wheel which is adapted to support the drive wheel with the independent type suspension and to rotate and drive this drive wheel is required to have a structure which can be connected to a wheel side constant velocity joint. This wheel side constant velocity joint is required for transmitting a rotation of a transmission shaft for transmitting a drive force to the above drive wheel smoothly (maintaining uniform speed), irrespective of displacement of the drive wheel or a steering angle applied to this drive wheel. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a structure which is normally embodied according to the prior art, in which a rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the drive wheel and a wheel side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are combined with each other for such a purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In this structure, the rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the drive wheel comprises an outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and an inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are rotatably supported on the inner diameter side of the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through a plurality of rolling elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Out of these members, the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected and fixed to a knuckle (not shown) for constituting a suspension device by the use of a first flange <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> disposed on the outer peripheral surface thereof and is not rotated even when it is used. Also, on the inner peripheral surface of the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, there are provided a pair of outer ring raceways <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so as to rotatably support the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the inner diameter side of this outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> coaxially with the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Out of these members, the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a second flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for supporting the wheel at a position closer to the outer edge of the outer peripheral surface. (The outer side with respect to or in the axial direction indicates the outer side in the width direction of the vehicle when it is assembled in the car and the left side in the drawings except <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This will be the same in the entire present specification.) A first inner ring raceway <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed in an intermediate inner ring element portion on the outer peripheral surface of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is formed with a second inner ring raceway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the outer peripheral surface thereof is fitted and fixed on a small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponding to a fit cylindrical section formed at an axially inner end of the same outer peripheral surface. (The inner side with respect to or in the axial direction indicates the inner side in the width direction of the vehicle when it is assembled in the car and the right side in the drawings except <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This will be the same in the entire present specification.) In addition, in the center of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the wheel side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described above comprises a constant velocity joint outer ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a constant velocity joint inner ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a plurality of balls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The constant velocity joint outer ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed in the axially inner end portion of this spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> coaxially with this spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Outer engagement grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are formed at a plurality of positions in the circumferential direction of the inner peripheral surface of such a constant velocity joint outer ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively in a direction perpendicular to this circumferential direction. The constant velocity joint inner ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided with a second spline hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the center thereof and inner engagement grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at positions which are corresponding to the outer engagement grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the outer peripheral surface thereof, respectively in a direction perpendicular to the circumferential direction. Then, the balls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> described above are disposed respectively between the inner engagement grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer engagement grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be rotatable along these engagement grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a state that they are held by a retainer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The shapes, and the like, of the constituent parts of the constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as those of a known constant velocity joint of a Rzeppa type or a Birfield type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The wheel side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the drive wheel as described above are assembled to each other by inserting the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> mentioned above outward from inside thereof, and then bringing a nut <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> into threadable engagement with a male screw portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is formed in a part protruded from the outer end surface of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the axially outer end portion of the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to be further tightened. In this state, the axially inner end surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is contacted with the axially outer end surface of the constant velocity joint outer ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that this inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not displaced in a direction to be removed from the small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by any means. At the same time, an appropriate preload is applied onto the rolling elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, in a state of being assembled in the suspension device of the car, a male spline portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which is provided in the axially outer end portion of the transmission shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is brought into spline engagement with the second spline hole which is provided in the center of the constant velocity joint inner ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, so that this transmission shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is coupled with the constant velocity joint inner ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to transmit a rotating force therebetween. Also, the axially inner end portion of this transmission shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is coupled and fixed to the central part of a trunnion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) which serves as an output unit of a constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of a tripod type which is provided in an output shaft portion of a differential gear. As a result, the transmission shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is rotated at a constant velocity when the car is running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-5404 is a structure that an inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is fitted on the small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the axially inner end portion of a hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is pressed against a stepped surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is formed by caulking and expanding outward in the radial direction a cylindrical section existing in a part more protruded inward than the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In case of this second example of the conventional structure, preload is applied onto each of the rolling elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the pressing force exerted by the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Note that, in case of the structure disclosed in the above laid-open application, like in the first example of the conventional structure described above, a rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the drive wheel and a wheel side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are coupled to each other by bringing the male screw portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is provided in the outer end portion of the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into threadable engagement and tight fitting with the nut <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A similar structure is also disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-87979. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in the structure that the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is used to fix the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with respect to the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the preload application onto the rolling elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is completed when this caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed. Accordingly, it is also possible to omit the male screw portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the nut <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so as to reduce the size and the weight of the rolling bearing unit for driving the wheel which is comprised of a wheel driving rolling bearing unit and a wheel side constant velocity joint coupled to each other. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows one example of a wheel driving rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, arranged from this angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this wheel driving rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, it is arranged to prevent a spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is inserted in a spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed in the center of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from being drawn therefrom by the use of a stop ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> formed of an elastic material. To this end, an outer locking portion such as a locking stepped portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed in the axially outer end portion of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and an inner locking portion such as a locking groove <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the axially outer end portion of the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, respectively. Then, the stop ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is formed of a wire rod of spring steel in a split ring shape with a split at a portion thereof and whose diameter is elastically expandable or contractible is extended over between the locking stepped unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the locking groove <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As described above, it is possible to reduce the size and the weight of the rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for driving the wheel by using the structure in which the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is prevented from being drawn out from the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by the stop ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for the drive wheel is coupled to the wheel side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to each other, so that the male screw portion and the nut may be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,490,732 is a structure that the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is fitted on the small diameter stepped portion in the axially inner end portion of a hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is pressed against a stepped surface of the small diameter stepped portion by the use of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is formed by caulking and expanding outward in the radial direction a cylindrical section existing in a part more protruded inward than the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In case of this disclosed structure, the hardness of the caulking and the dimensions of each constituent parts to allow the caulking work are specified. Note that, in the above patent publication, there is also disclosed a drawing in which a boarder position between a thicker cylindrical section and a thinner cylindrical section on the axially inner end portion of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is positioned more outward in the axial direction than the axially outer end position of a chamfered portion which is formed on the inner ring fixed to the hub at a point of intersection between the inner peripheral surface with the axially inner end surface suppressed by the caulking portion. However, in this patent publication, a structure having a spline at the center of the hub is not disclosed and the dimensions of each of the constituent parts of the hub for minimizing the contraction of a female spline at the axially inner end of the hub due to the caulking are not specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, disclosed in European Patent No. 1063437 is a structure that the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is fitted on the small diameter stepped portion on the axially inner end portion of a hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is pressed against the stepped surface of the small diameter stepped portion by the use of a caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is formed by caulking and expanding outward in the radial direction a cylindrical section existing in a part more protruded outward than the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In this publication, the position at which the caulking work of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>starts is located more outward in the axial direction than the axially outer end position of the chamfered portion which is formed at a point of intersection between the inner peripheral surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> fixed to the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with the axially inner end surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> suppressed by the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so as to control the axial force to be applied on the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>due to the caulking. However, in this publication, the dimensions of each of the constituent parts of the hub for minimizing the contraction of a female spline at the inner end of the hub due to the caulking work are not specified. Note that in this publication, the thickness of the spline portion is not specified at all. Also in this publication, the position at which the caulking work starts is defined. However, this position is on the boarder position between a thick part and a thin part of the hub, and has the same structure as that disclosed in the above U.S. Pat. No. 540732. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for driving the wheel as described above is combined with the transmission shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the differential side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to constitute a driving unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for a wheel, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Out of these members, the differential side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is coupled to an output portion of an unrepresented differential gear in a state that it is assembled in the car. Of the transmission shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the axially inner end portion is coupled to the basic end portion of the trunnion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which serves as an output portion of the differential side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, while the axially outer end portion is coupled to the constant velocity joint inner ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which serves as an input portion of the wheel side constant velocity joint <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. The rotating force is transmitted by such a driving unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for the wheel from the output portion of the differential gear to the drive wheel supported by the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thereby rotating and driving this drive wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In case of such a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> above in which the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fixed with respect to the hubs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>by the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the cost can be reduced by omitting the male screw portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the nut <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Moreover, in this case, the size and the weight of the wheel driving rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and consequently, those of the wheel driving unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can also be reduced. Out of these members, the wheel driving rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided closer to the wheel than a spring assembled in the suspension device to render a so-called unsprung load, so that a slight reduction of the weight can contribute to enhancement of the running performance centering on a riding comfort or running stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is required to sufficiently maintain the strength of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for fixing the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the hubs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>for constituting the rolling bearing units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for the drive wheel, which is to be used for a long time. Accordingly, a load required for forming this caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> becomes considerably large even when such a method is employed in which a load to be applied during the processings such as a rocking caulking can be suppressed to be comparatively low. Thus, in this case, such load is applied as a thrust load which is directed outward in the axial direction onto the inner end portions of the hubs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. As a result, according to the experiments conducted by the present inventor, it has been found that, if no counter measure is taken, a part of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (particularly, a part closer to the axially inner end) formed at the center of each of the hubs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is deformed, though slightly, inward in the radial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> More specifically, hitherto, when the cylindrical section provided in the axially inner end portion of each of the hubs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is processed to be the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, since this cylindrical section is caulked and expanded outward in the radial direction, the axially inner end of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is positioned in the vicinity of this caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is assumed to be deformed outward in the radial direction. However, the thrust load applied during the processing of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is large, as described above, so that an influence of a lateral distortion on this thrust load becomes larger than conventionally thought. As a result, the axially inner end portion of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is positioned in the vicinity of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is deformed inward in the radial direction, conversely, according to the findings of the present inventor. In any case, when even a part of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is deformed inward in the radial direction, it becomes difficult to insert the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that an assembling work of the rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for driving the wheel is difficult to be conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the insertion of the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in spite of the deformation of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it can be considered to sufficiently expand the inner diameter of this spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be larger than the outer diameter of the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, or to process the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the second time after the processing of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Out of them, expansion of the inner diameter of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may result in an increase of a backlash in a spline engagement portion between this spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which may undesirably cause a conspicuous foreign sound or noise during when the automobile is driven. In addition, re-processing of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may cause an increase of the manufacturing cost of the rolling bearing units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for the drive wheel, as another undesirable effect. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show the first embodiment according to the present invention. Note that the present invention is characterized in that, when a caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed in an axially inner end portion of a hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>in order to press the axially inner end surface of an inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is fitted on a small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the inner end portion of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, much consideration is given to the form of this hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>in order to prevent deformation of a spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is formed at the center of this hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. The basic arrangements and functions of the other portions are the same as those in the second example of the conventional structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> above, or those in the improvements on this second example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the identical parts are given the same reference numerals and symbols and redundant description will be omitted or simplified. In the following, the present invention will be described centering on the characteristic arrangements thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The inner peripheral surface and the axially inner end surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed to be smoothly continues by a chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which has a convex arc-shaped cross section. However, for the reason in processing, the inner peripheral surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is ground after a curved surface of the convex arc-shaped section, which is to be formed as this chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, is machined or shaped by lathe, so that a tangent at the axially outer end position of this chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is usually inclined by 10 to 20 degrees with respect to the central axis of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the inclination of the tangent at the axially outer end position is discontinuous. The inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed with a stepped portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at a part in the axially inner end portion of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> positioned radially outside the chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, along the entire periphery thereof, and the thickness of this chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the radial direction is made smaller than that of a part more outward than the chamfered portion. With this arrangement, it is possible to prevent the shape of the second inner ring raceway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed on the outer peripheral surface of an intermediate portion of this inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from being distorted, in spite of a large force applied outward in the radial direction on the axially inner end portion of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> upon formation of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In order to form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> formed in the axially inner end portion of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is arranged to have a cylindrical outer peripheral surface and a tapered inner peripheral surface slightly inclined (for example, the generating line is inclined with respect to the central axis by about 0 to 5 degrees) in a direction in which the inner diameter becomes larger at a position closer to the axially inner end opening. It is suffice for the outer peripheral surface of the above cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> if it takes a substantially cylindrical surface form. This surface may be formed as a tapered surface slightly inclined. When this surface is a tapered surface, the direction of inclination thereof is not counted (the surface may be inclined in any direction). Note that, in the illustrated structure, a stepped portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> having a concave arc-shaped cross section is formed at a boarder position between the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the outer peripheral surface of a small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for fitting the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> thereon, so as to provide a slight difference (of about 0.01 to 0.5 mm, for example) between the both outer peripheral surfaces. This stepped portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is provided to serve as the reference point for deformation when the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is plastically deformed outward in the radial direction in order to form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so as to smoothly process the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to make the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> without generating defects such as a crack or a large void. To this end, it is arranged such that the axial position of the boarder position between the stepped portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the small diameter stepped portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> substantially matches the axial position of the axially outer end position of the chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Also, the outer periphery of the tip end surface (axially inner end surface) of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is chamfered so that damages such as a crack are hardly generated on this outer periphery, in spite of the force in the direction of tension applied on this outer periphery in the course of the above processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in a conical concave shape is formed between the outer end portion in the axial direction of the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as described above and the inner end portion in the axial direction of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed in the center of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. This inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> takes a conical concave shape which is inclined in a direction in which the diameter thereof becomes larger at a position more inward in the axial direction. The generating line of this inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is inclined more largely with respect to the central axis of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>than the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (for example, by 20 to 70 degrees, and more preferably 25 to 65 degrees). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present invention is characterized by satisfying the following condition: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L&gt;</italic></highlight>30&middot;(<highlight><italic>B/A</italic></highlight>)&minus;16, </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> where a distance between a boarder position between the inclined surface portion and the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section and the axially outer end portion of the chamfered portion is Lmm (which is a positive value when the boarder position is axially outside of the axially outer end portion of the chamfered portion), the thinnest part of the spline portion of the hub ((the outer diameter of the cylindrical section&minus;the diameter of a dedendum circle (that is, groove bottom circle) of the spline)/2) is Amm, and the thickness of the hub at the boarder position between said inclined surface portion and the inner peripheral surface of said cylindrical section is Bmm. Note that at the boarder position between the inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the axially outer end portion of the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, there is often provided a continuous portion having an arc-shaped cross section called the corner R, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, or a concave groove called an escape, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. In such a case, the boarder position &agr; is a position at which a line extended from the generating line of the inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> intersects with a line extended from the generating line of the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Note that, in the illustrated structure, the inner end portion in the axial direction of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the axially outer end portion of the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are formed to be continuous through the inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the continuous conical concave surface form, with the angle of inclination unchanged. On the other hand, it is also possible to form another structure in which, for instance, a cylindrical surface portion having the diameter larger than that of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and smaller than the inner diameter of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed between the inner end portion in the axial direction of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the axially outer end portion of the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, so that the inclination of the inclined surface portion having the conical concave surface form is not uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Also, the inclination surface portion may be formed as a surface perpendicular to the central axis of rotation of the hub. When a plurality of cylindrical surfaces are formed in the inner end portion of the hub in the axial direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the position of intersection between an inclined surface portion extended inward in the axial direction from the inner end in the axial direction of a female spline portion of the hub and the axially outermost cylindrical surface is defined as the boarder position &agr;, and the thickness of the hub at this boarder as Bmm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to the rolling bearing unit for the drive wheel of the present invention having the above structure, a spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>) can be easily inserted into the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> without particularly enlarging the inner diameter of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or re-processing the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after formation of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the above inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is provided between the axially outer end portion of the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for forming the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the axially inner end portion of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so as to appropriately control the boarder position &agr; between the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the inclined surface portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in accordance with the positional relationship with the axially outer end portion &bgr; of the chamfered portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> provided on the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (L&gE;30&middot;(B/A)&minus;16). As a result, deformation of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be suppressed to the minimum in spite of the load applied on the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>when the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is plastically deformed in order to form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With respect to this point, experiments were made with hub units of various dimensions which were made as trial products, in order to obtain the optimal dimensions to minimize the deformation of the female spline of the hub by caulking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, hub units each having the inner ring with the inner diameter &phgr;D (the outer diameter of the hub) of &phgr;30 mm to &phgr;48 mm were produced as trial units of the hub units which are normally used in cars for private and commercial uses, and subjected to caulking experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows results of measurement of an amount of radially inward displacement of the axially inner end portion of a female spline at the axially inner end of the hub after caulking (hereinafter called the &ldquo;contraction amount&rdquo;). The size D of the sample 1 is &phgr;30 mm, the size D of the sample 2 is &phgr;40 mm, and the size D of the sample 3 is &phgr;48 mm. However, according to the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, though the sizes D of the respective samples are different from each other, the graph curves of the samples 1 to 3 can be approximated to be on the same line. All of the values for B/A of the samples 1 to 3 turn to 0.6, and when the caulking experiments were conducted with trial products of the sample 4 and the sample 5 having different values for B/A, the sample 4 and the sample 5 are represented by different graph curves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is found from the above description that a curve of the contraction amount of the spline depends on L and B/A. With respect to the definitions of A, B and L, the distance between the boarder position between the inclined surface portion and the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section and the axially outer end position of the chamfered portion is Lmm (which takes a positive value when the boarder position is disposed in the axial direction, outside of the axially outer end position of the chamfered portion), the smallest thickness of the spline portion of the hub ((the outer diameter size of the cylindrical section&minus;the diameter of the groove bottom circle (or dedendum circle) of the spline)/2) is Amm, and the thickness of the hub at the boarder position between the inclined surface portion and the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical section is Bmm, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> According to the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is found that the contraction amount of the axially inner end of the spline is drastically decreased when the dimension L exceeds a specific value, irrespective of a value of B/A. The point at which the contraction amount starts to drastically decrease is indicated in the graph by &ldquo;the hatching leftward down&rdquo;. It is also found that the relation between this point (dimension L) and a value for B/A is expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L&equals;</italic></highlight>30&middot;(<highlight><italic>B/A</italic></highlight>)&minus;16. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Consequently, though B/A-may be required to have a different value, depending on the size of the hub unit, it is possible to minimize the contraction of the axially inner end of the female spline of the hub if design is made to satisfy the following condition: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L&gt;</italic></highlight>30&middot;(<highlight><italic>B/A</italic></highlight>)&minus;16. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As described above, if the distance L is set within the above range, an amount of deformation of the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> upon formation of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be suppressed to the minimum. For this reason, it is possible to suppress a backlash in the spline engagement portion between the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the minimum without subjecting the spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to re-processing after processing of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> even if the inner diameter of this spline hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not set unnecessarily large with respect to the outer diameter size of the spline shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The inner ring and the hub prior to the caulking are usually fitted to each other with an interference of about 10 to 35 mm therebetween. However, it is found that, if the caulking process is conducted when a value for B/A is 0.8, a gap is generated between the fit surfaces between the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. When the gap is generated between the fit surfaces, a creep (slip) of the inner ring is easily generated during the driving, which phenomenon is required to be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It is found that such a phenomenon occurs only on condition that a value for B/A is large (exceeding 0.6) and that L exceeds 5 mm even if B/A is not more than 0.6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in case of B/A&gt;0.6 and in case of L&gt;5, it is possible to prevent a gap from being generated between the fit surfaces if a metal mold for caulking is brought into contact not only with the end surface, but also with the inner diameter surface to carry out the caulking work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of the present invention. In case of the structure of the first embodiment described above, the first inner ring raceway <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed directly on the outer peripheral surface of the intermediate portion of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. However, in case of the second embodiment, a separate inner ring element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which has a first inner ring raceway <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed on the outer peripheral surface thereof is fitted on the intermediate portion of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Then, the axially outer end surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which has a second inner ring raceway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed on the outer peripheral surface thereof is caused to abut on the axially inner end surface of the inner ring element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Then, by the use of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) which is formed by plastically deforming the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> formed in the axially inner end portion of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>outward in the radial direction, the inner ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the inner ring element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are fixed to the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. The arrangements and the functions of the other parts in the second embodiment are the same as those in the first embodiment described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Since the rolling bearing unit for the drive wheel and the wheel driving unit according to the present invention are arranged and function as described above, the structure which can contribute to the enhancement of the running performance in a small size and with a light weight can be realized at a lower cost. </paragraph>
