<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With reference to the number reference of the above mentioned figures, the inhaler device, according to the present invention, which has been generally indicated by the reference number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, comprises an inhaler nosepiece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, including a flange <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, having a peg <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which can be engaged in a corresponding hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed in an inhaler body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided with a longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in which can engage a cross tooth <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the peg <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a bottom ring-like recess, not specifically shown, in which the tooth <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to engage the peg <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in said hole, by causing the tooth <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to pass through the slot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and, upon achieving the bottom, it is possible to fully rotate the peg <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in its hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby also rotating the inhaler nosepiece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with respect to the inhaler body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The inhaler nosepiece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be locked in its closed condition, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, by a snap type of locking means, including a hook portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the flange <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a small ridge, not shown, for engaging a corresponding ridge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> formed inside a latching recess <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, defined in the inhaler body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The inhaler body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is moreover provided with a recess for the capsule, said recess being upward opened and communicating with the outside through a perforated plate or grid <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, included in the inhaler nosepiece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at said flange <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and designed for separating the capsule recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> from the duct <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the nosepiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A capsule <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be engaged in said recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, said capsule being of a per se known type and adapted to be perforated to allow the drug contents held therein to be easily accessed, said perforating operation being performed by any suitable perforating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the disclosed embodiment, the perforating means comprise a pair of perforating needles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which can transversely slide as counter-urged by resilient elements comprising, in this embodiment, coil springs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, coaxial with said perforating needles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and operating between respective abutment element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, rigid with the inhaler body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a hollow push-button element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The perforating needles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are similar to hypodermic needles and have a beveled tip, for facilitating said perforating needles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in perforating the coating of the capsule <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The operation of the inhaler device according to the present invention is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the open condition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> capsule is engaged in the capsule recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the nosepiece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is snap closed on the inhaler body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> By pressing the push-button elements <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the perforating needles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will perforate the capsule <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thereby its contents, usually a fine powder, will be communicated with the capsule recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By applying suction on the nosepiece <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an air flow will be generated which, coming from the outside through the holes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, will enter the capsule recess, thereby mixing with the capsule contents and, passing through the grid <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and duct <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will allow the products to be inhaled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the invention fully achieves the intended aim and objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In fact, the invention provides an inhaler device which is very simple construction-wise and can operate in a very satisfactory manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the inhaler device according to the invention is the specifically designed configuration of the perforating needles which can be assimilated, as stated, to hypodermic needles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Since this type of needle presents a very small resistance against perforation and a very accurate operation, it is possible to use needles having a comparatively large diameter, without damaging the capsule, thereby providing a very simple perforating operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The use of small number of perforating needles, only two in the preferred embodiment, allows to reduce, the perforated cross section being the same, the contact surface between the needle and capsule, with a consequent reduction of the friction and of the problems affecting the prior inhalers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In practicing the invention, the used materials, and their size and shapes, can be any, depending on the requirements. </paragraph>
