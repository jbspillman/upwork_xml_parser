<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane salt of structural formula I above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The compositions in accordance with the invention are suitably in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories. The compositions are intended for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual, or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Formulation of the compositions according to the invention can conveniently be effected by methods known from the art, for example, as described in <highlight><italic>Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, </italic></highlight>17<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>ed., 1995. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The dosage regimen is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. An ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian, or clinician can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Oral dosages of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 mg per kg of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day, and most preferably 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A medicament typically contains from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, preferably, from about 1 mg to about 100 mg of active ingredient. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Advantageously, the salt of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, the salt of the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the methods of the present invention, the salt herein described in detail can form the active ingredient, and is typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients or carriers (collectively referred to herein as &lsquo;carrier&rsquo; materials) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups and the like, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug component can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of the tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethyl (&ldquo;TRIS&rdquo;) salt of formula I, which process comprises reacting 3-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-9-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-&lsqb;1,8&rsqb;-naphthyridin-2-yl)-nonanoic acid of structural formula IV below:

The process is carried out generally at about 0&deg; C. to about 100&deg; C., and preferably at about 20&deg; to about 60&deg; C. Generally, the organic solvent is a linear or branched C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or a mixture thereof. In one embodiment, the solvent used for the salt formation is a mixture of methanol and ethanol. Salt crystallization is then effected by adding a replacement solvent, such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, and removing the lower boiling alcohol mixture by distillation while maintaining the volume of the replacement solvent constant. In one embodiment the replacement solvent is isopropyl acetate. Crystallization of the salt can be accelerated by seeding the alcohol solution with crystals of the authentic &ldquo;TRIS&rdquo; salt prior to solvent replacement with ethyl or isopropyl acetate. The &ldquo;TRIS&rdquo; salt is then isolated and purified by conventional procedures, such as by filtration and drying. </paragraph>
