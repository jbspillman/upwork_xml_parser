<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Document FR-A-2 792 264 describes such an irreversible adjustment mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> That known mechanism makes it possible to make continuous adjustments to an element driven by a coupling shaft fitted in the outlet member, by effecting one or more back and forth &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; movements: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> either over the first angular sector starting from the rest position of the inlet member, to displace the element driven by the outlet member in a certain direction; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> or over the second angular sector, to move the element driven by the outlet member in the opposite direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For example, that mechanism can be used in particular to adjust the height of the seat proper of a vehicle seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> That known mechanism is quite satisfactory, but it has appeared that it is desirable to improve the guiding of the coupling shaft which is secured to the outlet member, and to simplify fixing the inlet member to the actuating member. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<heading lvl="1">MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the various figures, the same references are used to designate elements that are identical or similar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a vehicle seat which comprises a seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> carried by a seat proper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> itself mounted on the floor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the vehicle, e.g. by means of longitudinal runners <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The seat proper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the runners <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via a raising mechanism that is known per se and that is not shown, making it possible to adjust the height of the seat proper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This raising mechanism is driven by an irreversible adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, itself driven by an actuating member such as a control lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (or a handle of some other shape) mounted to pivot about a transverse horizontal pivot axis X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is urged resiliently towards a rest position N in which said lever may, for example, be disposed substantially horizontally. Starting from this rest position, the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be moved: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> in a first angular direction <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, over a first angular sector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> defined between the rest position N and a first abutment position B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> in a second angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, over a second angular sector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> defined between the rest position N and a second abutment position B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the irreversible adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a casing made up of two sheet metal cheek plates <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> respectively constituting a cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that are assembled together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In addition, the adjustment mechanism further includes an inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which may be a metal annular inlet cam whose outside shape is substantially triangular with rounded vertices constituting three projections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> projecting radially outwards (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a peripheral ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which includes the projections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and which is connected to a central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> centered on the axis X via three bridges <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> separated angularly from one another by three recesses <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a tapped hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which makes it possible to fix the above-mentioned lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be fitted over the central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and over the bridges <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the inlet member that project through the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the casing. This interfitting is made possible by the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> being provided with a central recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which engages snugly over the central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the inlet member, and with radial recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which engage snugly over the bridges <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the inlet member. In addition, the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided with a central hole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>through which a single screw <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>passes that is screwed into the tapped hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the inlet member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, to limit the friction between the inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a low-friction washer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>made of plastic may optionally be interposed axially between the ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the inlet member and said cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with a central recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through which the central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the bridges <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> project, and said cover is further provided with catches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that project radially towards the central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, between the bridges <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and that are folded back axially towards the inside of the casing through the recesses <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in said inlet member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The utility of these catches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> further includes an intermediate metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or driver which is mounted to rotate about the axis X and which comprises a ring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> centered on the pivot axis X (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. This ring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has an inside cylindrical surface or abutment cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is circularly symmetrical about the axis X, and said ring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is disposed around the ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the inlet member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Together with the inlet member, the abutment cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>radially defines a hollow intermediate space <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which, on either side of each projection <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the inlet member, forms first and second wedge-shaped zones <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that diverge in respective ones of the first and second directions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a base <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed integrally with the ring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the side opposite from the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, this base <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> further being provided with three pairs of axial fingers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Each of these pairs of axial fingers comprises first and second axial fingers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that extend towards the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the casing parallel to the axis X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the intermediate annular space <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, three fixed axial fingers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are disposed that may be constituted in particular by tongues cut out from the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the casing and folded back axially towards the inside of said casing. When the mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is in the rest position, the projections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are disposed in register with respective ones of the three fixed axial fingers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, the adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> also includes a thick metal ring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> secured to the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which ring is interposed axially between the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the casing and the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This ring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has an annular shape centered on the axis X, and it has an inside cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or blocking cylindrical surface that is circularly symmetrical about said axis X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> By way of non-limiting example, it is possible to secure said fixed ring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by means of projecting portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that project radially outwards from the ring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and that fit into notches <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided in an annular side wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the side wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is extended radially outwards by a collar <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The collar may optionally be provided with an outside set of teeth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and it may advantageously be provided with indentations <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> projecting radially inwards, e.g. with three such indentations (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the annular side wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is advantageously crimped onto the collar <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the side wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cover is engaged over the collar <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, preferably by forming two beads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> disposed axially on either side of said collar to fix the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> axially to the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In addition, the side wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is also pushed back radially inwards against the collar <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>so as to form inwardly-projecting projections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that penetrate into the indentations <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in said collar, while preventing the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from turning relative to the base about the axis X. This prevention from turning about the axis X is supplemented by the outside set of teeth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the collar rubbing against the side wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cover and/or optionally by the teeth of the set of teeth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> penetrating in part into said side wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Inside the fixed ring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, an outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> or outlet cam is disposed that is internally provided with a fluted hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or the like in which a coupling shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is force fitted, the coupling shaft being provided with a sprocket <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for driving the raising mechanism making it possible to adjust the height of the seat proper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are mounted to rotate about the axis X, the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> being guided in rotation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> firstly by means of a first bearing formed by an axial neck <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> that is cylindrical and circularly symmetrical, that is centered on the axis X, and that is part of the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the casing, the neck <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> receiving substantially without any clearance a cylindrical bearing surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at the periphery of the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the sprocket <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> secondly by a second bearing <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> formed in this example by a guide ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that is made of plastic or of some other material, that is substantially cylindrical and circularly symmetrical about the axis X, and that is engaged by force between the catches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the casing so as to be secured to said casing, the guide ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> receiving a cylindrical bearing surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed at one end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> situated opposite from the sprocket <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the guide ring is further provided with a peripheral collar <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is disposed inside the ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the inlet member and that rests on the base <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In addition, an elastomer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may advantageously be engaged around the guide ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which elastomer ring is clamped radially between said guide ring and a circular inside recess <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the base <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, centered on the axis X. The elastomer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> serves to brake the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> relative to the casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to avoid random lost motion phenomena when actuating the mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as explained in above-mentioned Document FR-2 792 264. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the elastomer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is retained around the guide ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by means of three hooks <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are formed at the periphery of said guide ring facing the collar <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the elastomer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> being disposed between said collar and said hooks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, in the particular example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the elastomer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not in contact with the guide ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at the hooks <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, but the elastomer ring is in contact with said guide ring over all of the remainder of the periphery of said guide ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In addition, the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is externally provided with three radial fingers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which project outwards until they come into contact with the blocking cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and which are angularly spaced apart from one another by 120 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Each finger <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is defined laterally by first and second thrust faces <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which face respectively in the second angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and in the first angular direction <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The periphery of the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is also provided with three setback zones, each of which is in the form of a central flat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which, in the vicinity of the two adjacent projecting fingers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, is extended by two rounded zones <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having circular arcuate shapes substantially centered on the axis X. Together with the blocking cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, each flat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defines first and second wedge-shaped spaces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> that diverge respectively in the first angular direction <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and in the second angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The above-described mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> operates by means of the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> a drive stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which connects the inlet cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> a locking stage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which connects the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outlet cam <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the drive stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes three pairs of first and second rigid wedging bodies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which, in this example, are steel balls or rollers, disposed in respective ones of the intermediate annular spaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the first and second wedge-shaped zones <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are situated on either side of each projection <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A compression spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is interposed between each first wedging body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the second wedging body <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> corresponding to the adjacent projection <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the inlet member, the compression spring also being received in the intermediate annular space <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so as to urge the wedging body towards the wedge-shaped zones <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the actuating lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is moved in either of the angular directions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> away from its rest position N, the projections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the inlet body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> block the first wedging bodies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> hard against the abutment surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the lever is actuated in the first angular direction <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and they block the second wedging bodies <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> against the abutment surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the lever is actuated in the second angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The inlet member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> then drives the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, after the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has traveled with a very small mount of angular lost motion, which lost motion may be about 1&deg;. During this movement, every other wedging body remains in abutment against the fixed fingers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When the user releases the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> after each occasion on which it is actuated, said lever is returned to the rest position N by means of the springs <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the drive stage. During this return movement back towards the rest position, the wedging bodies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that have been displaced by the inlet cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> return towards their initial positions with said inlet cam, while rubbing against the inside surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the ring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. However, this rubbing does not induce any movement of the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> because of the presence of the elastomer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the above-described drive stage may optionally be replaced by a ratchet drive mechanism, or by any other mechanism operating by back and forth motion of the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the locking stage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes three pairs of first and second clamping bodies <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (e.g. steel balls or rollers) which are disposed in respective ones of the first and second wedge-shaped spaces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and which are urged apart by compression springs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> so that, in the rest position, the clamping bodies <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> hold the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> stationary by wedging against the blocking surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition, the first and second clamping bodies <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each pair of clamping bodies that is disposed between two radial fingers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the outlet cam are flanked by a pair of first and second axial fingers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, with some angular clearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> More precisely: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> each first axial finger <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disposed between one of the first clamping bodies <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the corresponding second thrust face <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, said first finger <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a first abutment face adapted to move the corresponding first clamping body; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> each second axial finger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is disposed between one of the second clamping bodies <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and the corresponding first thrust face <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, said second finger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> having a second abutment face adapted to move the corresponding second clamping body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is actuated by a user, and when it causes the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to pivot as explained above, e.g. in the second angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from its rest position N (i.e. over the second angular sector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), the abutment face of each finger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves the corresponding second clamping body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the second angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby releasing the second clamping body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> After the second clamping bodies <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> have been released, the first clamping bodies <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> urge the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> under the effect of the springs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> This urging may be sufficient to turn the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, in particular when the mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is operating empty, i.e. without being subjected to any opposing torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is operating under a load, the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pivoting causes the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to turn in the angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> only when the first axial fingers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> come into contact with the second thrust faces <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the outlet member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> At the end of actuation of the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, when said lever returns towards its rest position N, the intermediate member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remains stationary as explained above, so that the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> remain stationary. If the user effects several &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; movements over the second angular sector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the outlet member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are thus turned a plurality of times successively in the same angular direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The device would operate in the same way, mutatis mutandis, if the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> were actuated repeatedly over the first angular sector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
