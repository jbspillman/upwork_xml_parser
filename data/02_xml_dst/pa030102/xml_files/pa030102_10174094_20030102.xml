<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In order to drive a PC and a cam-coder communicating with each other by adopting a Bluetooth technique to carry out mutual authentication processing, the user presses an authentication button of the PC and an authentication button of the cam-coder simultaneously. An authentication program of the PC detects an on time to turn on the authentication button of the PC and an off time to turn off the button. Likewise, an authentication program of the cam-coder detects an on time to turn on the authentication button of the cam-coder and an off time to turn off the button. The detected on and off times are exchanged between the PC and the cam-coder. If a difference between the on times and a difference between the off times are each found to be within a predetermined range, a result of the mutual authentication processing is considered to be positive. In this way, the mutual authentication processing can be carried out with ease. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an information-processing apparatus, an information-processing method, an information-processing system, a recording medium and a program. More particularly, the present invention relates to an information-processing apparatus, an information-processing method, an information-processing system, a recording medium and a program that make mutual authentication among electronic apparatuses easy to carry out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A short-distance wireless communication technology using Bluetooth for implementing communication among electronic apparatuses has been becoming more popular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology using a 2.45 GHz-frequency band. Distances covered by Bluetooth are up to about 10 m. As a similar communication method, infrared-ray communication exists. However, Bluetooth can be used to communicate through an obstruction since it is wireless communication. From this point of view, Bluetooth offers a merit that the infrared-ray communication does not have. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Examples of the Bluetooth wireless communication are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</cross-reference>. The Bluetooth wireless communication allows information to be exchanged between a PC (Personal Computer) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, between a portable phone <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a handy cam-coder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, between the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a portable information communication terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C and between a portable personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the portable information communication terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Through the Bluetooth wireless connection requiring specially no wires, it is possible to transfer data from the portable information communication terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the portable personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> located at a different room. It is also possible to connect the portable phone <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> placed in a pocket of a user&apos;s clothes to the handy cam-coder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and transmit an image recorded in the handy cam-coder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to another electronic apparatus by way of the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid communication malfunctions, incorrect connections or data leakages in data transfers during communications between such electronic apparatuses, each of the apparatuses carries out mutual authentication processing in a first communication. At that time, the user enters a password such as a string of alphanumeric characters to each of the electronic apparatuses if necessary to let the apparatus carry out authentication processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> By referring to a flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the following description explains authentication processing carried out initially in a communication shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> between the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the flowchart begins with a step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at which the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> determines whether or not a password for identifying a user has been entered by an input unit such as a keyboard. The personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also referred to hereafter as the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In Bluetooth specifications, a password for identifying a user is called a PIN (Personal Identification Number). If a password for identifying a user has not been entered, the determination is made repeatedly till such a password is entered. If a password for identifying a user is judged entered, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> By the same token, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> carries out similar processing at a step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At the next step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates a random number R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and transmits it to the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, at the next step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> computes a common key E<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, PIN, BDADDR-Cam) from the random number R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the PIN and a BDADDR-Cam (Blue-tooth Device Address for Cam-coder) by using a predetermined function E<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The BDADDR-Cam is a unique number assigned to the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for identifying the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The BDADDR-Cam is selected as a number for identifying an electronic apparatus specified by the user as an apparatus to be connected to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, the electronic apparatus is the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> At a step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> computes a common key CK (&equals;E<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>(R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, PIN, BDADDR-Cam)) from the random number R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the PIN and the BDADDR-Cam by applying the same function E<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> used by the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> then transmits the common key CK to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a response to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> At a step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates a random number R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for authentication and transmits it to the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then, at the next step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> computes a password A (&equals;E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CK, BDADDR-Cam)) from the random number R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the common key CK and the BDADDR-Cam by using a function E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> At that time, at a step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> computes a password A&prime; (&equals;E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CK, BDADDR-Cam)) from the random number R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmitted from the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the common key and the BDADDR-Cam by applying the same function E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> used by the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> then transmits the password A&prime; to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> At a step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the password A computed by itself matches the password A&prime; received from the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If the result of the determination indicates that the password A matches the password A&prime;, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at which the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> notifies the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that the passwords match each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At a step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives a notice from the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At the next step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> examines the notice to determine whether or not the notice indicates that the password A matches the password A&prime;. As described above, at the step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> notified the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that the passwords match each other. In this case, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at which the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generates a random number R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for authentication and transmits the random number R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, at the next step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> computes a password B (&equals;E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CK, BDADDR-PC)) from the random number R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the common key CK and a BDADDR-PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At a step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> computes a password B&prime; (&equals;E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CK, BDADDR-PC)) from the random number R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmitted from the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the common key CK and a BDADDR-PC by using the function E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> Then, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the password B&prime; to the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> At a step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the password B matches the password B&prime;. If the outcome of the determination indicates that the password B matches the password B&prime;, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> at which a positive result of authentication is recognized and, at the same time, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is notified that the password B matches the password B&prime;. At a step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the notice, recognizing the positive result of authentication verifying that the password B matches the password B&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If the outcome of the determination made at the step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates that the password A does not match the password A&prime;, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at which the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> notifies the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that the password A does not match the password A&prime; and then ends the processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In this case, at the step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives the notice indicating that the password A does not match the password A&prime;. Thus, the outcome of the determination made at the next step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> indicates that the password A does not match the password A&prime;. In this case, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ends the processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If the outcome of the determination made at the step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> indicates that the password B does not match the password B&prime;, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at which the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> determines that the result of authentication was negative. In this case, the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> notifies the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that the password B does not match the password B&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Then, at the second and subsequent connections, the electronic apparatuses which are to be communicated with each other carry out automatic authentication by using the passwords A and B stored during the first authentication processing as well as the common key CK generated at the first connection so that the processing carried out by the users to enter passwords can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the configuration described above, however, there occurs only a slight problem when the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to a fixed communication partner such as the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or a wireless access point in a LAN (Local Area Network). In a case where the communication partner is changed, on the other hand, there is raised a problem that it is necessary to enter a password each time the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected with another electronic apparatus serving as a new communication partner. As a result, the processing becomes cumbersome. An example of the case where the communication partner is changed is a case in which application software or the like executed on the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> temporarily exchanges information such as picture data with another electronic apparatus and, with a next timing, must change the communication partner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic view showing the configuration of an embodiment implementing a wireless communication system to which the present invention is applied. It should be noted that, in descriptions referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and subsequent figures, components corresponding to those employed in the conventional system are denoted by the same reference numerals as the conventional system and their explanation is omitted appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> By using the Bluetooth technique described above, the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are capable of exchanging data with each other through wireless communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the configurations of the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to which the present invention is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> First of all, the configuration of the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is explained. A microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> employed in the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a ROM (Read-Only Memory) and a RAM (Random-Access Memory) . The CPU properly loads programs from the ROM to the RAM, and executes the programs to carry out various kinds of processing. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> controls the entire operation of the personal computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also loads a variety of programs, mainly an authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>from a hard disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the internal RAM through a bus <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to carry out various kinds of processing. In addition, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> loads a variety of programs from a magnetic disk <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, an optical disk <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, a magnetic optical disk <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or a semiconductor memory <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to the internal RAM through the bus <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to carry out various kinds of processing. If necessary, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also writes variety of programs or data to the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the optical disk <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the magnetic optical disk <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or the semiconductor memory <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The magnetic disk <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the optical disk <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the magnetic optical disk <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or the semiconductor memory <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is mounted on a drive <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> The hard disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used for storing a variety of programs and data required in execution of the programs. A representative of the programs is the authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>executed to carry out authentication processing with respect to another electronic apparatus such as the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is connected via a communication unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Controlled by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a display unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is implemented by a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or the like. The display unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> displays a variety of processing results and operation windows to be described later. The authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>detects a timing with which an authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is pressed. The authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also detects a timing with which an operation to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is completed. The detected timings are compared with similar timings received from the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by considering a difference in reference time between the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Authentication processing is then carried out in dependence on a result of comparison. The reference time of the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is generated from a real-time-clock signal not shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> An input unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a keyboard and a mouse, which are operated by the user for entering a variety of commands. The communication unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has the so-called Bluetooth configuration for exchanging various kinds of data with another electronic apparatus such as mainly the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through wireless communications on the basis of a command issued by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is operated at the same time as an authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> provided on the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be authenticated in first authentication processing prescribed in the Bluetooth standard. That is to say, if the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are turned on or off with the same timing, the authentication processing carried out accordingly produces a positive result. The operations of the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> will be described later in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Next, the configuration of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is explained. A microcomputer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> employed in the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> controls the entire operation of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes a CPU, a ROM and a RAM. The CPU employed in the microcomputer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> properly loads programs from the ROM to the RAM and executes the programs to carry out various kinds of processing. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> also loads a variety of programs, mainly an authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>from a hard disk <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to a bus <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to the internal RAM in order to carry out various kinds of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>detects a timing with which the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is pressed. The authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also detects a timing with which an operation to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is completed. The detected timings are compared with similar timings received from the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by considering a difference in reference time between the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Authentication processing is then carried out in dependence on a result of comparison The reference time of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is generated from a real-time-clock signal not shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> A display unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> displays a picture taken by a photographing unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or a picture recorded in a recording medium mounted on a mechanical deck <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The photographing unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) camera or the like for photographing an object not shown in the figure and for reproducing picture data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> A communication unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also has Bluetooth configuration as the one described above. Controlled by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the communication unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> exchanges various kinds of data with the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by wireless communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> An input unit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> includes tablet buttons operated by the user to enter a variety of commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> A recording/playback control unit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> compresses video and audio data obtained by the photographing unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in accordance with a predetermined compression technique on the basis of a command issued by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and records the compressed data onto a recording medium mounted on the mechanical deck <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The recording/playback control unit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also decompresses video and audio data read out from the recording medium, plays back the original video and audio data and displays the data on the display unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The following description explains authentication operations, which are carried out when the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> employed on the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> employed on the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are operated. In order to have the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> authenticate the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and vice versa, the user presses the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the same timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>detects a timing with which the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is pressed. The authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also detects a timing with which an operation to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is completed. The detected timings are transmitted to the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a wireless communication and compared with timings received from the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> By the same token, the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>detects a timing with which the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is pressed. The authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also detects a timing with which an operation to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is completed. The detected timings are transmitted to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a wireless communication and compared with timings received from the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> If results of the comparisons indicate that the timings match each other, the authentication is determined to give a positive result. That is to say, if the electronic apparatus are not partners to be authenticated, it is out of the bounds of possibility that the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are pressed with the same timing. If the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are pressed with the same timing, on the other hand, authentication processing carried out in both the electronic apparatuses will indicate that the result of the authentication is positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Since the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are both operated by the user, that is, operated manually by a human being, however, they may probably be pressed not with strictly the same timing even though the user intends to operate the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the same timing. Thus, a time margin is taken into consideration when timings are compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> To put it in detail, assume that the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> employed in the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pressed with a timing tA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the operation to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is completed with a timing tA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. By the same token, assume that the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> employed in the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pressed with a timing tB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the operation to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is completed with a timing tB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Let the timings tB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and tB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to operate the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> employed in the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> each be used as a reference. Also assume that a margin e of about 200 ms is provided before and after each of the references.

As the outcome of the determination made at the step S<highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> indicates that the value of (counter i)/2 exceeds n, the flow of the program goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In the mean time, at steps S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also carries out the same processing as that of the authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. To put it in detail, at the step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> initializes its own counter i at 1. Then, at the next step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has been turned on (or pressed). If the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has not been turned on, the determination is made repeatedly till the outcome of the determination indicates that the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has been turned on.

If the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has not been turned off, the determination is made repeatedly till the outcome of the determination indicates that the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has been turned off. As the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is turned off, the flow of the program goes on to a step S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. At this step, the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>recognizes a time tB(i&plus;1), at which the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is turned off, that is released, and stores the time tB(i&plus;1). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, authentication processing between the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is carried out. However, such processing can be carried out between any electronic apparatuses as long as the apparatuses adopt the Bluetooth communication and connection technique. As is obvious from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B through 1D</cross-reference> showing electronic apparatuses connected to each other by adopting the Bluetooth technique, the authentication processing can thus be carried out also between the portable phone <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the handy cam-coder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, between the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the portable information communication terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C and the portable personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the portable information communication terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> In addition, in accordance with the Bluetooth standard, by setting PIN at 0, an input specifying a PIN value can be omitted. By using the function for omitting input of the PIN, the initial authentication can be carried out as an authentication conforming to the Bluetooth standard whereas the subsequent authentications can be carried out by adoption of the technique of using authentication buttons as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the number of times (n) the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are to be pressed can be changed each time the authentication processing is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, when the authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cam-coder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> carry out mutual authentication processing, one of the programs compares a timing to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with the corresponding timing to press the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> while the other program compares a timing to terminate the on state of the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with the corresponding timing to terminate the on state of the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The group of timings to be compared by the authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the group of timings to be compared by the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can each be a group of any timings as long as the group of timings to be compared by the authentication program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not overlap the group of respective timings to be compared by the authentication program <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Moreover, instead of using the reference timing tA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and tB<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the timing tA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to initially press the authentication button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the timing tB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to initially press the authentication button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can also each be used as a reference timing. In this case, a difference between tAi and tA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a difference between tBi and tB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are found for i&equals;1 to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight>Then, the difference between (tAi&minus;tA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is compared with the difference (tBi&minus;tB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for i&equals;1 to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight>Since the timings tA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and tB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are each treated as a reference timing, the number of times the remaining timings are to be compared is reduced by 1 because the number of timings to be compared is decreased by 1. However, for n&equals;1, that is, in a case in which the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are each pressed only once, the differences in timing between the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are not available. Thus, each of the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> must be pressed a plurality of times and, hence, the on state of each of the authentication buttons <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> must also be ended a plurality of times as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention has been explained by showing embodiments, which each employ the communication units <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each adopting the Bluetooth technique. However, the present invention can be applied to authentication processing in a wireless/wire communication system, which employs communication units adopting technique other than Bluetooth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows authentication processing to be performed by carrying out simple operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> The series of pieces of processing described above can be carried out by hardware or software. If the series of pieces of processing is implemented by software, a program composing the software can be installed from a recording medium into a computer including embedded special hardware or into a computer of another type such as a general-purpose personal computer capable of carrying out a variety of functions by execution of various programs installed in the personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> A recording medium embedded in the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is distributed to users in order to present a program recorded in the medium to users. The recording medium for presenting a program recorded in the medium to users is not limited to the hard disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The recording medium can also be a package medium provided separately from the computer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, examples of the package medium are the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> including a flexible disk, the optical disk <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> including a CD-ROM (Compact-Disk Read-Only Memory) and a DVD (Digital Versatile Disk), the magneto-optical disk <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> including an MD (Mini-Disc, a trademark) and the semiconductor memory <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> including a Memory Stick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, in this specification, steps describing a program stored in the recording medium can of course be executed sequentially one step after another in accordance with a written procedure. However, the steps do not have to be executed sequentially but, instead, the steps may also include pieces of processing to be carried out in parallel or individually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> In addition, the technical term &ldquo;system&rdquo; used in this specification means the entire system including a plurality of apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
