<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application Nos. 2001-34220 and 2002-13591 filed on Jun. 18, 2001 and on Mar. 13, 2002, respectively, in Korea, which are both hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a deposition method and apparatus, and more particularly, to a method of forming a thin film on a wafer using a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor devices, such as a LSI (Large Scale Integrated), a memory IC (Integrated Circuit) and other logic elements, are generally fabricated by repeated depositing and patterning processes. Fabricating the semiconductor devices widely includes epitaxy process, thin film deposition process, diffusion/ion-injection process, photolithography, etching, and so on. Among these fabrication processes, the thin film deposition process is a prerequisite for the semiconductor devices, so the thin film deposition process is essentially required and repeated throughout the manufacture of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the thin films formed by the thin film deposition process are classified into four varieties depending on their use. The first is an oxide film, such as silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), which is often used for a gate oxidized film or a field oxidized film. The second is a nitride film, such as silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), which serves to insulate conductive layers. Also, the nitride film is used as a passivation layer that protects the underlay layers and as a mask in the diffusion/ion-injection process. The third is a silicon layer, such as a polycrystalline silicon film, which is often used as a gate electrode in substitute for metal. The fourth is a metal layer, which serves to connect the structural elements in the semiconductor devices or acts as an electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) will briefly be explained. A wafer is first loaded into the chamber that has an airtight reaction room therein, and then a plurality of source gases are injected into that chamber. Thereafter, the plurality of source gases are reacted with one another in the chamber, and then a thin film is formed on the wafer. Recently, the CVD is often performed under a low pressure to achieve desired step coverage and uniform thickness as well as to avoid contamination due to an atmospheric pressure condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a thin film deposition apparatus diagram for the CVD according to a conventional art. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the conventional thin film deposition apparatus includes a chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a gas supplier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an airtight reaction room therein and a wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is loaded on a chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> inside the airtight reaction room. The gas supplier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serves to contain a plurality of source gases that will be introduced into the reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the gas supplier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to receive the source gases through the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A gas outflow pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the bottom of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a decompression device, such as a pump P, is connected to the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the gas outflow pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the gas supplier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, there are first and second gas containers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which store first and second gases S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. First and second mass flow controllers (MFCs) <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are connected to the first and second gas containers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively. The first MFC <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> controls the flow rate of first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second MFC <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> controls the flow rate of second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is mounted on the chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made airtight and then the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> contained in the first gas container <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is supplied into the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the first MFC <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> contained in the second gas container <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is supplied into the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the second MFC <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The first and second gases S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> react with each other in the airtight reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that a reaction product are deposited on the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to form a thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, the airtight reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> should be kept at a high temperature in order to promote the gas reaction. For the high temperature atmosphere in the airtight reaction room, the chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a heater <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that heats up the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the airtight reaction room. The atmospheric temperature in the airtight reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can vary depending on the gases, gas reaction and reaction product. Especially, when the nitride film or oxide film are formed on the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the atmosphere of the airtight reaction room should be maintained at a temperature of about 700 degrees centigrade. For the purpose of forming the nitride film or oxide film, one of NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used as a first gas and either of SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is used as a second gas. Among these gases, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are usually very stable chemical compounds so that the atmospheric temperature of about 700 degrees centigrade are required in the airtight reaction room to accelerate the gas reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, due to the high atmospheric temperature of the airtight reaction room, the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is exposed under the high temperature for a relatively long time, and thus the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> receives serious thermal shock. When the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is left under the high temperature, the thin film formed on the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is damaged and deteriorated by the impurities. Furthermore, the ion-impurities doped onto the thin film are spoiled. Therefore, the high atmospheric temperature threatens the reliability and stability of the semiconductor devices and then eventually degrades the semiconductor devices. Additionally, the thin film deposition apparatus should have a complicated structure for controlling and maintaining the high atmospheric temperature in the airtight reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These interrupt the fabrication process of the semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To overcome the above-mentioned problems, a remote plasma method is researched and developed in these days. According to the remote plasma method, the first and/or second gases are excited into plasma to let the source gases have a low activation energy, and then the activated plasma gas radicals are introduced into the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To generate the plasma gas radicals, a Capacitively Coupled Plasma (CCP) generator or an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) generator is applied in positions A and B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, the above-mentioned remote plasma generator causes some problems. Namely, the CCP or ICP generator creates sputtering phenomenon or charging damage in the reaction room of the chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Since the charged plasma is difficult to be controlled, the plasma ions collide against the wafer at high speed, i.e., the sputtering phenomenon. Therefore, the wafer gets serious physical damages. When the plasma density in the reaction area is not uniform or is abnormally high, the thin film formed on the wafer get the plasma charging damages. These problems bring about serious trouble in the semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the remote plasma generators are additionally installed in the thin film deposition apparatus, the cost of thin film deposition apparatus increases and the cost of production are also raised. Additionally, since the pressure of the first and/or second gases introduced into the chamber has to be limited on account of plasma excitation and maintenance, the productivity decreases when forming the thin film on the wafer. </paragraph>

The first gas container <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is connected to the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through both first and second connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, while the second gas container <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is connected to the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through a third connecting pipe <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. First to third mass flow controllers (MFCs) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are located in the first to third connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, respectively. The flow rate of first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled by both the first and second MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and the third MFC <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> controls the flow rate of second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Namely, the first to third MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> handle the flow rate of the source gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According the present invention, a gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is connected between the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or between the second MFC <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows that the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is positioned in the first connecting pipe <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> between the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be located in the second connecting pipe <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> between the second MFC <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. At this point, it is self-evident in the present invention that the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is in the third connecting pipe <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> between the third MFC <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. If there is a third gas container storing a third gas in the gas supplier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a fourth connecting pipe can connect the third gas container to the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a fourth MFC can be located in the fourth connecting pipe between the third gas container and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be installed in one or all of the connecting pipes between the MFC and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter, it is assumed that the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is installed in the first connecting pipe <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> between the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> pre-heats up the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a temperature from 300 to 2000 degrees centigrade in order to activate the first gas S I into the radical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, the airtight reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> should be kept at a high temperature in order to promote the gas reaction. For the high temperature atmosphere in the airtight reaction room, the chuck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a first heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that heats up the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the airtight reaction room. The atmospheric temperature in the airtight reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can vary depending on the gases, gas reaction and reaction product. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the present invention is located between the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and has a pipe or tube shape, i.e., a cylindrical shape. Especially, the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes a gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>where a second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is installed. The second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> heats up at a temperature of 300 to 2000 degrees centigrade. The gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes a packing filter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> therein, which surrounds the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a same electrical resistance heating system as the first heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) so that the second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can have a power source jointly with the first heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The packing filter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> surrounding the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a plurality of air gaps therein and serves to maximize thermal contact area. Therefore, the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can effectively dissipate heat generated by the second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using such a packing filter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passing through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can efficiently receives thermal energy from the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In the present invention, the packing filter is a plurality of small beads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, or a grid of wire mesh <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. The plurality of small beads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> fill the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and surround the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The grid of wire mesh <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is formed by winding the wires around the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Heat-resistant materials are used as a material for the packing filters <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that the packing filters <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> do not react with the source gases. Advisably, the packing filters <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are made of ceramic. The plurality of small beads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serve not only to transfer the heat to the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> but also to prevent the heat dissipation outside the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the beads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is as good as it is smaller, but should not interrupt the gas flow. Advisably, the diameter of the beads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is less than 2 millimeters and the optimum size of the beads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 1 millimeter in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passing through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is heated up to more than 300 and less than 2000 degrees centigrade by the second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> installed in the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, due to the maximized contact area, the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> efficiently receives thermal energy from the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the molecular structure of the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is easily decomposed to make radicals of the first gas that have the lower activation energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as aforementioned with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the first gas container <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is connected to the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> though the first and second connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Further, the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is on the first connecting pipe <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and the second MFC <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is on the second connecting pipe <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Thus, the first and second MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> control the flow rate of the firs gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to supply the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the first and second connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The thin film deposition process that uses the above-mentioned deposition apparatus will be explained hereinafter. When the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is mounted on the chuck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the chamber is made airtight. Thereafter, the first heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> installed in the chuck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> heats up and simultaneously the first and second gases S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are introduced into the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by the first to third MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. At this time, the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes throughout the first and second connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> by the first and second MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, respectively. The first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passing through the first connecting pipe <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> by the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is heated up by the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at a temperature of more than 300 and less than 2000 degrees centigrade, and thus the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passing through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is changed into the radicals. As a result, the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passing through the first connecting pipe <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is provided as radicals, while the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passing through the second connecting pipe <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is provided as it is without any decomposition. The second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supplied into the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the third connecting pipe <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. So the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the radicals of first gas, and the second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> coexist in the airtight reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and then these gases and radicals react with one another in the airtight reaction room to form the reaction product on the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned deposition process, if the thin film deposited on the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is nitride film or oxide film, the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selected from a group consisting of NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or from a group consisting of SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. Among these gases, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are needed to be activated by passing the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, if one of these gases is used for the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, it is expected and possible that all the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes through the first connecting pipe <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in order to change all the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the radicals. However, this reduces the productivity. For example, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be converted into N, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, H, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NH and/or NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by the thermal decomposition. Among these gases N, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, H, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NH and NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas does not contribute to the thin film deposition process. If the gaseous ratio of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>increases, the productivity of thin film will be reduced. Therefore, it is recommended that the first and second connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are connected to the first gas container <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to supply the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> separately. The mixture rate of the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the radicals of first gas is illustrated as the following Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> For the result shown in Table 1, NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used as a first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is used as a second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that a silicon nitride thin film is deposited on the wafer. During the experiment to get the result shown in Table 1, the flow rate of the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the chamber is fixed at 2000 sccm in order to comprehend the excellent mixture rate of the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the radicals of first gas. P-NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in Table 1 shows a quantity of NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>passing through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and L-NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in Table 1 shows a quantity of NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>passing through the second connecting pine <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has a temperature of 1100 degrees centigrade, the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a pressure of 20 Torr, and the process temperature in the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is 700 degrees centigrade. The N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas having a flow rate of 1000 sccm is used for the carrier gas, and the deposition process is carried out for about 180 seconds. After the experiment, the characteristics of the deposited thin film are examined as the following five items: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 1. THK: Showing the thickness of the deposited thin film. The thickness THK of the deposited thin film is measured in the five points (at the central point of the deposited thin film, up-and-down points, and right-and-left points) on the deposited thin film. As the thickness increases, the productivity of the thin film becomes higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 2. DR: Deposition Rate (DR) showing the thickness of deposited thin film per minute. The value of deposition rate is also measured in the five points on the deposited thin film. As the deposition rate increases, the productivity of the thin film becomes higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 3. Unif: Showing the uniformity of the deposited thin film. As the uniformity Unif becomes closer to zero (0), the deposited thin film becomes superior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> 4. RI: Refraction Index (RI) of the deposited thin film. In view of the SiN thin film, when the refraction index value ranges from 1.8 to 2.0, it is quite satisfactory. Within that range of 1.8 to 2.0, the greater the refraction index value the greater the thin film quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> 5. WR: Wet-etch Rate. The wet-etch rate WR is a value that shows the comparison of the wet-etched thin film with the oxidized film. The wet-etch rate WR shows the etching speed of the deposited thin film as compared to the thermal oxidized film. In this experiment, the etching solution is a HF solution having a ratio of 100 to 1. The etching experiment is performed for about 20 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> 6. IR-PR: IR Peak Ratio. The greater the N&mdash;H/Si&mdash;H peak ratio the greater the thin film quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As a result shown in Table 1, when all the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, passes through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and then is introduced into chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the productivity of the thin film decreases. However, the thin film qualities, such as WR and IR-PR, are improved. Although the above-mentioned experiment is conducted under the temperature of 700 degrees centigrade in the reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the same result is expected when the process temperature is less than 600 degrees centigrade in the reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Accordingly in the present invention, since the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is utilized in the thin film deposition apparatus, the process temperature in the reaction room can be reduced dramatically and the thermal budget into the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is minimized. </paragraph>

Especially, when the process temperature in the reaction room is less than 700 degrees centigrade, the productivity of the thin film is further reduced. Therefore, when all the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, passes through the second connecting pipe <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, the process temperature in the reaction room should be maintained at a temperature of more than 700 degrees centigrade and the thermal budget onto the wafer is not avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing etch rate-dependence of gas heater temperature. In order to get the result shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the pressure in the reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> was about 18 Torr, and the temperature in the reaction room was about 650 degrees centigrade. When the temperature of the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> ranges from 300 to 900 degrees centigrade, the etch rate of the thin film is measured. The flow rate of NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas is 1000 sccm, and the flow rate of SIH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is 50 sccm. Furthermore, the etch rate shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is measured when the Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>thin film deposited on the wafer is etched by H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>at a temperature of 160 degrees centigrade for 270 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the x-axis represents the temperature of the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> through which the NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas passes, and the y-axis represents the etch rate per minute. The bar graph illustrated by the dotted line on the right side of the graph shows the etch rate according to the conventional art under the same conditions, i.e., the NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 1000 sccm, the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 50 sccm, and the reaction room pressure of 18 Torr. Furthermore, the etch rate shown by the dotted bar graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is measured when the first heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> has a temperature of 750 degrees centigrade and when the deposited thin film is etched by H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>under a temperature of 160 degrees centigrade for 270 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> With reference to the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the gas heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the gas pre-treatment <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has the temperature of 900 degrees centigrade, the thin film deposited by the present invention has the same characteristics as the thin film conventionally deposited under the temperature of about 750 degrees centigrade even if the reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has the temperature of more than 600 to less then 700 degrees centigrade (advisably, about 650 degrees centigrade). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when forming the thin film according to the present invention, it is recommended that the first and second MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> adjust the gas flow rate at the same rate. Namely, the first and second MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> distribute the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the same flow rate. Therefore, according the to present invention, the thermal budget onto the wafer is minimized, and the productivity and characteristics of the thin film are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Now with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the thin film deposition process will be explained briefly. When the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is first loaded on the chuck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the first heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> heats up to supply appropriate heat to the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. At this time, the temperature of the first heat <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the present invention is much lower compared to the conventional chemical vapor deposition process. Thereafter, the first and second gases S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are supplied into the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the first and second connecting pipes <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and through the third connecting pipe <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, respectively. At this time of supplying the source gases, the flow rate of the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled by the first and second MFCs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, while the flow rate of the second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is controlled by the third MFC <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Specially, the first MFC <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> controls the flow rate of the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that passes through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. When passing through the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes throughout the packing filter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) and is heated up to be activated into radicals. Then, the radicals of the first gas are introduced into the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the gas inflow pipe <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the first and second gases S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since the activated radical gas has a low activation energy, the chemical reaction is easily conducted at a relatively low temperature in the reaction room as compared to the conventional process. In the reaction room of the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the radicals of first gas coexist with the first gas S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second gas S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The chemical reaction of these coexisting gases in the reaction room forms the thin film on the wafer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, a cooling system that prevents the heat generated from the second heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be formed around the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in order to maintain the safety during the process. Further, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the gas pre-treatment device of the present invention can be installed in the others connecting pipes. Although the present invention having the gas pre-treatment device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is explained focusing on the chemical vapor deposition, the present invention can be adopted in other apparatuses manufacturing the semiconductor devices. Namely, the present invention can be applied in such an ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) or a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the gas heater in the gas pre-treatment device heats up at a temperature of from 300 to 2000 degrees centigrade, and the gas pre-treatment includes the packing filter surrounding the gas heater. Therefore, the source gas is easily activated and then supplied into the chamber. Additionally, since the thin film deposition process is conducted at a relatively low temperature in the reaction room according to the present invention, the thermal budget onto the wafer is minimized, thereby obtaining the improved thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the present invention provides the gas pre-treatment device having a simple structure, the fabrication of the semiconductor devices can be simplified. By way of controlling the flow rates and pressures of the first gas using the first and second MFCs, the amount of the activated gas can be controlled freely and thus the productivity and quantity of the deposited thin film is adjustable as freely as it does. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, since the second heater installed in the gas pre-treatment device has the same electrical resistance heating system as the first heater installed in the chuck, the second heater can have the power source jointly with the first heater, thereby simplifying the deposition apparatus and reducing the cost of production. Furthermore, the packing filter, such as the plurality of beads and the grid of wire mesh, increases the thermal contact area of the source gas, the gas activation is easily carried out. As mentioned before, the packing filter is made of ceramic or other heat-resistant materials, so the gas activation process is safely performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the capacitor and the manufacturing method thereof of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
