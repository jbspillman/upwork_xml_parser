<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to modular conveyor chains, and more particularly to a side guard for use on a modular conveyor chain link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Modular belting is formed from interconnected links which are supported by a frame and driven to transport a product. Each link has a support surface which supports the product as the belting is being driven along the frame. In certain applications, side guards are fixed to, or are formed as an integral part of, the link to prevent a conveyed load from falling off of the belt. Side guards attached to the belt move with the product being conveyed to minimize relative motion between the support surface and the side guard. Minimizing the relative motion reduces product damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Prior art side guards, such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, are fixed to a modular belt, and are arranged in overlapping relation to prevent large longitudinal gaps from forming when the belt flexes around a drive or idle sprocket. The side guards are typically attached to the belt near the belt width edges, and are fixed at an angle, known as a shingle angle, relative to the belt edge to avoid interference between adjacent side guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The height of the side guard and amount of belt flexing required determines the extent of side guard overlap. As height or flexing requirements increase, more overlap is required to prevent gaps from opening up as the belt flexes. Increasing the overlap, typically requires a greater shingle angle to prevent interference between the side guards as the belt flexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Increasing the shingle angle to prevent interference between the side guards increases the clearance between adjacent side guards. When conveying small products, increasing overlap, and thus the shingle angle, between side guards is undesirable because the product can wedge between the side guards causing damage to the side guards and the product. Moreover, increasing the shingle angle causes the side guards to consume more of the belt area, thus reducing the usable area of the belt. Accordingly, a need exists for a belt having a side guard which can negotiate small sprockets without requiring a large shingle clearance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a modular belt link which includes a link base having at least one hinge barrel for connecting the link to adjacent links. A side guard is fixed to the link base, and defines a non-planar wall having a bottom and top joined by sides. The wall is twisted relative to an axis of rotation extending through said top and bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A general objective of the present invention is to provide a side guard link which minimizes interferences while maximizing product support surface area. This objective is accomplished by twisting the side guard to increase clearances at the side guard top while minimizing the encroachment of the side guard bottom on the support surface are of the belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This and still other objectives and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the description which follows. In the detailed description below, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in reference to the accompanying drawings.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A modular conveyor belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, includes a plurality of chain links <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and side guard links <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The links <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are pivotally linked to adjacent links <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to form the continuous belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The side guard links <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include side guards <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and are arranged to define a continuous sidewall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which defines an edge of a belt support area <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, each side guard link <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a link base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> including a body <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a top surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> joined by lateral edges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Hinge barrels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed as an integral part of the link body <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extend alternatively past the opposing lateral edges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Each hinge barrel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending past the same lateral edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes an opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is aligned with a hinge barrel of an adjacent link to receive a hinge pin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which pivotally links the adjacent links <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together. Although a link base having a body is preferred, the base can be the hinge barrels without the body, such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is, preferably, formed as an integral part of the link base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and has a top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> joined by sides <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which define a non-planar wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The non-planar wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends substantially perpendicular to the link body top surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and defines a portion of one of the continuous sidewalls <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Although forming the side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as an integral part of the link base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown, the side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be fixed to the link base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using methods known in the art, such as by welding, mechanical fasteners, interference fits, and the like without departing from the scope of the present invention. Moreover, as disclosed above, the side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be fixed directly to the hinge barrels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> without an intervening link body <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The non-planar wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is twisted relative to an axis of rotation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extending through the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to the link top surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the amount of twist is defined by the difference between the angle A that the side guard bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is rotated about the axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> relative to a link direction of travel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the angle B that the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated about the axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> relative to the link direction of travel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the twisted side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> accommodates the increased interference requirement at the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> without decreasing the useable belt support area <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> proximal the side guard bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The amount of twist can also be quantified by an angle C defined by a first vertical plane <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> defined by the side guard bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and passing through the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a second vertical plane <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> defined by the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and passing through the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The two planes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are not coplanar and intersect at the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to define the angle C which is not 0&deg;. Most preferably, the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated more than the side guard bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The amount of twist is dependent upon the height of the side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the greatest amount of belt back flex required, and the desired clearances between adjacent side guards <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Providing a twisted side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is especially advantageous for conveyor belts with small pitches, such as less than one inch. Small pitch belts are generally used to convey small products which can pass between gaps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) between the side guards <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the belt is typically required to back flex to a tighter radii than longer pitch belts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the side guard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can also be varied to minimize the gaps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> while maintaining required clearances between the adjacent side guards <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the side guard wall thickness decreases from the side guard bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to efficiently close the gaps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> between the adjacent side guards <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> proximal the side guard bottom <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> while providing the necessary clearance proximal the side guard top <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the side guard links <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> intermesh with typical chain links <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to form the belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a typical chain link <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can include a link body <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> joined by lateral edges <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Hinge barrels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are formed as an integral part of the link body <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extend alternatively past the opposing lateral edges <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and interdigitively mate with hinge barrels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed in an adjacent link body <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Each hinge barrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending past the same lateral edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> includes a coaxial opening <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which receive a hinge pin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to pivotally link adjacent links <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The side guard links are, preferably, molded plastic, and formed as a single piece. However, the link base and side guard can be formed separately from the same or different materials, and comprise multiple pieces without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the side guard can be formed from a metal, such as stainless steel, which is joined to a base formed from plastic, and vice versa, without departing from the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> While there has been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
