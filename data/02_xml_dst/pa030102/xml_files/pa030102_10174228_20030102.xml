<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to a suspension system for a toy vehicle. The suspension system is independent in that it comprises at least four damping mechanisms (shock absorber), each shock absorber being located proximal to each wheel location. Each shock absorber utilizes a tensioning device, such as a compressed spring, positioned between the toy vehicle chassis and a suspension arm, to provide the active damping feature of the invention. Each shock absorber also utilizes an adjustment means, such as a screw, to selectively change the distance between the suspension arm and chassis. As the screw is adjusted, so the spring is either more or less compressed, providing for a stiffer (more compressed) or a softer (less compressed) suspension. Furthermore, adjusting the screw to compress the spring causes the body of the toy vehicle to be lowered relative to the suspension arm/wheel assembly, and adjustment of the spring to decrease the spring compression causes the body of the toy vehicle to be raised relative to the suspension arm/wheel assembly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to the field of scale model toy vehicles. More particularly, the present invention relates to an adjustable suspension system that provides 1) an active damping mechanism (also referred to herein as shocks or shock absorbers) and 2) an adjustment to the shocks which changes the damping and sets the height of the toy vehicle body relative to the axis of the wheel/suspension arm units. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Known suspension systems for toy vehicles that utilize springs have generally been of the damping variety only. That is, the body of the vehicle will move relative to the axis of the wheel/suspension arm units, but the body ultimately returns to it&apos;s original position. Therefore, known toy vehicle suspension systems using springs lack the ability to change the height of the body relative to the axis of the wheel/suspension arm units on a semi permanent basis. With the popularity of customizing full-size vehicles by changing the body height relative to the axis of the wheel/suspension arm units with the appropriate change in the behavior of the suspension (for example, lowering the body in the case of&ldquo;low riders&rdquo; with their harder suspension and raising the body in the case of&ldquo;high-rise trucks&rdquo; with their softer suspension), the need has been identified for a toy vehicle that can replicate these custom features. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide an active damping suspension system for a toy vehicle that includes the ability to set the height of the body relative to the axis of the wheel/suspension arm units on a semi permanent basis. The toy vehicle body may be adjusted higher relative to the axis of the wheel/suspension arm units or lower, depending on the customized &ldquo;look&rdquo; that the user desires. The present invention provides for a manual shock setting using a mechanism that combines a spring, and an adjustment element, such as a screw, at each wheel location, such that the toy vehicle body-wheel axis distance can be adjusted up or down via the adjustment element, and that such adjustments can be repeatedly made. These adjustments also soften or harden the suspension depending on whether the adjustment is made to raise or lower the vehicle body. The present invention may be further understood by consideration of the following drawings and associated description.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIG. II of the drawings, the toy vehicle adjustable suspension system shown may be used on any of various toy vehicles such as a passenger car, pick-up truck, sports utility vehicle, stock car, racing car, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In it&apos;s preferred embodiment, the vehicle chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in FIG. I has a generally rectangular configuration. The chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has at least four suspension arm support means, also referred to as chassis tabs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each chassis tab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is located on the chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to align with the axial plane of each wheel assembly (shown with hidden line detail in FIG. I). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIG. II, III, and/or IV, the chassis tab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has an upper horizontal plane, which has an upper surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a lower surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; an angular plane, which has an upper surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a lower surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; and a lower horizontal plane, which has an upper surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a lower surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The chassis tab lower horizontal plane has a radial inner wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> located at approximately it&apos;s center. The radial inner wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has means for retaining the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is a threaded hole (also referred to as &ldquo;threaded retainer&rdquo;). The chassis tab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also has a means for attaching the suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> while permitting lateral and longitudinal adjustment of the suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In our preferred embodiment this attachment is achieved using a cylindrical groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> located at the intersection of the first horizontal plane lower surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and angular plane lower surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The profile of the cylindrical groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the range of 180-300 degrees, the purpose of which will become clear in the description of the method of assembly, below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. II and/or IV, in it&apos;s preferred embodiment, the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is a circular shaft that has longitudinal axis and at its upper end a means for rotationally turning the adjustment element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about its longitudinal axis (as illustrated in FIG. II, rotation is provided for by a first flange <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shaped to accept a cross-head style screwdriver, but it could also be a thumb-screw type, or the like). Proximal to its upper end, the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a threaded shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to match the threaded radial inner wall of the chassis tab second horizontal plane <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The threaded shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a diameter greater than the means for retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Below the threaded section of the shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a diameter less than the means for retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. At the adjustment element lower end is a means for retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The tension element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in our preferred embodiment is a spring-type element as shown in FIGS. II and/or IV, which has an inner diameter that is greater than the outer diameter of both the adjustment element retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and threaded shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. II, III and IV. The suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> first end has a means for connecting it to the chassis tab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which in it&apos;s preferred embodiment, is a circular shaft section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is sized to provide a friction or slide fit with the chassis tab cylindrical groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By attaching each suspension arm via its circular shaft section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the cylindrical groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of each chassis tab, a hinged connection between these components is achieved, allowing vertical movement of the suspension arm. The suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> also has a rectangular section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which has an upper face <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a lower face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Referring to FIG. III, the suspension arm rectangular section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a means for retaining the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (also referred to as &ldquo;slotted socket retainer&rdquo;), which provides axial alignment and allows rotational movement of the adjustment element while allowing the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to perform it&apos;s adjustment function. In our preferred embodiment, the suspension arm rectangular section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a cut-out <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with an oversized end-radius <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The cut-out <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shaped to permit the shaft of the adjustment element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be inserted into the cut-out <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and to provide means for retention of the retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the oversized end-radius <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and allow for the slight lateral movement of the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that occurs when the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is adjusted. The preferred embodiment for the means for retention of the adjustment element is illustrated in FIG. II and IV, showing a ball-socket arrangement as between the retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (ball) and oversized end-radius <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (socket). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. II and III, in our preferred embodiment, the suspension arm <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a second end section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the end of the rectangular section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which has an internally threaded bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to provide means for attaching the suspension system assembly of the present invention to the wheel assembly (see FIG. V for the relationship between suspension system and wheel assembly). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The foregoing describes the components that combine to form the preferred embodiment of the present invention, which may be assembled as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into the threaded retainer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> from the top, adjustment element retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> first. The adjustment element retention element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the shaft section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, pass through the radial inner wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The adjustment element is then rotated so that the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> screws into the radial inner wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> until the adjustment element first flange <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts the chassis tab second horizontal plane upper surface. The tension element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is then placed over the portion of the adjustment element that extends from the chassis tab second horizontal plane lower surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is attached to the chassis tab <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by connecting the circular shaft section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the suspension arm to the cylindrical groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the chassis tab. The suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is then manually positioned so that the adjustment element shaft section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is inserted into the suspension arm rectangular section cut-out <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and moved toward the countersunk radial inner wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This configuration maintains the axial alignment of the adjustment element while allowing for rotation of the adjustment element, and for longitudinal alignment of the suspension arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As assembled, the tension element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> creates a tensional force between the suspension rectangular section upper face <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and chassis tab second horizontal plane lower surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This permits the tension element to act as a shock absorber. The relative tension of the tension element (or damping of the shock absorber) can be adjusted by turning the adjustment element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to compress the tension element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which creates a stiffer shock and lowers the toy vehicle body, relative to the wheel/axle assembly. This adjustment is used to give the toy vehicle the stiffer suspension and lowered body appearance of a &ldquo;low-rider.&rdquo; By turning the tension element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the opposite direction to reduce the tension of the tension element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the shock becomes less stiff and increases the height of the toy vehicle body relative to the to the wheel/axle assembly. This adjustment is used to give the toy vehicle the increased body height appearance of a &ldquo;high-rise truck&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Various modifications can be made without departing from the broader scope of the present invention. The purpose of the present invention is to allow the suspension of a toy vehicle to be adjusted on a semi-permanent basis so that the body can be raised/lowered and the shock stiffness can be increased/decreased: It should be recognized that the present invention can be achieved in a number of ways, including but not limited to adjustment of the suspension from the underside of the toy vehicle, and that this invention is intended to cover such other ways within the scope and spirit of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
