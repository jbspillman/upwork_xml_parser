<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to a business method for billboard advertising and, more particularly, to advertising business methods for billboards capable of dynamic-content display. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Billboards are used to display various messages typically consisting of a combination of text and graphics. Traditionally, the message has been provided by way of fixed sheets that are pasted to a backing. This traditional approach suffers from the inability to quickly change the displayed message since it requires the use of a crew to change the message. Electronic billboards provide the advantage in that it is easier to change the displayed message. Electronic billboards include the dot matrix type utilizing many individual bulbs. Within stadiums, arenas and auditoriums there presently are electronic dot matrix display devices used for instant replays, advertising and customer information. While these electronic billboards are easily changed, they are difficult to manage and often require significant support resources to coordinate billboard content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Loban et al disclose a video billboard including a remote computer control with radio communications to the billboard display in U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,741 (&apos;741). The &apos;741 patent discloses that display information is communicated from a master computer to a receiver in the billboard housing which, in turn, controls the light valve display of the &apos;741 invention. Commands may also be communicated via shared or dedicated landlines. The &apos;741 billboard is capable of providing complex video graphics with high contrast ratios. It can provide message changes on command through landline, cellular phone, satellite relay or other wireless communication links. Within the commercial advertising billboard industry it will allow the use of computer video control to change graphics easily and quickly, as desired. Advertisements, public service announcements or traffic conditions can be displayed in near real time from remote locations since images can be downloaded via the communication links and displayed at pre-programmed time slots, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Gofman et al. disclose a system and method for serving local and global media content in PCT publication WO 00/52935 (&apos;52935). The &apos;52935 publication discloses a system and method for combining broadcast media content with additional content at a local site according to at least one locally determined characteristic of the audience to which the combined content is served. The &apos;52935 publication discloses a template containing information concerning the type of data objects to be displayed, their size and location on the display, as well as the timing of display and transitions to the display, such that the template describes how to process and display the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> New display materials are being developed that have the potential to expand advertising billboard technology, such as, for example, GYRICON a trade name of Xerox Corporation, Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto Calif. These new materials have the potential to expand the capabilities of billboard displays. Another new material for displays is E-INK, a trade name of E Ink Corporation 733 Concord Avenue, Cambridge, Mass. GYRICON technology is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,854. E-INK technology is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,588. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although significant improvements are expanding the capabilities of billboard displays, as the capabilities expand the effort necessary to control the displays is expanding concurrently. It would therefore be advantageous to provide an improved business method of billboard advertising that reduces the effort necessary to manage dynamic billboard displays. It would further be advantageous to provide an advertising device that easily controls multiple combinations of content display units. It would also be advantageous to provide easily manageable dynamic-content display. It would further be advantageous to provide a system capable of time shared display output from a heirarchical control structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to advertising business methods for billboard advertising and, more particularly, to advertising business methods for billboards capable of dynamic-content display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Content-display units are herein defined to include any visual display or portion of display capable of displaying information from dynamic-content such as, for example, video billboards, GYRICON, E-lnk, computer monitors, shopping mall kiosks, stadium displays, personal digital assistants, movie-theater screens, video projectors, and cellular phone displays. Content display units are divided into two types, active content-display units and passive content-display units. Active content-display units are displays that only display dynamic-content when they are actively being addressed or written on, such as, for example, computer monitors, movie-theater screens, and L.E.D. displays. Passive content-display units are displays that, when not being actively written to or addressed, retain a viewable image such as, for example, GYRICON and E-INK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A suitable material for a passive content-display media would be, for example, SMARTPAPER (Trademark of Gyricon Inc. Palo Alto, Calif.) technology using an array of tiny (100 micron diameter or smaller) solid beads with one hemisphere of each bead one color (e.g. white) and the other a different color (e.g. black). These beads are embedded in a flexible plastic sheet in small cavities surrounded by a liquid. Each bead carries an electrical charge. When an external electric field is applied the bead rotates or gyrates. Adhesive forces between each bead and cavity wall require an electrical threshold be exceeded before it will rotate. This makes an image electrically &ldquo;printed&rdquo; onto the material stable and unchanging until &ldquo;erased&rdquo; by another transmission. Electrical signals can be applied to the SMARTPAPER sheets through fixed surface electrodes or a moving stylus. A networked programmable sign will run for up to 2 years on 3 AA batteries, with the power almost completely used by the communications and processing systems. SMARTPAPER itself requires just a capacitance or voltage (about 100 volts), not a power current. Unlike other types of electronic displays, SMARTPAPER has a wide viewing angle identical to traditional printed signs. This allows SMARTPAPER to be viewed like paper, from all angles and without added backlighting. Images can currently be displayed on SMARTPAPER with resolution over 100 dpi. Applying electrical fields to the display surface changes the image on SMARTPAPER. For purposes herein, GYRICON and SMARTPAPER are synonymous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Dynamic-content is herein defined as information or data to be visually displayed that is updatable or changeable by electronic control such as, for example, pixel data from a digitized image, analog beam modulation information for a cathode ray tube (CRT), streaming video over a network, and ASCII character codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an advertising billboard system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Advertising billboard system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a display controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adapted to receive, store, and display a dynamic-content <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> from the server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Display controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes at least one content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, storage means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and may include a timing means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Dynamic-content <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is transmitted from server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on a transmission path <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, through transmission media <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and on receiving path <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to display controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Transmission path <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, transmission media <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and receiving path <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be any one or combination of data transfer such as, for example, telephone wire, internet link, radio communication, cellular telephony, microwave link, local area network, and satellite broadcast. Receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receives the dynamic-content <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> where it is either stored in storage means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, or displayed on content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Storage means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be, for example, dynamic RAM in a computer, video tape, display memory, and computer hard disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> visually displays the information from the dynamic-content <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The timing means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a clock, a Global Positioning System (GPS), timing trigger, or other means of detecting a timing event. The display controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> alters the visual display of the content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as a function of the time or position from the timing means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. For example, if content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is located near a commuter highway visible to commuters, it may be desirable to display a first message on content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> during commuter rush hours, and to display a second different message on content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at other times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Content-display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be located, for example, on the side of a semi-trailer travelling over the road within a city. It may be desirable to display a first message whenever the semi-trailer is within a defined area, and a second message whenever the semi-trailer is outside of a defined area. It is contemplated that, for example, within the boundaries of an acceptable travelling range a first message could indicate trailer contents, and outside the acceptable travelling range a second message could indicate that the trailer should be stopped. As a second example, whenever a trailer having a content-display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is within a defined distance from &ldquo;JOE&apos;s&rdquo;, it may be desirable to display &ldquo;EAT at JOE&apos;s&rdquo; on display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of advertising billboard system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> including a plurality of content display units <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The advertising billboard system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also comprise a plurality of display controllers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in communication with a plurality of content display units <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, each one from the plurality of display controllers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> having a type identifier, wherein each of the display controllers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> selects dynamic-content <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for display on its content display unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as a function of its type identifier. For example, display controller <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may have a type identifier of highway billboard, display controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may have a type identifier of shopping mall kiosk, display controller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may have a type identifier of computer monitors on a local area network, and display controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may have a type identifier of an individuals cell phone display. </paragraph>
