<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to cosmetic compositions as well as cosmetic compositions adapted for application to a substrate to provide applied cosmetic compositions of improved color of improved color perception, for example, improved skin color tones, effects and/or variations. The cosmetic compositions comprise at least two discrete color domains, which are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed more closely, for example, under magnification. The present invention is also directed to methods for providing such cosmetic compositions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Perception of color is determined by the observation of light reflecting across visible wavelengths, specifically within the range of about 400-700 nm. To measure the perceived color of an object, a spectrophotometric curve (also termed &ldquo;spectral curve&rdquo;) may be plotted wherein the percentage of reflectance is measured versus the wavelength of light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various cosmetic compositions are provided to simulate natural skin color, for example as foundations, or to provide accessory color, for example as blushes, eye shadows, lipsticks and the like. Additionally, in an attempt to revitalize and duplicate the natural and original properties of skin, various cosmetic compositions have also been developed, including, for example, foundations and concealers. Typically, the cosmetic compositions are applied to the skin to cover imperfections and/or simulate healthy or natural-looking skin. In addition to these applications, however, many people also desire to apply cosmetic compositions to achieve various color tones effects and/or variations. For instance, typical &ldquo;effects and/or variations&rdquo; may include, but are not limited to, decorative color cosmetics that are widely used to accentuate natural features with more striking, unnatural colors. Thus, there is a need for color cosmetics, like lipsticks, eyeshadows, nail polishes, and even artists&apos; makeup products, for which it is desirable that a target color be delivered to the intended skin surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, many current cosmetic compositions typically do not sufficiently and accurately depict the color tone, effect and/or variation desired by the user. As a result, the cosmetic compositions appear dull and unrealistic whereby an unnatural skin look and/or color tone is achieved. Accordingly, there is a need for providing cosmetic compositions that substantially represents a desired skin tone color, effect and/or variation once applied to the skin, e.g., lipcolor, nail color, self-tanning product or artists&apos; makeup. Additionally, it is desirable for these compositions to have enhanced color and to provide sufficient coverage once applied to skin. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide novel cosmetic compositions and methods for providing cosmetic compositions that overcome one or more disadvantages of the prior art. It is a further advantage of the invention to provide novel cosmetic compositions having improved color perception, including improved color tones, effects and/or variations, and methods for providing such cosmetic compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to cosmetic compositions having at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant. The color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to cosmetic compositions adapted for application to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic composition. The applied cosmetic composition comprises at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant. The color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, the invention is directed to methods for providing a cosmetic composition with a desired color. The methods comprise adding at least two discrete color domains, each of which has at least one colorant, to the cosmetic composition, wherein the color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These novel features of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which is simply, by way of illustration, various modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other different obvious aspects all without departing from the invention.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic compositions according to the present invention exhibit a desired color perception, and more specifically a desired skin tone color, effect and/or variation once applied to skin. More particularly, the present invention is directed to cosmetic compositions having a desired color tone, effect and/or variation and comprising at least two discrete color domains not readily discernible individually to the naked eye but are distinguishable under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;cosmetic compositions&rdquo; refers to the prepackaged formulation of a cosmetic product as well as to a formulation that may be adapted for delivery to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; means that other steps and ingredients can be added. This term encompasses the terms &ldquo;consisting of&rdquo; and &ldquo;consisting essentially of&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;consisting essentially of&rdquo; means that the composition or process may include additional ingredients or steps, respectively, but only if the additional ingredients or steps do not materially alter the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed compositions or methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As used herein, both &ldquo;spectrophotometric curve&rdquo; and &ldquo;spectral curve&rdquo; refer generally to a plotted curve displaying an ordinate value of relative reflectance versus an abscissa value of wavelength of light, typically within the visual range of 400-700 nm. As used herein, the &ldquo;first derivative&rdquo; of the spectrophotometric curve or spectral curve refers generally to a plotted curve displaying the ordinate values of &Dgr;% R/&Dgr;&lgr; versus an abscissa value of wavelength of light, typically within the visual range of 400-700 nm, wherein R is reflectance and A is wavelength. It is generally known that various perceived colors can be compared, particularly by measuring and plotting the reflectance of light across visible wavelengths to produce a spectral curve. Once the spectral curves of the perceived colors are produced, it is then possible to compare the measured curves for any distinguishing color characteristics that are exhibited by the individual colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Upon comparing the spectral curves of physically admixed and separate and discrete compositions, and the associated first derivatives thereof, the inventors of the present invention have found that these pigmentary systems have different spectral curves, both in terms of absolute reflectance and shape. For instance, the exact same types of colorants within the cosmetic compositions can produce two different spectral curves depending upon how the colorants are physically distributed in the compositions. As used herein, both &ldquo;physical mixture&rdquo; and &ldquo;physically admixed&rdquo; refer generally to the product of admixing or combining two or more components, such as colorants, wherein once mixed, the components are no longer individually discernible or distinguishable from one another. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that if the colorants completely mix, the unique spectral features of each individual colorant can be minimized, whereas if the colorants are kept physically separated and discrete, a different color perception, based in part on the individual spectral features of the colorants, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For instance, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a graph comparing the spectral curve of a silicone elastomer-containing composition comprising discrete color domains and the spectral curve of a physical mixture of colorants within the region of visible light (400 nm to 700 nm). As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the spectral curve of the composition comprising discrete color domains (curve A) and the spectral curve of the composition comprising the physical mixture of colorants (curve B) appear somewhat similar in shape; for instance, both curves exhibit plotted lines generally sloping upward from 400 to 700 nm. However, the present inventors have determined that the general resemblance in shape of spectral curves is not sufficient to predict how a color will be perceived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> tends to indicate that a cosmetic composition comprising a physical mixture of colorants exhibits a spectral curve which appears to generally match or mimic the general shape of the spectral curve of a composition comprising a mixture of separated color domains. However, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts the first derivatives of the spectral curves of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and more clearly exemplifies specific color characteristics along the curves. A comparison of the first derivative curves in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> demonstrates that the first derivative curve of the composition of the physical mixture of colorants (curve B) is substantially different from that of the composition comprising a mixture of separated color domains (curve A), particularly within the region of from about 440 nm to about 530 nm. More particularly, when compared to the first derivative of the spectral curve of the composition comprising the mixture of separated color domains curve (curve A), the composition comprising the physical mixture of colorants (curve B), fails to exemplify all of the unique spectral features of each colorant within the visible light spectrum at the first derivative level. Accordingly, compositions comprising physically mixed colorants (curve B) fail to exhibit all of the color properties exhibited by compositions comprising separated color domains, and thereby appear less natural and/or dull and do not fully exhibit a targeted or desired color tone, effect and/or variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a cosmetic composition has at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant. Moreover, the color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye or when casually observed but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed more closely, for example, under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic compositions of the present invention may be provided by a variety of means and methods and using various types and combinations of two or more color domains. As will be described in further detail below, in one embodiment, the cosmetic compositions of the invention may be adapted for application to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic composition, wherein the applied cosmetic composition comprises at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant. The color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye or when casually observed but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed more closely, for example under magnification. In an alternate embodiment, the cosmetic compositions of the invention may be provided with at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant, wherein the color domains provide the composition with a desired color and wherein a comparative physical mixture of the color domain colorants would provide a mixture color, wherein the AE* between the desired color and the mixture color is greater than 5. These and further embodiments are described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Color Domains </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic compositions of the present invention may comprise two or more discrete color domains for providing the desired skin tone color, effect and/or variation. As used herein, a &ldquo;discrete color domain&rdquo; generally refers to a separate and discrete colored region of space within the cosmetic composition and/or upon delivery of the composition to a substrate, with each separate and discrete color domain individually comprising a color expression within a specified size area. At least two discrete color domains are included in the cosmetic compositions of the present invention. A plurality of discrete color domains may also be combined in the cosmetic compositions. Suitable color domains within the cosmetic compositions are those which may be arranged in such a manner that each discrete domain is capable of separately producing an individual color expression while remaining individually undetected by the human eye at a macroscopic level, i.e. to a casual observer. The two or more color domains in the cosmetic composition cooperate to provide the composition with the desired skin tone color , effect and/or variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The discrete color domains will typically have of an average size of from about 5 &mgr;m to about 500 &mgr;m, although one skilled in the art will appreciate that discrete color domains of sizes outside of this range may also be suitable for providing the desired skin tone color, effect and/or variation. In a more specific embodiment, the discrete color domains have an average size of from about 10 &mgr;m to about 300 &mgr;m, preferably from about 10 &mgr;m to about 200 &mgr;m, more preferably from about 10 &mgr;m to about 100 &mgr;m, and in a further embodiment have an average size of from about 10 &mgr;m to about 70 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the cosmetic compositions comprise at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant. As used herein, &ldquo;colorant&rdquo; generally refers to a dye, pigment, lake or other agent used to impart a color expression to a material. Colorants employed in the present invention, if solid or semisolid, typically have an average size of from about 0.01 &mgr;m to about 500 &mgr;m, preferably from about 0.01 &mgr;m to about 300 &mgr;m, more preferably from about 0.01 &mgr;m to about 100 &mgr;m, even more preferably from about 0.01 &mgr;m to about 70 &mgr;m, and most preferably, from about 0.01 &mgr;m to about 20 &mgr;m. It should be understood that each discrete color domain can consist wholly of a single colorant, or a mixture of two or more colorants, and can optionally further include a carrier for the one or more colorants. It should also be understood that the discrete color domains, which individually comprise at least one colorant, within the cosmetic compositions according to the present invention are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye. As will be explained in more detail below, the entire or overall cosmetic composition itself, which includes the colorants, will optically exhibit a general uniform color tone, effect and/or variation to the casual viewer when observed on a macroscopic level. However, the discrete color domains will remain individually distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed more closely, for example under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Some of the colorants which can be used herein include, but are not limited to, D&amp;C Yellow No. 7, D&amp;C Red No. 36, FD&amp;C Red No. 4, D&amp;C Orange No. 4, D&amp;C Red No. 6, D&amp;C Red No. 34, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, D&amp;C Red No. 33, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, D&amp;C Brown No. 1, D&amp;C Red No. 17, FD&amp;C Green No. 3, D&amp;C Blue No. 4, D&amp;C Yellow No. 8, D&amp;C Orange No. 5, D&amp;C Red No. 22, D&amp;C Red No. 21, D&amp;C Red No. 28, D&amp;C Orange No. 11, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10, D&amp;C Violet No. 2, Ext.

Preferred colorants are selected from the group consistin gof chromium hydroxide green, Yellow 10 Al Lake, Red 27 Al Lake, titanium dioxide, and combinations thereof. Particularly preferred titanium dioxide comprises particles having an average particle size of from about 35 to 60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> To identify colorants suitable for providing physical mixtures of colorants to result in a desired color domain and provide the composition with a desired color tone, effect and/or variation, trial and error, combinatorial experiments and known mathematical models such as the Kubelka-Munk equation may be utilized. See Judd, Deane B., Wyszecki, Gunter, Color in Business, Science and Industry&rdquo;, 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1963.p. 387-426. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cosmetic compositions of the present invention comprise two or more discrete color domains, wherein each color domain comprises at least one colorant. Alternatively, the cosmetic composition may comprise at least two color domains wherein at least one of the color domains comprises a mixture of colorants. As used herein, &ldquo;mixture&rdquo; is meant to include a simple combination of materials and any compounds that may result from their combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic compositions of this invention may alternatively be provided wherein the color domains provide the composition with a desired color, and wherein a comparative physical mixture of the color domain colorants would provide a mixture color, wherein with the &Dgr;E* between the desired color and the mixture color is greater than 5. As used herein, &ldquo;&Dgr;E*&rdquo;&equals;&lsqb;(L*<highlight><subscript>desired</subscript></highlight>&minus;L*<highlight><subscript>mxture</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;(a*<highlight><subscript>desired</subscript></highlight>&minus;a*<highlight><subscript>mixture</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;(b*<highlight><subscript>desired</subscript></highlight>&minus;b*<highlight><subscript>mixture</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>0.5 </superscript></highlight>wherein L* is a measurement of the color intensity, a* is a measure of the red and green quotients, and b* is a measure of the yellow and blue quotients. As used herein, &ldquo;physical mixture&rdquo; is the product of admixing or combining two or more colorants wherein, once mixed, the colorants are no longer individually discernible or distinguishable from one another. Additional preferred values of &Dgr;E* are greater than 10 and even more preferred values of greater than about 15. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will appreciate that the cosmetic compositions comprising two or more color domains may comprise any combination of the various types of color domains described herein. Thus, for example, a first color domain containing a single colorant may be used together with a second color domain containing a mixture of colorants, and/or a third color domain containing one or more colorants and a carrier. Alternatively, similar types of color domains may be employed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, a color domain may comprise a colorant and a carrier. As used herein, &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; generally refers to one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers, diluents, extenders, substrates, mechanisms or the like which carries, transports, conducts or conveys the colorant. Carriers according to the present invention typically have an average size of from about 5 &mgr;m to about 500 &mgr;m, however, it should be understood that one skilled in the art will appreciate that cosmetic compositions may comprise carriers with an average size outside of this range. The type of carrier utilized in a particular product in accordance with the present invention may depend on the type and/or physical form of the product desired. More particularly, the cosmetic compositions of the invention may be of a wide variety of product forms. These include, but are not limited to, waxes, pastes, milks, mousses, tonics, powders, solid sticks, gels, lotions, creams and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Carrier </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention may comprise a safe and effective amount of a dermatologically acceptable carrier within which a colorant, physical mixtures, and optional other ingredients are incorporated to enable such materials to be delivered to the skin in an appropriate concentration. As used herein, &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; generally refers to one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers, diluents, extenders, substrates, mechanisms or the like which carries, transports, conducts or conveys the colorant. The carrier can thus act as a diluent, dispersant, solvent, or the like for a particulate material. In one embodiment, a color domain may comprise a colorant and a carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The carrier may contain one or more dermatologically acceptable solid, semi-solid or liquid fillers, diluents, solvents, extenders and the like. The carrier may be solid, semi-solid or liquid. The carrier can itself be inert or it can possess dermatological benefits of its own. Concentrations of the carrier can vary with the carrier selected and the intended concentrations of the essential and optional components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Suitable carriers include conventional or otherwise known carriers that are dermatologically acceptable. The carrier should also be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, and should not unduly impair stability, efficacy or other use benefits associated with the compositions of the present invention. Preferred components of the compositions of this invention should be capable of being commingled in a manner such that there is no interaction that would substantially reduce the efficacy of the composition under ordinary use situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The colorants of the present compositions may be formed by incorporation of the colorants into the carrier that results in the combined carrier/colorant having color. For the purposes of this invention, &ldquo;incorporation&rdquo; is used to described any method capable of accomplishing a combined colorant/carrier composition.

As used herein, &ldquo;diluent&rdquo; includes materials in which the particulate material can be dispersed, dissolved, or otherwise incorporated. Nonlimiting examples of hydrophilic diluents are water, organic hydrophilic diluents such as lower monovalent alcohols (e.g., C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and low molecular weight glycols and polyols, including propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (e.g., Molecular Weight 200-600 g/mole), polypropylene glycol (e.g., Molecular Weight 425-2025 g/mole), glycerol, butylene glycol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, sorbitol esters, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethanol, isopropanol, sorbitol esters, butanediol, ether propanol, ethoxylated ethers, propoxylated ethers and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Preferred carriers comprise an emulsion comprising a hydrophilic phase comprising a hydrophilic component, e.g., water or other hydrophilic diluent, and a hydrophobic phase comprising a hydrophobic component, e.g., a lipid, oil or oily material. As well known to one skilled in the art, the hydrophilic phase will be dispersed in the hydrophobic phase, or vice versa, to form respectively hydrophilic or hydrophobic dispersed and continuous phases, depending on the composition ingredients. In emulsion technology, the term &ldquo;dispersed phase&rdquo; is a term well-known to one skilled in the art which means that the phase exists as small particles or droplets that are suspended in and surrounded by a continuous phase. The dispersed phase is also known as the internal or discontinuous phase. The emulsion may be or comprise (e.g., in a triple or other multi-phase emulsion) an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion such as a water-in-silicone emulsion. Oil-in-water emulsions typically comprise from about 1% to about 50% (preferably about 1% to about 30%) of the dispersed hydrophobic phase and from about 1% to about 98% (preferably from about 40% to about 90%) of the continuous hydrophilic phase; water-in-oil emulsions typically comprise from about 1% to about 98% (preferably from about 40% to about 90%) of the dispersed hydrophilic phase and from about 1% to about 50% (preferably about 1% to about 30%) of the continuous hydrophobic phase. The emulsion may also comprise a gel network, such as described in G. M. Eccleston, Application of Emulsion Stability Theories to Mobile and Semisolid O/W Emulsions, Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries, Vol. 101, November 1996, pp. 73-92, incorporated herein by reference.

The term &ldquo;emulsifying,&rdquo; as used herein, means crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer having at least one polyoxyalkylene unit. Emulsifying crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer can notably be chosen from the crosslinked polymers described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,412,004 (issued May 2, 1995); 5,837,793 (issued Nov. 17, 1998); and 5,811,487 (issued Sep. 22, 1998), all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Particularly useful emulsifying elastomers are polyoxyalkylene modified elastomers formed from divinyl compounds, particularly siloxane polymers with at least two free vinyl groups, reacting with Si&mdash;H linkages on a polysiloxane backbone. Preferably, the elastomers are dimethyl polysiloxanes crosslinked by Si&mdash;H sites on a molecularly spherical MQ resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferred carriers may also comprise a colloidal dispersion. A colloidal dispersion, by definition, is a two phase system that comprises a dispersed phase and a dispersion medium. The state of the dispersed phase (gas, solid, or liquid) in the dispersion medium defines the system as a foam, suspension, or emulsion. The particle size of the dispersed phase further defines the system as a colloidal dispersion versus suspension and microemulsion versus macroemulsion. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Delivery Means </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As mentioned herein relative to the phrase &ldquo;cosmetic compositions&rdquo;, the cosmetic compositions of the present invention may be adapted for delivery to a defined surface via a delivery mechanism. For example, suitable delivery mechanisms include, but are not limited to, colloidal systems, delivery substrates, i.e., applicator pads, sponges, open cell foams, brushes, packages, spraying devices and printing devices. More specifically, delivery devices such as electrostatic spraying devices, air-spraying devices, ink jet print heads, lithographic devices or stamp pads are suitable for use herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the cosmetic compositions of the invention are adapted for application to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic composition, the applied cosmetic composition comprising at least two discrete color domains, each of which comprises at least one colorant. The color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye or when casually observed but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed more closely, for example under magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, at least two color domains are provided in a cosmetic composition adapted for application to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic composition having a spectrophotometric curve exhibiting various first derivative characteristics. In this embodiment, the cosmetic composition adapted for application is not required to itself have a spectrophotometric curve exhibiting the desired first derivative characteristics before delivery. Rather, it is only required that the composition is adapted to provide, for example, via a delivery mechanism, an applied cosmetic composition having a spectrophotometric curve having the desired first derivative characteristics. Thus, in this instance, the delivery mechanism alters the cosmetic composition in such a manner prior to application to the target substrate that the desired characteristics are achieved upon delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> More particularly, this embodiment includes cosmetic compositions adapted for application to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic composition having a spectrophotometric curve, wherein the applied cosmetic composition comprises at least two colorants, and wherein the spectrophotometric curve of the applied composition has a first derivative in which (a) a maximum peak in the region of from about 420 nm to about 650 nm occurs at a wavelength of from about 570 nm to about 630 nm, and (b) a minimum valley in the region of from about 520 nm to about 580 nm has a &Dgr;% R/&Dgr;&lgr; of less than or equal to about 0.03, wherein R is reflectance and &Dgr; is wavelength, and wherein the first derivative of the spectrophotometric curve of the cosmetic composition before delivery does not exhibit (a) or (b). In such instances, it is preferred that &Dgr;% R/&Dgr;&lgr; is less than or equal to about 0.015, and most preferably, less than or equal to about 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For example, a cosmetic composition may be packaged in a manner such that the color domains of each color are not intermixed therein; however, the cosmetic composition is adapted for delivery to the desired substrate, i.e., skin, via a delivery mechanism, i.e. a spray device, including a mechanical sprayer or an electrostatic sprayer, an applicator pad, or the like, which affects intermixing of the color domains in a manner sufficient to provide the applied cosmetic composition with the desired spectrophotometric curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Optional Ingredients </paragraph>

The co-solubilizer is especially useful to bridge compatibility of two materials which are normally incompatible, resulting in the creation of a single, stable phase. Co-solubilizers may therefore be particularly preferred in the single phase electrostatically sprayable compositions described herein. When used, compositions of the invention typically comprise from about 0.5% to about 10%, preferably from about 1% to about 5%, more preferably from about 1.5% to about 3% co-solubilizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Suitable co-solubilizers are best chosen using a solubility parameter scale as is described in &ldquo;Solubility: Effects in Product, Package, Penetration, and Preservation,&rdquo; by C. D. Vaughan, <highlight><italic>Cosmetics and Toiletries</italic></highlight>, Vol. 103, Ocober 1988. Based on the solubility parameter of two incompatible materials, a third material with a solubility parameter in between, that of the two incompatible materials may sometimes be found which is independently compatible with the two incompatible materials. When all three materials are then combined, they may exhibit the properties of a single stable phase, as could be measured, visually for example, via a light microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Co-solubilizers can be polar fluids, non-polar fluids, polar aprotic solvents, or amphiphilic materials and are chosen from these broad categories to fit the needs of the two incompatible materials to create a single phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Particularly useful co-solubilizers include the polydiorganosiloxane-polyoxyalkylene copolymers described, including the polymers described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,268,499, as well as the surfactants disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,722. Dimethicone copolyol is preferred. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to methods for providing cosmetic compositions having a desired color tone effect and/or variation. In one embodiment, a cosmetic composition with a desired color is provided by a method that comprises the step of adding at least two discrete color domains, each of which has at least one colorant, to a cosmetic composition. The color domains are not readily discernible individually to the naked eye but are distinguishable within the cosmetic composition when viewed under magnification. In a specific embodiment, the color of the cosmetic composition may be substantially similar to a target color. In another specific embodiment, the color of the cosmetic composition has a spectrophotometric curve that is substantially similar to a spectrophotometric curve of a target color. In still another specific embodiment, a first derivative of a spectrophometric curve of a cosmetic composition is substantially similar to a first derivative of a spectrophotometric curve of a target color. Another embodiment includes a method for providing a cosmetic composition that is adapted for delivery to a substrate to provide an applied cosmetic composition of the present invention. Further, this invention relates to a method of delivering to a substrate any of the cosmetic compositions of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Applicants have additionally found that the compositions of the present invention are useful in a variety of applications directed to enhancing the appearance of target substrates like skin, oral mucosa, hair, nails, lips, and cuticles. The methods of use for the compositions disclosed and claimed herein include, but are not limited to: 1) methods of improving the natural appearance of skin; 2) methods of applying a color cosmetic to skin, lips, and/or nails; 3) methods of providing UV protection to skin, lips, and/or nails; 4) methods of masking the appearance of cellulite, 5) methods of preventing, retarding, and/or controlling the appearance of oil; 6) methods of modifying the feel and texture of skin; 7) methods of providing even skin tone; 8) methods of masking the appearance of spider vessels and varicose veins; 9) methods of masking the appearance of vellus hair on skin; 10) methods of concealing blemishes and/or imperfections in human skin, including pimples, acne, age spots, freckles, moles, scars, under eye circles, birth marks, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, etc.; 11) methods of enhancing or modifying skin color such as lightening, darkening, making more pink, making more yellow, making less dull, making less ashy, making less orange, making more radiant; 12) methods of artificial tanning; 13) methods of concealing vitiligo; 14) methods of concealing damage incurred to the skin as a result of trauma, e.g., cosmetic surgery, burns, stretching of skin, etc., and 15) methods of concealing wrinkles, fine lines, pores, uneven skin surfaces, etc. Each of the methods discussed herein involve topical application of the claimed compositions to the target substrate, particularly skin. </paragraph>
