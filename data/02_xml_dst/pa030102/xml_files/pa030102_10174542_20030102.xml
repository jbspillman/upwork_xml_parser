<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This application claims the priority of German Patent Application Serial No. 199 60 699.4, filed Dec. 16, 1999, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d), the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to a suspension strut for use in a wheel suspension of an automotive vehicle, and more particularly to a suspension strut bearing for a suspension strut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The wheel suspension or wheel control for each of the steered front wheels of motor vehicles includes a suspension strut which includes a telescopic shock absorber and a coil spring which operates a wheel spring and is disposed in surrounding relationship to the shock absorber. The shock absorber and the coil spring are supported elastically by the vehicle body and are borne together in a suspension strut bearing with respect to the vehicle body for rotation about their longitudinal axis. The suspension strut bearing allows a rotation between the shock absorber and the attached spring disk, on the one hand, and the vehicle body, on the other hand, when the wheel are turned for steering purposes. The further spring end of the coil spring is so supported by the shock absorber as to be constraint against rotation. The resistance against turning can be kept small by incorporating a roller bearing in the suspension strut bearing in order to enhance the steering comfort and to prevent an inadvertent spring torsion and resultant return moments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A wheel control or suspension for front wheels is described in German Pat. No. DE 29 13 982. The wheel suspension has a shock absorber with a piston rod whose upper bearing journal has attached thereon an axial roller bearing to ensure a rotation of the suspension strut relative to the vehicle body. The lower ring of the axial roller bearing is supported via a spring disk by the piston rod of the shock absorber as well as by the associated coil spring. Forces applied by the shock absorber and the coil spring and acting on the roller bearing are transmitted from the roller bearing via an elastic support bearing onto the vehicle body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> German patent publication DE 197 52 268 describes a suspension strut bearing having two carrier elements and a roller bearing positioned between the carrier elements. A first one of the carrier elements is secured to the vehicle body so as to be constraint against rotation and has fitted therein a bearing ring of the roller bearing. The first carrier element has a rotation-symmetrical, circular ring shaped configuration and has on the outside an axially projecting wall which extends over the entire assembly height of the roller bearing. On its free end, the wall of this rotation-fixed carrier element engages behind a radially outwardly directed collar of the second carrier element for placement of a second bearing ring. The second carrier element is made of sheet steel and has a roller bearing distal side which supports on the outside the coil spring of the suspension strut. The suspension strut is further provided with a damping element for realizing an elastic end stop at severe spring compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable and advantageous to provide an improved suspension strut bearing which is cost-efficient and which is compact in structure and weight-optimized while exhibiting improved stiffness. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a suspension strut used in a wheel suspension of an automotive vehicle, includes a shock absorber, a suspension strut bearing defining a longitudinal axis, and a coil spring arranged at least in part in coaxial surrounding relationship to the shock absorber and having opposite spring ends, one spring end supported by an abutment of the shock absorber, wherein the suspension strut bearing includes a pair of carrier elements made of plastic material, and a roller bearing positioned between the carrier elements, one of the carrier elements configured as a guide ring connected to a body of the vehicle, and the other carrier element configured as a single-piece housing having incorporated therein plural hollow chambers in partial concentric surrounding relationship to the shock absorber and formed with a guide collar as well as a support surface for support of the other end of the coil spring, wherein the guide ring has a radially inner collar and a radially outer collar which together define a ring groove therebetween for receiving the roller bearing, whereby the roller bearing is centered on at least one of the collars, with the collars extending at least beyond a midsection of the roller bearing, wherein the radially inner collar is configured for engagement in a recess of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention resolves prior art deficiencies by incorporating a roller bearing between two carrier elements, which are made of plastic. The use of such carrier elements has weight advantages, when compared with a spring disk, and can be made through an injection molding process on a large scale, resulting in significant cost advantages. Without adversely affecting the strength, the carrier elements can be so constructed as to be optimized with respect to weight, installation space and strength. Suitably, one carrier element represents a housing, which is associated to the coil spring of the suspension strut and includes hollow chambers to realize the weight advantage. The hollow chambers further allow identical wall thickness of the carrier element in all regions. Same cross section avoids varying shrinkage behavior and thus allows maintaining narrow shape tolerances and positioning tolerances. Examples of suitable plastics for the carrier elements include PA 66 GF or PA 66 GB. On the coil spring proximal side, the respective carrier element is provided with a guide collar and a support surface for the coil spring. The support surface of the carrier element is hereby so arranged as to realize a substantial rectilinear force introduction into the suspension strut bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Suitably, the guide collar of the housing has an axial length which exceeds a at least the length extension of one spring winding of the coil spring to thereby realize a sufficient guidance of the coil spring. The end portion of the coil spring has hereby a decreasing winding diameter for surrounding the guide collar of the housing, so that the coil spring is guided longitudinally on the inside of the guide collar and centered at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the housing may have a ring shoulder, which extends inwards from the guide collar. Supported by the ring shoulder is a damping element for providing an elastic end stop for the suspension strut, in a situation, when the vehicle results in a severe spring compression. The ring shoulder may have a circular ring shaped configuration and extends perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the suspension strut bearing. The configuration of the ring shoulder in conjunction with the guide collar is suitable to realize a disposition of the damping element such that the damping element is held and centered in form-fitting connection upon an inner wall of the guide collar. As an alternative, the damping element may also abut against the ring shoulder and held with play in the guide collar so that an annular gap is formed between the outer surface area of the damping element and the inside wall of the guide collar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A support of the damping element upon the ring shoulder has the effect that steering forces do not increase excessively, even in extreme situations, i.e., upon a severe spring compression or extreme speed in curves that may lead to a locking of the suspension strut. As a result of the support of the damping element upon the ring shoulder of the housing, which in turn is supported via the roller bearing by the neighboring carrier element, manageable steering forces are encountered, even when the suspension strut locks up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the support surface of the housing may form a stop member for restraining in a simple manner the coil spring against rotation, when assembled. One spring end of the coil spring is hereby supported by the stop member and thus positions the coil spring in the assembled state. The support surface may ascend continuously at an angle in axial direction from the stop member in circumferential direction at least over a 90&deg; area. This angular zone may, optionally, also be extended to a range of greater than 90&deg;. The ascension pattern on the support surface or the angle of inclination corresponds hereby to the end winding of the coil spring. As a consequence, a faulty installation of coil springs having varying spring ends is precluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The carrier element associated to the coil spring may further form a ring shoulder which is disposed in radially inwardly offset relationship to the guide collar and provided to support the damping element for the suspension strut. Thus, this carrier element assumes several functions, a fact that is especially advantageous, when installation of the individual components of the suspension strut is involved. As a consequence of the position of the ring shoulder in the housing, which substantially corresponds to the position of the support surface for the coil spring, the damping element can be reduced in size compared to conventional constructions, thereby contributing to a more compact structure of the suspension strut bearing according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the housing has a side, which is distal to the support surface for the coil spring and is formed with a circumferential groove for placement of a roller bearing ring. The other bearing ring of the roller bearing is associated to the other carrier element, the guide ring, which is rigidly secured to the body of the vehicle. The guide ring may include hereby two collars for positively retaining the bearing ring therebetween. Both collars have a longitudinal dimension that extends at least beyond the midsection of the roller bearing, when assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the radially outer collar of the guide ring may engage, in assembled state, in a recess which neighbors the suspension strut bearing designed as axial bearing. The radially outer collar may include a locking nose for engagement in a radial groove of an outer wall of the housing for realizing a snap connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The form-fitting or positive connection of the carrier elements by means of a snap connection disposed between the housing and the guide ring results in a pre-assembled unit in which all components of the suspension strut bearing are joined together. Therefore, the vehicle manufacturer may be supplied with a pre-assembled suspension strut bearing as a unitary structure to thereby significantly reduce the number of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the snap connection may be constructed to form a labyrinth-type sealing gap. In this way, the suspension strut bearing is protected from ingress of contaminants of all kinds. This benefits the service life of the suspension strut bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the hollow chambers of the housing may be spaced about the circumference of the housing. These hollow chambers are so configured to have substantially same cross sections in the housing. As a result, same shrinkage behavior of the housing, made of plastic, is realized throughout, thereby positively affecting the shaping tolerance and positioning tolerance and in general the accuracy in shape or manufacturing tolerance of the entire housing. The hollow chambers also result in a reduction in weight, without adversely affecting the strength. Suitably, the housing has hollow chambers in symmetric relationship, which are separated by intermediate walls radiating toward the middle of the suspension strut bearing so that the hollow chambers exhibit a trapezoidal configuration. It is also possible to provide each hollow chamber with a partition wall to ensure an axial separation of the hollow chambers. Of course, the housing may also include hollow chambers, which are disposed in radially spaced-apart relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the present invention, the hollow chambers of the housing may extend in axial direction up to the guide collar which is provided to support on the outside one end of the coil spring. In this way, the guide collar is ensured to have a same wall thickness, even in the tapered portion thereof to realize an even shrinkage behavior.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Throughout all the Figures, same or corresponding elements are generally indicated by same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawing, and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a longitudinal section of a suspension strut according to the present invention, generally designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The suspension strut <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a shock absorber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a piston rod <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is supported by a vehicle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via an elastic bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Disposed on the vehicle body distal side of the bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a suspension strut bearing, generally designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and positively fitted in a receptacle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The suspension strut bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> defines a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and includes two carrier elements in the form of a guide ring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which abuts against the bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is situated at axial distance to the guide ring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A roller bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed between the guide ring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and includes a bearing ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is received in an annular groove <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the guide ring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a bearing ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is received in a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and rolling elements <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; guided between the bearing rings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> includes a support surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in axially offset relationship to the circumferential groove <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for supporting one end of a coil spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The support surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> extends in radial relationship to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the suspension strut bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and connects via a curved transition into an axial guide collar <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The curved transition has a radius that conforms to the spring wire diameter of the coil spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in detail, the coil spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with a conical end zone whose end windings abut against the outer surface of the guide collar <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The support surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is so situated on the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that a substantial rectilinear force introduction into the suspension strut bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is established so that the possibility of a tilted disposition is essentially eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Both, the guide ring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, are made of plastic, e.g. PA 66 GF or PA 66 GB, and thus have weight advantages compared to conventional suspension strut bearings. The housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is hereby formed with hollow chambers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to thereby prevent different shrinkage behavior as a consequence of changes in wall thickness so as to realize a precise dimensional shape. The hollow chambers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have different geometric configurations and are separated from one another by intermediate walls <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> further includes a ring shoulder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which extends radially inwards from the guide collar <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and is provided for support of a damping element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which establishes an elastic end stop for the suspension strut <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, when, for example, a severe spring compression of the vehicle is encountered. The housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is hereby so configured that the ring shoulder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the support surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are spaced in axial direction from the roller bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at substantially same distance. Compared to conventional suspension struts, the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has a compact structure and the damping element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be constructed of reduced length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cutaway view, on an enlarged scale, of the suspension strut <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, showing in detail the area of the suspension strut bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The guide ring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a substantially inverted U-shaped configuration and includes a radially inner collar <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a radially outer collar <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When the suspension strut bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is assembled, the inner collar <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> engages in a recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereas the outer collar <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has such a longitudinal dimension as to extend beyond the assembly height of the roller bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and terminates in a radially inwardly directed projection <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which engages a radial groove <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the housing to thereby form a snap connection, generally labeled by reference numeral <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The projection <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an axial length sufficient to establish the formation of a labyrinth-type sealing gap <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> between the projection <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the outer contour of the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The labyrinth-type sealing gap <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> effectively prevents the ingress of contaminants into the suspension strut bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the intermediate walls <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for lateral demarcation of the hollow chambers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are disposed in a radiating manner, thereby defining a trapezoidal configuration of the hollow chambers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The hollow chambers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are arranged symmetrically about the circumference of the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and extend from a central cylindrical recess <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a direction of a centered middle of the housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
