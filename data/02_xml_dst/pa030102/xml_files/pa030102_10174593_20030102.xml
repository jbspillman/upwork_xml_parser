<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally as indicated to a hydraulic motor and, more particularly, to a hydraulic motor with a gerotor drive assembly which provides rotational motion to a desired piece of machinery. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A hydraulic motor is a converter of pressurized oil flow into torque and speed for transferring rotational motion to a desired piece of machinery. Of particular relevance to the present invention is a hydraulic motor, wherein this conversion is accomplished by a drive assembly having a gerotor set. A gerotor motor can provide a combination of compact size, low manufacturing cost, and high torque capacity, thereby making it a very popular choice for heavy duty applications requiring low speeds (e.g., 1000 rpm or less) and high torques (e.g., 15,000 In-Lb or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A gerotor set comprises an outer stator and an inner rotor having different centers with a fixed eccentricity. The stator has internal teeth or &ldquo;vanes&rdquo; which form circular arcs, and the inner rotor has one less external &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; or lobes. The rotor lobes remain in contact with the circular arcs as the rotor moves relative to the stator, and these continuous multi-location contacts create fluid pockets which sequentially expand and contract. As fluid is supplied and exhausted from the fluid pockets in a timed relationship, the rotor moves hypocycloidally (i.e., orbits and rotates) relative to the stator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A drive link is interconnected to the rotor for movement therewith, and this interconnection usually constitutes crowned external splines on the drive link which engage with internal splines on the rotor. Such a splined mating arrangement allows the drive link to &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; during operation of the motor. To prevent the drive link from slipping axially backward out of the splined engagement, an axial stop can be provided adjacent the rear end (or nose portion) of the drive link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The drive assembly of a gerotor motor will typically include a valving system to supply and exhaust the fluid from the gerotor pockets in the desired timed relationship. One common type of valving system includes a disk-type commutator and a stationary valve member (e.g., a manifold). A slow-speed commutator rotates at the speed of rotation of the rotor, and manifold channels are opened/closed in the angular circumferential direction using edges of the valve openings. A fast-speed commutator orbits with the rotor and the commutator&apos;s inner diameter and outer diameter control fluid metering. Generally, a fast-speed commutator is preferred because it allows valving to be synchronized with the volume changes of the gerotor fluid pockets (rather than rotation of the shaft), thereby significantly reducing timing errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The use of a commutator creates the potential for cross-port leakage (e.g., flow bypasses the drive assembly) at the interface between the commutator and an end cover. To prevent such cross-port leakage, a groove can be formed in the back axial face of the commutator and a triangular or trapezoidal (in cross-section) sealing ring positioned therein. The sealing ring is usually oversized (e.g., the height of the ring is greater than the depth of the groove) so that, when the motor is at rest, the ring projects outwardly from the groove. Upon start-up of the motor, the hydraulic imbalance pushes the sealing ring out of the groove to perform the sealing at the interface between the commutator and end cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The drive link is interconnected to a shaft to transfer rotational movement thereto. For example, the motor can include a coupling shaft which is connected to the drive link (e.g., by a splined interconnection) and which can be coupled to the input shaft of the desired piece of machinery. In this case, the drive assembly (e.g., the commutator, the manifold and the gerotor set) is commonly positioned between the motor&apos;s end cover and a housing which rotatably supports the coupling shaft. Alternatively, the shaft can be part of the gearbox of the desired machinery and the drive link is directly coupled thereto. In this case, the drive assembly is commonly positioned between the motor&apos;s end cover and a mountable housing for attachment to the gearbox. In either case, a plurality of bolts extend through registered openings in the end cover, the drive assembly and the housing to clamp these components together. A wear plate can be positioned between the drive assembly and the housing, and the clamping bolts can also extend therethrough. Face seals are provided between the various components to prevent leakage at the interfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A hydraulic motor will have a flow circuit which determines the path of fluid flow and can be viewed as defining a cylindrical pressure vessel. The diameter of the pressure vessel is determined by the outermost radial reach of the fluid circuit, and the length of the pressure vessel is determined by the longest axial reach of the fluid circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The flow circuit of a hydraulic motor includes a working path which extends between the inlet port and the outlet port and through which the fluid passes to cause the drive assembly to rotate the output shaft in the appropriate direction. When the motor is operating in a first direction, the first port is the inlet port and the second port is the outlet port and the output shaft rotates in a first direction (e.g., clockwise). When the motor is operating in a second direction, the second port is the inlet port and the first port is the outlet port and the output shaft rotates in a second direction (e.g., counterclockwise). In either case, the inlet port can be connected to a pump discharge and the outlet port can be connected to a return line to a reservoir which feeds the pump suction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In most hydraulic motor designs, the working path extends through non-working portions of the motor (e.g., the housing and/or an axial passageway in the drive link), whereby the length of the working path extends for a substantial distance of the pressure vessel. Also, most hydraulic motors have a &ldquo;wet bolt&rdquo; design, wherein the clamping-bolt openings double as fluid passageways and face seals are located radially outside the diameter of the circular array of clamping bolts. This arrangement results in the diameter of the pressure vessel occupying a substantial portion of the motor&apos;s radial dimension, and requires the clamping bolts to directly absorb corresponding forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The flow circuit of a hydraulic motor will usually also include a non-working path, including chambers surrounding the drive train components (i.e., the drive link and the coupling shaft) and through which fluid passes for cooling and lubrication of these components. In a two-pressure-zone motor design, fluid traveling through the non-working path rejoins fluid traveling through the working path somewhere upstream of the outlet port. In a three-pressure-zone motor design, fluid traveling through the non-working path does not rejoin the working path and exits the motor through a separate case drain in the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A three-pressure-zone motor design is used in applications where contamination flushing must be performed. Additionally or alternatively, a three-pressure-zone design is used for applications in which the drive link is coupled directly to the input shaft of a gearbox. Otherwise, a two-pressure-zone motor design usually is employed because it simplifies plumbing criteria, reduces reservoir size requirements, decreases pump capacity demands, and minimizes the risk of &ldquo;dead zones&rdquo; within the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Some of the most significant considerations when selecting a hydraulic motor, especially for heavy-duty applications, include the motor&apos;s no-load pressure drop (or mechanical efficiency), its life expectancy, its start-up (or breakaway) efficiency, and/or its torque capacity. Accordingly, motor manufacturers are constantly trying to improve upon these performance parameters. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a hydraulic motor which, when compared to conventional hydraulic motors, can be constructed to have an improved no-load pressure drop, a longer life expectancy, a better start-up efficiency and/or a higher torque capacity. The motor can be especially well suited for heavy-duty applications requiring low speeds and high torques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention provides a hydraulic motor comprising an end cover, a drive link, a drive assembly, and a flow circuit extending between a first port and a second port. The flow circuit comprises a working path through which fluid flows to cause the drive assembly to hypocycloidally move the drive link in a first direction when the first port is the inlet port and in a second direction when the second port is the inlet port. When the motor is operating in a first direction, the fluid flows in a first direction through the working path of the fluid circuit and, when the motor is operating in a second direction, the fluid flows in a second direction through the working path of the fluid circuit. The motor can be designed to operate in only one direction (either the first or the second) or can be designed to operate in both directions. The flow circuit can also comprise a non-working path passing through chambers surrounding the drive link to cool and lubricate the drive train components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, the first port and the second port are part of the end cover, and the working path is axially confined to a length between the end cover and the drive assembly. As such, the working fluid is not subjected to no-load pressure drops from unnecessary travel through non-working portions of the motor. This confinement of the working path results in a significantly reduced pressure drop (e.g., 50% less) when compared to conventional hydraulic motors of similar size and/or capacity and this translates into a dramatic improvement in motor efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the clamping bolts are radially positioned outside of the motor&apos;s pressure vessel and, in any event, they do not communicate with any of the motor&apos;s fluid chambers. This radially outward positioning of the clamping bolts, or &ldquo;dry bolt&rdquo; design, results in less axial tensile stress per bolt for a motor design having a given number of clamping bolts. Additionally or alternatively, because fluid flow characteristics do not play a part in bolt placement, more clamping bolts can be used in a given motor design. Less strain-per-bolt and/or more bolts-per-motor result in less bolt-stretching and equal bi-directional motor performance which, in turn, results in a longer motor life. Furthermore, this &ldquo;dry bolt&rdquo; design avoids the extra manufacturing cost of countersink machining which is required in a &ldquo;wet bolt&rdquo; design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a non-interference seal arrangement is used at the valving interface between the end cover and the drive assembly. In this arrangement, a sealing ring is positioned in a groove in the commutator. The height of the sealing ring is less than the depth of the groove, whereby the seal does not project outwardly from the groove when the motor is at rest. Also, the groove and seal can each have a roughly rectangular cross-sectional shape such that the ring resides loosely within the groove when the motor is at rest and then, upon start-up of the motor, is appropriately moved to a position which prevents cross-port leakage. Specifically, the seal is pushed rearward by hydraulic imbalance forces and is pushed in the appropriate radial direction by the port-to-port pressure differential. With an oversized seal, mechanical friction is created between the seal and the end cover during startup or very slow speed operation (e.g., <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rpm or less). With the sealing arrangement of the present invention, this mechanical friction is eliminated thereby enhancing start-up and low speed efficiency and increasing the life of the sealing ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the invention, an axial stop for the drive link is mounted on a moving part of the drive assembly and, more particularly, is preassembled on an internal diameter of the rotor. When the axial stop is mounted on a stationary component of the motor (e.g., the end cover), the drive link will rotate/orbit relative to the axial stop, thereby creating internal mechanical friction therebetween. However, with the axial stop system of the present invention, this internal friction is eliminated, thereby improving the motor&apos;s startup efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the invention, the drive link has an axial passageway which allows a component of the drive train (e.g., a coupling shaft) to centrifugally pump a diverted portion of fluid from the working path through the non-working path. Regardless of whether the motor is operating in the first direction or the second direction, the diverted portion of the fluid is centrifugally pumped through the non-working path in the same direction by the output shaft. When the motor is operating in the first direction, the non-working portion of the fluid is diverted from the high pressure (pre-working) fluid and, when the motor is operating in the second direction, the non-working portion of the fluid is diverted from the low pressure (post-worked) fluid. This non-working path is believed to provide superior lubrication for the splined interconnection between the drive link and the rotor and/or the splined interconnection between the drive link and the output shaft. Since, in general, the torque capacity of a motor is limited by the condition of its drive train components, this superior lubrication arrangement can greatly enhance the performance of a motor. This aspect of the invention finds particular application in two-pressure-zone motor designs but can also be used in three-pressure-zone motor designs as well. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and initially to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in a first direction (e.g., the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise), the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is the inlet port and the second port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is the outlet port. When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in a second opposite direction (e.g., the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates counterclockwise), the second port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is the inlet port and the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is the outlet port. In either case, the inlet port can be connected to a pump discharge and the outlet port can be connected to a return line to a reservoir which feeds the pump suction. In response to pressurized fluid passing from the inlet port to the outlet port through a working fluid path, the drive assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> hypocycloidally moves (i.e., orbits and rotates) the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates in a corresponding direction. The motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not include a case drain whereby it has a two pressure zone design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The drive assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises a commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is positioned in a space between the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for movement with the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during operation of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the illustrated commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a fast-speed commutator which orbits at the orbiting speed of the moving member of the gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (namely its rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, introduced below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises an inner ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an outer ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and spoke-like members extending between the rings so that the commutator&apos;s inner diameter and outer diameter can control fluid metering. The inner ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> captures a portion of the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (namely its nose portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> introduced below). The outer ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> divides the space between the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into a first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which communicates with the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which communicates with the second port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As can best be seen by referring additionally to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the axial face of the outer commutator ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> adjacent the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which houses a sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be made of a polyimide resin, such as VESPEL&reg; which is a trademark of DuPont for a temperature-resistant thermosetting polyimide resin. In any event, the depth of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is greater than the height of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> whereby there will be no mechanical friction between the seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at very low speed operation of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as is found, for example, with an oversized commutator seal. This elimination of internal friction enhances the starting efficiency of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and increases the life of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> each have substantially rectangular cross-sectional shape and the width of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is also greater than the width of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is at rest (i.e., not operating), the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> resides loosely within the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>.) However, when the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the first direction, and high pressure fluid is introduced into the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the high pressure fluid presses the radially outer side of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> against the radially outer side of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Also, the imbalance between the hydraulic forces on the rear and the front of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> cause it to be pushed axially rearward towards the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>.) Likewise, when the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the second direction, and high pressure fluid is introduced into the second chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the high pressure fluid presses the radially inward side of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> against the radially inner side of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Again, the imbalance between the hydraulic forces on the rear and the front of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> cause it to be pushed axially rearward towards the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a first set of channels which extend between the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a second set of channels which extend between the second chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The number of channels in each set and their circumferential spacing corresponds to the fluid pockets formed by the gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and these channels are systematically opened and closed by the commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as it is moved with the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is made from a plurality of layers which are laminated together in a certain stacked arrangement to form the flow channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> comprises a stator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having different centers with a fixed eccentricity. The stator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has internal teeth or &ldquo;vanes&rdquo; which form circular arcs and the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has one less external &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; or lobes. As fluid is supplied and exhausted from the fluid pockets in a timed relationship, the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> moves hypocycloidally (i.e., orbits and rotates) relative to the stator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The illustrated gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is a 8&times;9 gerotor set, that is, the stator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has nine vanes and the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has eight teeth, and these components cooperate to form nine fluid pockets. When compared to, for example, a 6&times;7 gerotor set, the 8&times;9 gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> allows a larger drive link to be assembled inside the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereby providing a higher torque capacity. Also, the 8&times;9 gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> allows a lower eccentricity (e.g., 3 mm) for a desired displacement capacity thereby providing smoother rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and better spline engagement between the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. That being said, other gerotor designs (e.g., a 6&times;7 gerotor set) are possible with, and contemplated by, the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The shaft housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a central bore <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in which the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported. The central bore <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has portions of varying diameters to accommodate the stepped profile of the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as well as radial bearings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and thrust bearings <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A fluid chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> surrounds the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the bore <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a fluid-tight seal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent leakage therefrom. A dirt seal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can also be provided at the exposed axial end face of the shaft housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a nose portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> captured within the commutator inner ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an externally splined intermediate portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which mates with internal splines on the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and an externally splined end portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which mates with an internal splines on the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A fluid chamber <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, in communication with the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, surrounds the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as it extends through the manifold <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the wear plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and into a portion (namely a sleeve portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> introduced below) of the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also includes a passageway <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> extending between its axial ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As is best seen by referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an axial stop member (e.g., a metal washer) is mounted on the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> adjacent its splined portion and held in position by a snap ring <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The axial stop <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has an annular shape and its inner diameter is greater than the diameter of the nose portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> but less than the diameter of its splined portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In this manner, possible axial movement of the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> towards the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is prevented. By mounting the axial stop <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> on a component which moves with the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, internal mechanical friction therebetween is minimized as compared to when the axial stop <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is mounted on the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the use of the inner rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as an axial stop translates into an enhancement of the motor&apos;s start-up efficiency. Also, since an axial stop does not have to be positioned in the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, flow area within this chamber is optimized thereby further enhancing the no-load pressure drop characteristics (i.e., mechanical efficiency) of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a rear portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which projects outwardly from the shaft housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a wider front sleeve portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which receives the end portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes an axial passageway <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which extends from the internal end face of the sleeve portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to a radial passageway <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> communicating with the shaft-surrounding chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> surrounding the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends into the sleeve portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has radial passageways <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which connects the chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the chamber <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, the fluid circuit for the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is schematically shown when the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is respectively operating in a first direction (e.g. the shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise) and in a second direction (e.g., the shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates counterclockwise). In these schematic illustrations, high pressure regions (pre-working) are represented by dark shading and low pressure regions (post-working) are represented by light shading. Also, the working path of the fluid (e.g., the path fluid follows to cause rotation of the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is represented by solid arrows and the non-working path of the fluid (e.g., the path fluid follows for cooling, lubrication and/or sealing purposes) is represented by dashed arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the first direction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, high pressure fluid is introduced through the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sequentially directs a primary portion of the high pressure fluid through the first set of flow channels in manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thereby channels the high pressure fluid to the fluid pockets of the gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> orbits/rotates in a first direction (e.g, clockwise). The now-low-pressure (post-working) fluid then flows through the second set of flow channels in the manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the second chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and exits the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the second port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. (See solid arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the first direction, a secondary portion of the high pressure fluid bypasses the working path and travels through the non-working path. Specifically, the secondary portion of the high pressure fluid travels through the axial passageway <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the drive link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the axial passageway <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The rotation of the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> produces centrifugal forces causing the high pressure fluid to be flung through the shaft&apos;s radial passageway <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> into the chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The fluid flows from the chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, through the radial passageways <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> into the chamber <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and back into the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> whereat it mixes with the inlet high pressure fluid being introduced through the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. (See dashed arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the second direction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, high pressure fluid is introduced through the second port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the second chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The commutator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sequentially directs all of the high pressure fluid (i.e., none of the high pressure fluid is diverted from the working path) through the second set of flow channels in the manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thereby channels the high pressure fluid to the fluid pockets of the gerotor set <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thereby causing the rotor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to orbit/rotate in a second opposite direction (e.g., counterclockwise). The now-low-pressure (post-working) fluid then flows through the first set of flow channels in the manifold <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a primary portion of the low pressure fluid exits the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. (See solid arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the second direction, a secondary portion of the low pressure fluid does not exit the motor through the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> but instead travels through the non-working path. Specifically, the secondary portion of the low pressure fluid travels through the drive link&apos;s axial passageway <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, into the shaft&apos;s axial passageway <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, through the shaft&apos;s radial passageway <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, into the chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, through the shaft&apos;s radial passageways <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> into the chamber <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and back into the first chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> whereat it mixes with the low pressure fluid being exited through the first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. (See dashed arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in a first direction, the fluid flows in a first direction through the working path of the fluid circuit and, when the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in a second direction, the fluid flows in a second direction through the working path of the fluid circuit. In either case, a portion of the fluid is centrifugally pumped through the non-working path in the same direction by the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the first direction, the non-working portion of the fluid is diverted from the high pressure (pre-working) fluid and, when the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in the second direction, the non-working portion of the fluid is diverted from the low pressure (post-worked) fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, that the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defines a cylindrical pressure vessel having a diameter D and an axial length L. (The diameter D is defined by the outermost radial reach of the fluid circuit and the axial length is defined by the distance between the outermost axial reach of the fluid circuit.) The working portion of this pressure vessel (i.e., the portion occupied by the working path), has an axial length L<highlight><subscript>working </subscript></highlight>confined to the end cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the drive assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As such, the working fluid avoids the essentially inevitable pressure-dropping resistance it would be subjected to if the fluid traveled through non-working portions of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This confinement of the working path results in a substantially less no-load pressure drop (e.g., 50% less) of the fluid as it travels through the working path than that found in conventional hydraulic motors which translates into a dramatic improvement in motor efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As is best seen by referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the clamping bolts <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are radially positioned outside the diameter D of the motor&apos;s pressure vessel. The bolt-receiving openings do not communicate with any of the motor&apos;s fluid chambers and the face seals <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (which define the diameter D of the pressure vessel) are located radially inward from the bolts <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;dry-bolt&rdquo; design of the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> results in less strain-per-bolt for a motor design having a given number of clamping bolts. Also, because fluid flow characteristics do not play a part in bolt placement considerations, more clamping bolts <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be used in a given motor design thereby additionally or alternatively reducing the strain-per-bolt. As the life of the clamping bolts directly influences the life of the motor, such a strain-per-bolt reduction can make a major contribution towards increasing motor life. Further, the integrity of the clamping bolts during their working life provides consistent performance regardless of whether the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is being operated in the first or second direction. Moreover, from a manufacturing point of view, this &ldquo;dry bolt&rdquo; design avoids the extra manufacturing cost of countersink machining which is necessary in a &ldquo;wet bolt&rdquo; design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, another hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown. The motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is similar in many ways to the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whereby like reference numerals (plus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) are used to designate corresponding parts. It should be noted, however, that the shaft housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a case drain <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> extending from the chamber <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> whereby the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a three pressure zone design. Also, the drive link <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> does not include an axial passageway (although one could be provided). Further, as is best seen by referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the inner commutator ring is replaced with a cap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. The cap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> covers the nose end <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the drive link <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and separates the first chamber <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> from the chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> surrounding the drive link <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, except for passageways <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> extending therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The fluid circuit for the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> when the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is respectively operating in a first direction (e.g. the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise) and in a second direction (e.g., the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> rotates counterclockwise). As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, the high pressure regions are represented by dark shading, the low pressure regions are represented by light shading, the working path is represented by solid arrows and the non-working path is represented by dashed arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The working path for the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is essentially the same as the working path for the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the first direction and the second direction. (See solid arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>.) Also, the working portion of the pressure vessel of the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has an axial length L<highlight><subscript>working </subscript></highlight>confined to the end cover <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the drive assembly <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. As with the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, this confinement of the working portion of the pressure vessel significantly reduces the no-load pressure drop of the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which translates directly into an increased mechanical efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operating in the first direction (the first port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is the inlet port), a secondary portion of the high pressure fluid bypasses the working path and travels through the non-working path. (See dashed arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>.) When the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operating in the second direction (the second port <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is the inlet port), a secondary portion of the low pressure fluid bypasses the working path and travels through the non-working path. (See dashed arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>.) In either case, the non-working fluid travels from the first chamber <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> through a passageway (passageway <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to the chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> surrounding the drive link <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Part of the non-working fluid in the chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> flows through the axial passageway <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> in the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, through the radial passageway <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> to the chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The rest of the working fluid in the chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> flows through the radial passageway <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> in the coupling shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The non-working fluid in the chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> exits the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the case drain <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If the diameter of the pressure vessel for the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is defined by the outermost radial reach of the flow circuit, this would include the case drain <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. However, the clamping bolts <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are positioned outside a pressure vessel defined by the working portion of the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (i.e., D<highlight><subscript>working </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>working</subscript></highlight>). Moreover, the flow circuit of the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> does not intersect with the registered openings for the clamping members <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and thus the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also has a &ldquo;dry bolt&rdquo; design with the same associated advantages as found in motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, another hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown. The motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is similar in many ways to the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> whereby like reference numerals (plus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) are used to designate corresponding parts. It should be noted, however, that in the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the drive link <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is inserted into the gearbox of the mechanism and directly coupled to its input shaft whereby the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> does not have a coupling shaft and/or a shaft housing. Accordingly, the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> does not include the bearings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> found in motors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> whereby the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be considered to be &ldquo;bearingless.&rdquo; A mounting face housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is provided for attachment to the gearbox and this housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes a case drain <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> extending from the chamber <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. Thus, the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has a three-pressure-zone design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The fluid circuit for the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> with the high pressure regions being represented by dark shading, the low pressure regions being represented by light shading, the working path being represented by solid arrows and the non-working path being represented by dashed arrows. Since most gearboxes are not designed to accommodate high pressure lubricating/cooling fluid, the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is appropriate for unidirectional applications wherein high pressure fluid is introduced through the second port <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the high pressure fluid is introduced through the second port <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and travels through the drive assembly <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and back to the first chamber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as low pressure fluid and a primary portion of the low pressure fluid exits the motor through the first port <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. (See solid arrows.) A secondary portion of the low pressure fluid bypasses the working path and travels through the non-working path, that is it travels from the first chamber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> through a passageway (see passageway <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to the chamber <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> to the case drain <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>. (See dashed arrows.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The working portion of the pressure vessel of the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has an axial length L<highlight><subscript>working </subscript></highlight>confined to the end cover <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the drive assembly <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and, as with the motors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, this confinement significantly reduces no-load pressure drops. Also, the clamping bolts <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are positioned outside a pressure vessel defined by the working portion of the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (i.e., D<highlight><subscript>working </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>working</subscript></highlight>) and the motor&apos;s flow circuit does not intersect with the registered openings for the clamping members <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Thus, the motor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> also has a &ldquo;dry bolt&rdquo; design with the same associated advantages as found in motors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> One can now appreciate that a hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can provide decreased no-load pressure losses, an extended life expectancy, an enhanced start-up efficiency, and/or an increased torque capacity. It should be noted that while the illustrated motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was designed for heavy duty applications requiring low speed and high torque, the principals of the invention can be employed in motors designed for other applications. It should also be noted that while the various aspects of the invention have been described as being incorporated into the same motor design, these aspects could be used separately and/or in different combination in a plurality of motor designs. By way of an example, the valve interface sealing arrangement can be used on a fast-speed commutator (as shown), a slow-speed commutator or, for that matter, in a variety of valve interface settings to prevent friction during start-up and/or very low speed operation. By way of another example, the rotor-mounted axial stop system could be utilized in many other motor designs to limit internal mechanical friction upon engagement of the drive link with the axial stop. By way of a further example, a drive link with an axial passageway could be used in certain three-pressure-zone motor designs. Accordingly, although the invention has been shown and described with respect to certain preferred embodiments, it is obvious that equivalent and obvious alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification. </paragraph>
