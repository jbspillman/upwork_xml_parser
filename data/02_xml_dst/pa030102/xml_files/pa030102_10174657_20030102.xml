<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention is based on Dr. Nemtsev&apos;s research and knowledge of lasers in the former Soviet Union. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Laser Therapy is the application of red and near infra-red light, from LEDs or Laser diodes over injuries or lesions to improve wound and soft tissue healing and provide relief to both acute and chronic pain. It improves the overall immune functions. Laser Therapy is officially referred to as &ldquo;Low Level Laser Therapy&rdquo; or LLLT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 2. Problem: Back Ground on Pain Management, Healing, Detoxification, and Immune Function </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The Department of Defense (DoD) is in pursuit of developing novel medical technology that allows the individual soldier to overcome acute battlefield injuries in an austere and isolated environment. Statistics show that relatively minor injuries are responsible for nearly 66% of combat casualties in the battlefield. Nonetheless, even these minor injuries often lead to evacuation, which compromises the unit and can lead to mission failure. Hemorrhage accounts for 40% of deaths in the battlefield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is a tremendous lack in medical devices that allow the individual soldier to stabilize his injury and overcome his immediate need for classical medical care, which would result in a reduction in morbidity and mortality in the battlefield, and an increase in soldier persistence. These devices must have diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities to allow non-medic soldiers to overcome operational combat hazards from conventional munitions, laser weapons, chemical weapons and radiation. Ultimately these technologies must be light enough to carry in a backpack, or incorporated into the soldier&apos;s Battle Dress Uniform (BDU). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Pain is a problem to mankind generally (as well as to soldiers on the battlefield) and everyone responds differently to pain. As pain is highly individualized and subjective, the soldier that is actually experiencing the pain is the only authority on that particular pain. Pain management, though constantly improving, remains suboptimal in some respects due to both inadequacies of health care delivery and in the range of available drugs and devices and other therapeutic modalities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The Wound Healing process is a complex series of events that begins at the moment of injury and can continue for months to years. Stage 1 is the &ldquo;Inflammatory Phase&rdquo;, Stage 2 is the &ldquo;Proliferative Phase&rdquo;, and Stage 3, the &ldquo;Remodeling Phase&rdquo;. Wound contamination and infection poses the highest treat to soldiers on and off the battlefield. A contaminated wound will heal, an infected wound will not. Although all wound exudate contains bacteria killing enzymes that will help prevent an infection, proper cleansing, debridement and maintaining of a moist wound environment on the battlefield is less than optimal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Detoxification: As the threat of both chemical and biological weapon use in the battlefield increases, there is a great need in both protection and treatment. Military chemical agents currently know to exist fall into seven groups. The modern agents are toxins, defoliants, nerve agents, incapacitating agents, and psychological agent, but older substances such as blister and chocking agents are still available on the market. Although most agents are treatable, but unless the individual soldier receives immediate care right there and than on the battlefield, there is little chance of full recovery. A consideration frequently overlooked is that no attempt has been made to supply NBC clothing to the civilian population at large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the civilian as well as the military population, intoxication w/drugs &amp; alcohol as well as hazardous chemical exposure in the home, office or workplace continue to present serious problems health problems.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 3. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There are many laser therapy devices out on the market, being manufactured by companies all over the world. However, most of the device manufacturers are located in Europe and Asia, with little or no market representations in the United States. Medical laser manufacturers in the US are mainly into surgical and cosmetic lasers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Please note: None of the LLLT or LED therapy devices out on the market are wearable or applied with either a permanent or electric magnet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 1. Light Therapy by Laser or LED </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Laser Therapy is the application of red and near infra-red light over injuries or lesions to improve wound and soft tissue healing and give relief for both acute and chronic pain. Laser Therapy is officially referred to as &ldquo;Low Level Laser Therapy&rdquo; or LLLT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Laser Therapy is used to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 1) Increase the speed, quality and tensile strength of tissue repair </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 2) Give pain relief </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 3) Resolve inflammation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 4) An alternative to needles for acupuncture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The red and near infrared light (600 nm-1000 nm) can be produced by laser or high intensity LED. The intensity of LLLT lasers and LED&apos;s is not high like a surgical laser, there is no heating effect. LLLT devices are typically delivering 5 mW-1000 mW (0.2-&gt;0.01 Wafts). The power density typically ranges from 0.05W/Cm2-&gt;5 W/Cm2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> LLLT aims to biostimulate. Because of the low power nature of the LLLT, the effect is photochemical (like photosynthesis in plants) and not thermal and can not cause heating and thereby cause damage to living tissues. Four distinct effects are known to occur when using LLLT (See FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> &amp; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A. Growth factor response within cells and tissue as a result of increased ATP and protein synthesis; Improved cell proliferation; Change in cell membrane permeability to calcium up-take. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> B. Pain relief as a result of increased endorphin release; Increased serotonin; Suppression of nociceptor action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> C. Strengthening the immune system response via increasing levels of lymphocyte activity and through a newly researched mechanism termed photomodulation of blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> D. Acupuncture point stimulation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> 2. Photomodulation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The effects of the photomodulation are associated with the generation of singlet oxygen in blood (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Singlet oxygen dissolved in blood is very unstable and when deactivated, it activates surrounding water dipoles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Water activation near the membrane causes membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization process causes various treatment effects. One of them is cell membrane receptor cleaning from attached polarized toxin groups. If an immune-competent cell is cleaned, a functional activity of different immune receptors improves. This effect is known as priming effect of immune-competent cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A good example of this effect would be when there are toxins present in the blood stream. The polarized toxins tend to attach themselves to the Red Blood Cells (RBC), causing a decrease in its capability to carry oxygen (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) to the vital parts of the body amongst other functions. The photomodulation effects caused by the LLLT will depolarize the RBC and thus cause the toxins and other radicals to repel from it, thereby greatly improving its abilities to function properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> 3. Light Module Parameters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The invention: Light Bracelet and Brace, will utilize the following parameters to achieve the best possible therapeutic effects for: Pain Management, Wound Healing, and Detoxification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A. Selection of the correct beneficial &ldquo;Wavelength&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> B. The use of the correct &ldquo;Power levels&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> C. The consistent application of the necessary amount of &ldquo;Energy&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> D. And different &ldquo;Pulsing Frequency&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A. Wavelength: The invention will utilize both red light and infrared in the following parameters: (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Red Light&equals;620-675 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Infrared&equals;780-1200 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The benefits of &ldquo;Red Light&rdquo; in these wavelengths are: 1) The wavelengths in this spectrum are readily absorbed by the mitochondria and therefore potentially stimulatory; 2) It is an excellent source of stimulation of growth factors; 3) Does not penetrate deep below the skin surface and into the tissue below; 4) Non-thermal, does not cause any burns; 5) Best for wound healing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The benefits of &ldquo;Infrared&rdquo; in these wavelengths are: 1) Absorbed through the cell walls (acting differently between cells) and therefore cell response is more wavelength specific in the infrared range, responding differently to different wavelengths; 2) More penetrative through the tissue, especially the 800 nm range, therefore this range is best for treatment through intact skin and pain relief. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> B. Power: The invention will use the following power strengths in its devices: 10 mW-200 mW (0.2-&gt;0.01 Watts). The power density will range from 0.05W/Cm2-&gt;5 W/Cm2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> C. Energy: The energy level in measured in &ldquo;Jules&rdquo; with the simple formula: Energy&equals;Power&times;Time. The devices of the invention will utilize a special timing circuit that will automatically calculate the energy according the power level and wavelength and adjust the exposure time accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> D. Pulsing Frequency: Our research has shown that there are specific frequencies that are effective in pain management, wound healing, detoxification, and other treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> 4. Magnet Parameters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When a magnetic field is placed against the body, bio-electric activity occurs. What happens at a cellular level is that trace elements of iron and potassium in the blood are drawn to the resulting magnetic field, causing a mild constricting effect in the blood stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Red blood cells are drawn to the affected areas, increasing lymphatic drainage and helping to remove the blockages. This means that damaged tissue can repair which, in turn, allows the inflamed capillaries to dilate. This removes tension from the nerve endings, which cease to be aggravated. The results of the applied magnetic field are: pain relief, plus a restoration of electron flow in the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The strength of the magnet is rated against the earth&apos;s natural magnetic field, which is 0.5 gauss. Both the permanent and electric magnet in the invention will be in the following gauss range:
