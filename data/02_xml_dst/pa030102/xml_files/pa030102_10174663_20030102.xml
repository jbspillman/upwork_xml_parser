<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hobbing cutters, first and foremost, are used for manufacturing toothed components such as gears, worm gears, racks and the like. Generally, a distinction is made between a bore-type design and a shank-type design. In the bore-type design, the bore is provided with a longitudinal groove for a positive torque transmission. As an alternative, the bore may be made with a one-sided or two-sided transverse groove for a positive torque transmission. However, a bore design using front-side frictional transmission is known as well. In the shaft-type design, two-sided shanks are integrally formed with the tool body for a non-positive torque transmission. The shanks may be tapered on the two sides, or tapered on one side and cylindrical on the other side. The conical shanks may be hollow or may also be designed as a steep-angle taper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The material primarily used for such hobbing cutters is high-speed steel. However, it is also known to manufacture hobbing cutter bodies from cemented carbide. Cemented carbide is a term which comprehends materials made by powder metallurgy which substantially consist of the tungsten carbide, titanium carbide, and tantalum carbide materials and cobalt as a binder. Cemented carbides exhibit an increased wear resistance to steel and, therefore, may be used for inserts having a higher cutting speed, i.e. also for dry machining. The temperature limit for cemented carbide insert use is far higher than that of steel, e.g. about 1000&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cemented carbide, however, inherently is of a relative high brittleness. This is why bumps and shocks may rapidly damage the tool the manufacture of which involves exceptional expenditure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is also known to fix a cemented-carbide hollow tool body to a shank made of steel. Fixing is primarily done by soldering. The advantage of this embodiment is that solely the tool portion proper is made of the favourable cemented-carbide material whereas the shank is formed from material involving little expenditure. Further, it is known to provide the tool body of a hobbing cutter with a hard-material coating (e.g. titanium nitrite) in the so-called PVD process. The coating is applied after the tool body is finish-machined on the steel shaft. This is necessary for reasons of accuracy. Coating is performed at relatively high temperatures, e.g. 500&deg; C. Since steel has a distinctly higher coefficient of expansion than has a cemented carbide there is a risk of the tool body being destroyed by the temperature-induced expansion of the steel shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the invention to provide a hobbing cutter the core of which is made of steel and the tool body of which is made of cemented carbide and can be subjected to higher temperatures with the temperature-induced expansion of the steel core not having an adverse effect on the tool body. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the inventive design of a hobbing cutter, the steel basic body is formed as an equilateral polygon in cross-section, e.g. as a hexagon or octagon. Cemented-carbide segments having the length of a polygon side, which include one or more cutting edges, are mounted on the basic body in such a way that they form a tool unit together. The segments may be soldered to the basic body or may be joined thereto in a positive fit with the sides of the basic body, according to an aspect of the invention, each having defined an axially parallel groove therein which is engaged by a ledge-shaped protrusion, for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The process for manufacturing the inventive hobbing cutter provides that cemented-carbide segments having an incomplete or pre-profiled contour are mounted on a steel basic body which is formed as an equilateral polygon in cross-section. The tool unit is finish-machined subsequently. The segments may be formed from sintered metal with no profile before being mounted on the basic body. As an alternative, they may first be pre-profiled by sintering and be mounted on the basic body afterwards. The profile will then only be finish-ground once they are on the basic body.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While this invention may be embodied in many different forms, there are described in detail herein a specific preferred embodiment of the invention. This description is an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiment illustrared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> hobbing cutter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in a cross-section. It is comprised of a basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and individual cutting edge segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is illustrated in a side view and a section along lines A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is an equilateral hexagon in cross-section. One end of the portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has formed thereto a clamping taper and the other end has formed thereto a cylindrical gudgeon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which exhibits a portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is provided with opposed flattened areas as is shown in the A-A section. The configuration of the gudgeons <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is conventional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> manufactured from steel has axially parallel grooves <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are of a rectangular shape in cross-section, at the sides in the central portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The cutting edge segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> six of which are joined to the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed from an appropriate cemented carbide. Each segment has three milling teeth <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> between which grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are disposed. The configuration of the teeth <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is conventional. On the side facing the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided with a surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the length of which corresponds to one side each of a surface of the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For instance, the length of the segments corresponds to the length of the basic body portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, the length may be smaller so that two or more segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are successively disposed in an axially parallel direction. Expansion joints <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are provided between the segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and even if the segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are axially disposed side by side an expansion joint requires to be provided between them in order to compensate the different expansion of the material of the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, on one hand, and the segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, on the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Centrally extending from the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cutting edge segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a ledge-shaped protrusion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is adapted to be fittingly inserted into a groove <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For the manufacture of the segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, pre-formed segments are initially manufactured from cemented carbide, e.g. by using a sintering method as is outlined by the bold continuous line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. These segments are mounted on the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and fixed by soldering, for instance. This is followed by forming the milling teeth <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is also imaginable to pre-profile the segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and to finish-machine them subsequently, e.g. by grinding, after mounting them on the basic body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The above Examples and disclosure are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. These examples and description will suggest many variations and alternatives to one of ordinary skill in this art. All these alternatives and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the attached claims. Those familiar with the art may recognize other equivalents to the specific embodiments described herein which equivalents are also intended to be encompassed by the claims attached hereto. </paragraph>
