<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">It is possible for the content distribution side to control the conditions of target viewers for distributions without depending on the functions specific to a receiver. Content which is broadcast, a content profile, and a program are received. In an initial step of the program, prestored viewer profile information is read. All the content profiles and the contents are downloaded temporarily. Next, the profile information is read, and then a process of matching the profile information with the viewer profile information is performed. When it is determined that they do not match, a matching process for the next content profile is performed. If, on the other hand, they match, at the next step, the content is stored. The viewer reproduces the stored content at an appropriate time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a receiving apparatus and method, an information distribution method, a filtering and storing program, and a recording medium, which can be applied to, for example, a cumulative-receiving-type digital broadcasting system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, among methods which have already been put into practical use in broadcast media, a method of filtering content which is distributed according to attributes and preferences of a viewer in order to store only the content which matches those of the viewer does not exist. As a method which has been used in practice, there is a method in which genre information is added to program information for an EPG (Electronic Program Guide), the program information is filtered according to the genre information preferred by the viewer, and recommended programs are then provided to the viewer. However, since such a method is not a method of filtering the content itself, some work is necessary for the viewer to select a desired program from a displayed list of recommended programs. Furthermore, for a broadcaster such as a broadcasting station, the probability that a target viewer watches the content which is provided becomes low. In addition, since the content is in program units, there is another problem in that filtering in units of data content, which is a subdivision unit, cannot be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, the specification of a new broadcasting system, in which a storage device such as a hard disk is provided, content is acquired from a broadcast, the Internet, etc., the content is stored in a storage device, and a viewer watches a desired program at a desired time, is being formulated by the &ldquo;TV Anytime Forum&rdquo;, which is a standardization organization. In the &ldquo;TV Anytime&rdquo; specification, a model of filtering and storing in content units is assumed. Here, a model is assumed in which attribute information, such as the genre of the content, is transmitted as meta data, and on the receiving side, content which matches a user profile is filtered by a process of matching a set user profile with the attribute information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The algorithm of the filtering proposed earlier depends strictly on the functionality at the receiver side. In other words, since filtering is specific to the receiver maker, it is considered to be difficult to manage for a broadcaster which desires that filtering be widely performed in the unified manner for assumed target viewers. For example, in a case where direct mail is to be distributed by a broadcast, there is a problem in that it is not possible to distribute direct mail to a sufficient number of persons. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as a method of filtering based on a viewer profile, a method has been proposed in which meta data of attribute information, such as a genre, is added to the content and then transmitted, and in which desired content is filtered based on the function set by individual receivers. In comparison with this method, the method nf the present invention has the advantage of being capable of being widely used in receivers having a basic function without depending on the receiver, and furthermore, the advantage of being capable of controlling the condition of viewers to whom content is desired to be distributed in a unified manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention makes it possible to make the distribution of information content by a broadcast and the distribution of information content by Internet access coexist or to be used in different ways, yielding the advantage that more efficient management can be performed.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The embodiment can be applied to a case in which direct mail, flyers, etc., which are converted into electronic form and then converted into multimedia, are distributed to target viewers. Various information providers set the attributes of customers who, the providers think, desire to receive the information which the providers want to transmit. The information providers broadcast the information through a broadcasting station and cause the information to be stored in a storage device of a receiver of a targeted customer by means of a particular scheme. For the customer, information appropriate for one&apos;s preferences and requirements is stored in the customer&apos;s receiver without the customer taking any particular action. The customer is informed of the fact that the information is stored, and reproduces and browses this information. The information such that the viewer has browsed specific information is counted up in a customer management/transaction center on the communication network through an uplink, and the information is fed back to the information provider. The platform dealer managing this scheme charges each information provider according to the number of times each customer browses, and can obtain an income. In the following description, , for the sake of convenience, such broadcasting services according to the present invention will be referred to as &ldquo;d-mail services&rdquo; (meaning direct-mail services). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the overall system of an embodiment of the present invention. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes an information provider. The information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is, for example, a direct mail forwarder. The information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> passes to a broadcaster <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the information of the content which is desired to be distributed. The broadcaster <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> distributes programs via a broadcast or communication satellite <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a receiver, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> denotes a viewer of broadcast services. The receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a storage device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such as a hard disk, so that filtered content can be stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The flow of processes over time on the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be described. In the initial process, in order to receive the provision of the d-mail service, the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the broadcasting services accesses, for example, a Web site (viewer registration site) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> dedicated to the relevant service on the Internet through an uplink (communication line) from the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and performs viewer registration and inputs viewer profile (preference) information. The program for inputting the viewer program information is provided to the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> who has performed viewer registration and inputting of a viewer profile is treated as having concluded a contract for receiving d-mail services. The cost required for the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to receive the provision of the d-mail services is free or is set at a relatively low price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When viewer information is to be input, access is made to a commonly called BML (Broadcast Markup Language) document by a multimedia coding method called, for example, BML, in accordance with the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) protocol. In the BML browser function of this receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, by executing a BML document, the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is requested to input registration information to be set and profile information. As a result of completing the input of these pieces of information, a customer ID is assigned, and the customer ID and the profile information are stored as viewer profile information in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, these are sent to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, where they are managed. Furthermore, the viewer can set a receiving reservation (reservation at the receiving date and time, the channel to be received, etc.), by which data, such as content distributed by the d-mail service, is stored in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> However, it is also possible to transmit data necessary for d-mail service through a channel on which a normal television program is broadcast rather than through a channel dedicated to the d-mail service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the second process, the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> creates, as multimedia content, information which is desired to be sent to a viewer group having specific attributes. In Japan, for example, a BML document content is created. For example, a pizza advertisement flyer is created in a form in which an order can be placed. At the same time, the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets profile condition information (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;content profile&rdquo; as necessary) represented by a conditional equation based on the above-described viewer profile information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this case, the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can access the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and can determine the approximate total number of viewers matching the set profile conditions from the viewer profile database within a server at the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This makes it possible for the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to check whether or not effects commensurate with the effort spent to originate information can be obtained. As a result, it is possible for the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to adjust the content profile so that an appropriate number of target viewers is reached. That is, when the number of viewers is too small, since there is a risk that the advertisement effects become small, the viewers is too large, since the cost becomes high, the content profile is made more strict. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the third process, the broadcaster <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives information content and a content profile from a plurality of information providers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in order to manage daily services. The broadcaster <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> assigns, for each content, a content ID for management. Furthermore, a filtering and storing program for causing a filtering and storing operation to be performed in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed as a script file, and a schedule is created so that the script file can be broadcast together with the information content and the content profile. The script file is created as a BML document. Basically, this script file containing the same contents can be used. The content, the content profile, and the script file for the filtering and storing program are broadcast as a packet stream by a repeated transmission method called a &ldquo;data carousel&rdquo;. Broadcasting management is broadly classified into two management methods: linked-type management and independent-type management, which will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the fourth process, the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives the above-described group of files of the broadcast data carousel. The flow of this receiving process is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives, as d-mail service filtering and storing program (filtering and storing execution script) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The content profile <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the content <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are associated with each other by a content ID, and the same number of files is contained. The filtering and storing execution script <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is one file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The processing inside the receiver will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Initially, when the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives the above-described data, first, the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> accesses the filtering and storing execution script <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that this file is activated. In order that the filtering and storing execution script <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is performed first, a specific packet number is assigned to the script file <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In the execution of the script, in the initial step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, viewer profile information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is stored as a file in a nonvolatile memory or a hard disk within the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, all the content profiles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the contents <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are temporarily downloaded into the cache area of the receiver (step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Then, the profile information (viewer profile condition information) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for the first content is read (step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). In step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a process of matching the read profile information with the viewer profile information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not they match. When they do not match, the process returns to the reading of the next content profile in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a matching process for the second content profile is performed. If they match in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the corresponding content <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is stored in a directory in the storage device indicated by the script. In this case, as a result of placing title information, with which the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> makes a list display later, in the content profile, the titles are also stored. Furthermore, the content IDs are also stored. For the second and subsequent contents, the processes from steps S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are performed for all the information contents which are transmitted at the same time, and only the matched content is stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the fifth process, the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> operates the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at an appropriate time in order to display the title list of the contents stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the title of the content that he/she wants to reproduce is specified. The content of the specified title is read from the storage device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is reproduced, and is displayed on the display device of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The content ID and the browsing data and time corresponding to the reproduced content are written in a log information area of the nonvolatile memory or the hard disk of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The above-described series of processes are possible for both the case where these processes are executed as a resident application in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the case where these processes are executed by a BML document transmitted by the d-mail service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the sixth process, the content viewing log information stored in the nonvolatile memory or the hard disk of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is collectively uploaded automatically to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> together with the customer ID by using an uplink at an appropriate time. This uploading process is possible for both the case where this process is executed by a resident application in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the case where this process is executed by a BML document transmitted by the d-mail service. It is preferable that content viewing log information be controlled so as to be sent at an appropriate uploading interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In an environment in which the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is always connected to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the method is not limited to a method of collectively transmitting the content viewing log, but a method of transmitting the viewing log to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> when the viewer browses may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the seventh process, the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> receives viewing log information for each viewer, uploaded from the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and basically counts, for each content ID, the total number of viewers who browsed in a predetermined period of time. The number of viewers who browsed for each content can be viewed from the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> if desired. Based on this number of viewers who browsed each content, automatic linking to a system which performs a settlement process for the platform dealer (a dealer who performs operations and management of d-mail services) is also possible. On the other hand, when the customer ID is contained in the viewing log information, by counting up and analyzing the content profile by which the content is viewed for each customer, personal information regarding the requirements of each viewer can be accumulated, making it possible to perform careful customer handling services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an example of a method of matching viewer profile information with a content profile is described. In the initial step, when viewer profile information is to be input, as an example, an input screen, such as that indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, is used. The viewer profile is composed of a basic profile containing a set of basic viewer attributes such as addresses and ages, and several extension profiles indicating, hobbies, preferences, etc. For each of the basic profile and the extension profile, there are <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> selective input items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The extension profile includes profiles for each field, such as music, sports, etc., and these are identified by a profile-ID. The basic profile is indicated by profile-ID&equals;0, and the extension profile is indicated by profile-ID&gE;for each field. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> music profile of profile-ID&equals;1 is shown. The extension profile is set as necessary. For example, for a user interested only in music, it is also possible to manage setting only the extension profile of the music field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an example is shown in which, as a viewer profile, only the basic profile and the music profile are set. An input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for the user (the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), as an example, forms one screen for each of the basic profile and the music profile. In this matching method, it is necessary for the user to input &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; for all the items. As an example, the circled items within the input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> represent selected ones (Yes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The inputting on this input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is performed in the above-described first process. For example, access is made to a specific Web site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the Internet, and then access is made to a specific BML document therein. The BML browser of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> displays the input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the screen of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> performs an input operation by using a remote-control commander, etc., in order to input an item. The viewer profile input by the viewer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is stored as a file in the nonvolatile memory or the hard disk of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the matching method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, by mapping each item set to &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo;, using &ldquo;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, to each bit which is assigned in a corresponding manner, the items can be stored as a bit map compressed to the minimum amount of information, as indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. 16 bits (2 bytes) in the upper row of a viewer profile bit map <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> correspond to the set items of the basic profile of the input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and 16 bits (2 bytes) in the lower row thereof correspond to the set items of the music profile as an extension profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The setting &ldquo;01010 . . . &rdquo; is made from the lowest-order bit (the rightmost bit) of the bit map corresponding to the basic profile to the high-order side. The lowest-order bit corresponds to the &ldquo;sex&rdquo; of &ldquo;male&rdquo; of the basic profile within the input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The second lowest bit corresponds to &ldquo;female&rdquo; thereof. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, since &ldquo;female&rdquo; is selected, these two bits are set to &ldquo;01&rdquo;. Hereafter, in accordance with the setting of each item, each bit is set to &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo;. For the music profile, also in a similar manner, a viewer profile bit map is formed. For the viewer profile bit map of a total of 4 bytes, bit numbers <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are assigned in sequence starting from the lowest-order bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Next, the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which has produced specific information content sets the profile of a target viewer to whom the content is desired to be sent as a content profile in the second process in the description of the above-described flow of information over time. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> denotes an example of a content profile set with respect to a particular content. That is, a &ldquo;viewer who is a 20-year-old woman or younger, likes Japanese pop and Karaoke, or a viewer who likes &ldquo;Morning Girls&rdquo;&rdquo; is set as a content profile <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In this case, the information provider sets, in a content profile input system, the profile condition of the target viewer in accordance with an AND/OR condition in an input screen similar to the viewer profile input screen <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In this content profile input system, the input content profile is created as an AND/OR condition of each item of the viewer profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this example, as indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the content profile data is created as data in the form of a table such that, as a viewer profile condition, the bit number of each item constituting the AND condition is expanded in the row direction, and the OR condition is expanded in the column direction. The broadcaster <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receiving the content and the content profile data distributes the content, the content profile data, and the filtering and storing execution program in the third process in the description of the above-described flow of information over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, in the fourth process of the description of the above-described flow of information over time, a filtering and storing execution program is activated in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the viewer profile data stored in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is read (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Next, content profile data <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is received and extracted (steps S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). At this time, for the content profile data, the AND conditional equation portion is developed from the transmission format <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in a table form into bit map data similar to the viewer profile data, as indicated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, as a matching process in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, bit computation of the viewer profile bit map <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the content profile data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is performed. That is, only the bits which are set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the bit map data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>portion corresponding to the AND conditional equation within the viewer profile bit map <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are picked up. Then, the AND of the bits which are set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the picked-up bits is computed. When the output of the AND of all the bits is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, it is determined that the content profile and the viewer profile match, and the determination output is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. If the AND output of any one of the bits is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, it is determined that they do not match, and the determination output is set to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition, such a matching process is performed for each of the bit maps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>corresponding to the AND conditional equation so that the OR of the respective matching results is computed to obtain a final matching output. That is, when at least one of the bit maps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>matches the viewer profile bit map <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the matching result is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. On the other hand, if they do not match, the result &ldquo;0&rdquo; is obtained. Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a process of performing the determination of such a matching. When they match, in step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the corresponding content is received and is stored as a file in the hard disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, a description is given of a more detailed management mode and management method for the d-mail service according to the present invention. The outline of the flow of management as a business model, and a base example of a method of matching a content profile with a viewer profile, are as stated above, and are common to several management methods described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Management modes include a linked-type mode in which the d-mail service is provided at the same time as when a television broadcast program is presented, and an independent-type mode which is independent of a television broadcast program. Furthermore, in these management modes, several modifications of the management methods are possible. The management modes/management method will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> First, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the outline of a linked-type management mode is described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the transition of a television screen of a viewer. As an example, the viewer inputs a viewer profile such as that indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and this viewer profile <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is recorded as a file in the storage device of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As an example, profile information <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> indicating &ldquo;age: <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, sex: male, sports: soccer, favorite team: Fighters&rdquo; is set. The profile information regarding sports is set in the extension profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that, as a normal television broadcast, for example, a soccer game is being broadcast. As shown on the television screen indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as in an ordinary case, a broadcast program is being presented to the viewer. In this case, concurrently with the provision of the program by an AV (Audio Visual) stream, the above-described process of the fourth step (a filtering-reception and storing process of a plurality of contents, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is being performed by the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When content which has matched the viewer profile <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and which has been stored exists, after the filtering and storing execution program <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> completes all the storing processes, the filtering and storing execution program <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> causes the fact that information content appropriate for the viewer has arrived and has been stored to be presented and reported, as a message, to the viewer in such a manner as to overlap the message on the screen, as shown on the television screen indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, when the viewer views the message and performs an operation, the filtering and storing execution program <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> displays the titles of the stored contents in sequence on the basis of a timer process, as shown on the television screen indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Here, when the viewer performs a predetermined operation by a commander of a remote controller while a particular title is being displayed, the content is read and displayed, as shown on a television screen <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. For example, in a case where the title of the ticket information of one&apos;s favorite team of soccer is being broadcast, when a specific button operation is performed by using the commander of a remote controller, the screen changes from the screen <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the screen <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and detailed information is presented. On the screen <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a list of games and a reserve button are displayed, so that a ticket of a desired game can be reserved by a predetermined button operation of the commander. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Such a linked type is suitable mainly for the distribution of information content of a genre associated with a program. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an example of game information of the viewer&apos;s favorite team and content for which ticket reservation is possible. When the viewer does not want to interrupt the viewing of the original television program, the viewer may also memorize the arrival of such information content, so that, later, storage navigation software provided in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be executed, and the content can be executed and browsed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a transmission signal and processes in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> over time in the linked-type management. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> denotes a broadcast signal. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> denotes processing within the receiver. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> denotes a file within the storage device. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> denotes an Internet access transaction. Furthermore, the passage of time is shown from the left to the right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Initially, access is made to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the Internet from the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The transaction is indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The content for viewer registration is executed within the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and as a result of inputting by the viewer, a viewer profile is set (receiver process <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). Then, the set viewer profile is sent to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the viewer profile is recorded as a viewer profile file <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the storage device. Furthermore, a script for reproducing the stored content and uploading a viewing log is downloaded from the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is stored as a file in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, in a particular television program <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, a plurality of contents of d-mail services are repeatedly transmitted in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> by a data carousel method. It is common that this point in time is much later than the time when the above-described receiver process <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is performed. In the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as a result of executing the filtering and storing execution script received from this data carousel, in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, only the contents filtered by a matching process from the plurality of contents are stored as files <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in the storage device. The circular marks in the figure conceptually show one file. In the manner described above, the presence of the stored contents is reported to the viewer in the form of a message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, during a television program, the transmission of data carousels is switched so that different content sets are transmitted in time slots indicated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Other filtering and storing scripts are executed in time slots indicated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the contents filtered at each time slot are stored as one file <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and as two files <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in the storage device, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the viewer reads and executes the script <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for a reproduction and for uploading a viewing log at a desired time (a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>), such as the day after the program was viewed, so that the viewer selects a desired content from the stored contents and views it. Furthermore, for the viewed content, as indicated by the transaction <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, the ID information of the content is transmitted as a viewing log to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The reason why reproduction and logging are performed at the same time is that an environment is possible in which always-on connections to the Internet can be made. When otherwise, the reproduction log is collectively sent periodically as once every month. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the outline of an independent-type management mode is described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows transitions of a television screen of a viewer. As an example, the viewer has input a viewer profile such as that indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and this profile information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is recorded as a file in the storage device of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, profile information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> indicating &ldquo;age: <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, sex: male, desired information: stock market information&rdquo; is set. In the case of the independent type mode, information content which is being broadcast is automatically received in a time slot such as at night without the viewer being aware, and filtering causes only information content matching the profile of the viewer to be stored in the storage device. Thereafter, it is possible for the viewer to browse the stored information content appropriate for the viewer at a desired time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> denotes a main menu screen. On the main menu screen <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the receiver, the viewer selects d-mail, which is a service according to the present invention, at a desired time. This shifts to a menu screen <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for d-mail, and the browsing of the information content which has arrived for the viewer is selected within the menu screen <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. It is shown that content of the d-mail service has been stored for the other family members other than the viewer himself/herself. As a result of the selection operation, a screen <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of a list of information contents which have arrived for the viewer and has been stored is displayed. On the screen <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a list of the titles of the information contents is shown, and it is possible for the viewer to browse information content <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> selected from the list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As a method of realizing the above-described independent type, two methods are possible. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a transmission signal and a receiver process over time in one of the methods. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> denotes a broadcast signal.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Initially, access is made to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The transaction is indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The content for viewer registration is executed within the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and as a result of inputting by the viewer, a viewer profile is set (receiver process <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>). Then, the set viewer profile is sent to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the viewer profile is recorded as a viewer profile file <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> in the storage device. Furthermore, a script for reproducing the stored content and uploading a viewing log is downloaded from the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is stored as a file in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the viewer makes a contract for automatic reception of the d-mail service at the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Programs of d-mail service have been set as the same series, and by performing a viewing reservation process of the series of d-mails, it becomes possible to receive the d-mail service, for example, in a time slot late at night every day, for example, 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. As a result, a series of registration processes allows periodic automatic reception of the d-mail service to be performed automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a broadcasting station repeatedly transmits a plurality of contents in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> by a data carousel method. The receiver performs automatic reception by the above-described viewing reservation function. As a result of executing a filtering and storing execution script received from the data carousel transmitted at the time slot <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, only the content filtered from a plurality of contents by a matching process is stored as a file <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the storage in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this example, during the d-mail program, management is performed in such a way that the transmission of the data carousel is switched so as to transmit another content set in time slots indicated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. In time slots indicated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, different filtering and storing scripts are executed, and the filtered content at the respective time slots is stored as files <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the viewer reads and executes the script for reproducing the stored content and uploading a viewing log at a desired time, so that the viewer selects and views a desired content from the stored contents in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, for the viewed content, as indicated by a transaction <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the ID information of the content is transmitted as a viewing log to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Reference numeral <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> denotes an Internet access transaction. Furthermore, the passage of time is shown from the left to the right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Initially, access is made to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The transaction is indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The content for viewer registration is executed within the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and as a result of inputting by the viewer, a viewer profile is set (receiver process <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). Then, the set viewer profile is sent to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the viewer profile is recorded as a viewer profile file <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in the storage device. Furthermore, a script for reproducing the stored content and uploading a viewing log is downloaded from the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is stored as a file in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the viewer makes a contract of automatic reception of the d-mail service at the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Programs of the d-mail service are set as the same series, and by performing a viewing reservation process of the series of d-mail, it becomes possible to receive and store the d-mail service, for example, in a time slot late at night every day, for example, 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. As a result, periodic automatic reception and automatic storage of d-mail service are performed automatically by a series of registration processes. Whereas in the above-described method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> viewing reservation process is performed and the filtered content is stored, in the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> storing reservation process for storing all the received contents of the d-mail service is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a broadcasting station repeatedly transmits a plurality of contents in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> by a data carousel method. The receiver performs automatic reception and automatic storage by the above-described viewing reservation function, as indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. As a result, a script file for filtering/restoring and all the information contents <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which are broadcast are temporarily stored in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the viewer is going to browse content, a script file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for filtering/restoring is executed for a group of a plurality of contents <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, on the main menu screen <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when d-mail is selected, the script file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for filtering/restoring is executed. A process (a filtering/restoring process <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) of filtering content by the viewer profile <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and restoring only content which have passed through a filter and of deleting content which have not passed through a filter is performed. At this point in time, as on the menu screen <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) for d-mail, only information content matching the viewer profile <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is displayed in a list, and the viewer selects the information content therein, so that the selected information content is reproduced (a reproduction and logging process). Furthermore, for the viewed (executed) content, the ID information of the content is transmitted as a transaction <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition, another embodiment of the present invention will be described. The other embodiment is such that, as a result of filtering, after URL (Uniform Resource Locator) information indicating the location of the corresponding information content on the Internet is obtained, access is made to that location, so that the target information content is obtained and stored. For the other embodiment, management of both the linked type and the independent type of the above-described embodiment is possible. When it is desired to realize saving of the broadcasting bandwidth and to distribute much more information content, the other embodiment can be applied effectively to a case in which the viewer profile condition is very rare. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an operation sequence of a filtering and storing execution program <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the other embodiment in which Internet-linked management is performed. The receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives a content profile <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a script file (filtering and storing execution script) <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The content profile <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes profile information for each content and a URL for each content. Since the content itself does not need to be transmitted as broadcast waves, broadcast waves resources do not need be used. However, the other embodiment can be suitably applied to an environment in which always-on connections to the Internet are made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The filtering and storing execution script file <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is formed similarly to the script file <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which is described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. That is, in the initial step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the viewer profile information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> stored as a file in the nonvolatile memory or the hard disk within the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is read. Next, all the content profiles <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are temporarily downloaded into the cache area of the receiver (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Then, the profile information <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the content is read (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), and in step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a process of matching the profile information <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> with the viewer profile information <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is performed. In step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not they match. When they do not match, the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and when they match, the process proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when they match, content is stored. In the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the URL of a single or a plurality of d-mail contents on the Internet, described in association with content profile data, is obtained. Then, access is made to the obtained URL in sequence, and the corresponding d-mail content <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> on the Internet is downloaded and stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a transmission signal and processes over time in the other embodiment of the present invention, for example, in a linked-type management example. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> denotes a broadcast signal. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> denotes processing within the receiver. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> denotes a file within the storage device. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> denotes an Internet access transaction. Furthermore, the passage of time is shown from the left to the right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Initially, access is made to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the Internet from the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The transaction is indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The content for viewer registration is executed within the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and as a result of inputting by the viewer, a viewer profile is set (receiver process <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>). Then, the set viewer profile is sent to the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the viewer profile is recorded as a viewer profile file <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> in the storage device. Furthermore, a script for reproducing the stored content and uploading a viewing log is downloaded from the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is stored as a file in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, in a particular television program <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, content having a plurality of pieces of URL information is repeatedly transmitted in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> by a data carousel method. In the receiver, as a result of executing the filtering and storing execution script received from this data carousel, in a time slot indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, only the URL list filtered by a matching process from the URL list information corresponding to the plurality of contents on the Internet is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In addition, as indicated by the transaction <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, access is made to the stored URLs in sequence, and the obtained information content <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is stored in sequence in the storage device. Thereafter, at a desired time, for example, in a time slot <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, the viewer reads and executes the script file for reproducing the stored content and uploading a viewing log, so that the viewer selects the desired content from the stored content, and the selected information content is reproduced. Furthermore, for the viewed (executed) content, the ID information of the content is transmitted as a transaction <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiment of this invention described above, and various modifications and applications are possible within the spirit and scope of this invention. For example, the timing at which the content of the stored d-mail service is reproduced and the logging timing may be the same or may be different. Furthermore, although the filtering and storing execution script of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> accesses a URL on the Internet when they match, all the matched contents (URLs) may be temporarily stored, and access may be made to the stored URLs in sequence in order to download the content. In addition, in addition to satellite broadcasts, broadcast networks such as digital terrestrial broadcasts and CATV, can be used. Furthermore, the information provider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the broadcaster <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be the same. In a similar manner, the viewer registration site <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the customer management/transaction center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be the same. </paragraph>
