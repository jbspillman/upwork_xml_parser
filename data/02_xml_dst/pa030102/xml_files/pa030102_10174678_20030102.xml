<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a printed end product, in particular, journals, brochures or books, produced of one printed product or of several printed products, collected astraddle and sequentially supplied, and bound by stitching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such methods are performed with so-called gather stitchers as described, for example, in &ldquo;Industrielle Buchbinderei&rdquo; (Industrial Book Binding), verlag Beruf&plus;Schule, 1997, pp. 176-186. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The different printed products are supplied by several feeders, which are arranged along a collecting path, on parallel supply sections to a collecting device arranged upstream of the stitching apparatus. These gather stitchers receive the printed products from stacks or other storage devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For an economical processing of printed products with gathers stitchers, a high number of printed end products is necessary, i.e., the required number of printed end products determines the method to be employed. For example, currently, the general rule is still applied that up to a number of 2000 prints of the same printed end product a digital printing method is more economical in comparison to offset printing because this requires significantly shorter set-up times and, for a corresponding number of prints, an average processing time of approximately eight hours. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to achieve in connection with a method of the aforementioned kind an optimal economic efficiency for a small number of prints in comparison to other successful manufacturing methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved in that the printed products, in the sequence predetermined for forming the printed end product, are collected via a common conveying path and are then stitched. This means that the processing of the printed products is continuously carried out up to the point of collecting and is carried out subsequently in a stepwise manner during the time in which the printed products are collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For achieving a substantially continuous supply of the sequence of the printed products determined for forming a printed end product, they are printed advantageously in a digital printing device and subsequently, during collection of the printed product for the next printed end product, are stitched. Preferably, collecting and stitching are performed at locations spaced from one another along the conveying path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For performing the method, a device is provided according to the invention which is comprised of a feeding device comprising an opening device, transferring the printed products on the conveying path in a spread-apart arrangement onto a conveying-active collecting device with a collecting support, wherein the collecting support, arranged below the opening device so as to be rotatable about an axis of rotation arranged transversely to the feeding direction of the printed products, is driven in a stepwise fashion on a section of the conveying path defined between a collecting location of the supplied printed products and a stitching location. In this way, a compact and simple configuration of the device can be obtained. Moreover, with the device according to the invention it is possible to process printed products produced by an off-line method to stitched printed end products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, several collecting supports are provided and arranged about the axis of rotation so that they have to travel shorter travel distances and can be driven with an acceptable speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the section of the conveying path between the collecting location and the stitching location can be formed by at least one traction means circulating about a deflection drum of a traction mechanism on which collecting supports are fastened at regular spacings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It was found to be expedient when the stitching location and one collecting support form a stitching device; this is beneficial in regard to a simple and compact configuration of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this connection it is advantageous when the stitching location comprises a stitching device comprised of a deforming device for deforming a wire section into a staple and a drive device driving and pushing the deformed wire section as well as a bending device provided on the collecting support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Instead of performing an inaccurate drop of the printed end products, the end of the conveying path at the downstream side is formed as a delivery located downstream of the stitching location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the delivery opens into a conveying arrangement which ensures the further transport of the printed end products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The delivery can be expediently a lifting device which removes the printed end products from the collecting support for which purpose, for example, a knife acting in a controlled fashion on the inner folded edge of the printed end product is particularly suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to be able to provide the printed end product online with a cover, it is expedient when the collecting location has a cover folder feeder correlated therewith with which the cover to be folded is placed from the side onto the printed products resting loosely on the collecting support. Cover folder feeders or the like are described, inter alia, in the aforementioned book &ldquo;Industrielle Buchbinderei&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When using at least one traction means for forming the conveying path, a cover folder feeder can be arranged between the feeding device for the printed products and the stitching path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The conveying end of the feeding device can preferably be formed by an opening device of a printed sheet feeder or by a cycled transporting device. Both types are known; the latter, inter alia, from European patent application 0 095 603 A1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In order for the printed end product to be produced to have the desired number of printed products, the device is connected to a computer-controlled device for performing the inventive method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows schematically a device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for producing a printed end product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for example, journals, brochures or books, comprised of several printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supplied in a certain sequence and stitched by wire. The printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be processed are preferably supplied from a digital printing machine (not illustrated) in the direction F in an imbricated flow, or individually, to a magazine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The employed feeding means for this purpose are known and are therefore not described in this context. The magazine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is part of a printed sheet feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is comprised of a conveying drum <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> removing the printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the magazine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and an opening device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is comprised of two opening drums <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Printed sheet feeders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of this kind are known in the field of gather stitchers and form in the present case the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, an embodiment as disclosed and described in European patent application 0 095 603 A1 could be used as the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows how a printed product <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> spread apart by the opening device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> leaves the printed sheet feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the next printed product is transported by the conveying drum <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into the engaging area of the opening device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The supply section on the conveying path of the printed product <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ends initially on a collecting location <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is defined by a collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the collecting device. The collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a radially projecting stay of a circulating rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which has several collecting supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> distributed about its circumference. The collecting supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have at their free ends a saddle-shaped area on which the printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are placed astraddle. The rotational direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is indicated by the arrow F. The rotational movement of the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is carried out stepwise at a spacing correlated with that of the collecting supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After collection of the number of printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> required for the printed end product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is moved on the conveying path one step farther and reaches a stitching location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The stitching location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is characterized by a stationarily arranged deforming device for deforming a wire section into a U-shaped profile and by a drive device cooperating therewith for driving or pushing the U-shaped wire section through the fold of the printed end product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed of at least one printed product <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprised of several sheets. Both devices are not illustrated in the drawing, but they are well known in connection with gather stitchers. Together with the collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is formed at its free end as a deforming device, a stitching device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> results which is adjustable with respect to the stitching spacing. The principle of the stitching process which is carried out during the time period during which on the trailing collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the next printed end product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are collected is known in general and described, inter alia, in the aforementioned book &ldquo;Industrielle Buchbinderei&rdquo;. As shown in the illustration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> rotates by 45&deg; in the counterclockwise direction so that the collected printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reach the stitching location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the conveying path. Between the collecting location <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the stitching location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a step-wise rotational movement of the collecting supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is carried out which is generated as a result of the time period required for collecting the printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to form a complete printed end product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> After stitching, according to a further method step the removal of the printed products <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is carried out. For example, a telescoping knife or the like, configured to be extended with its free end, can be used for this purpose, which knife or the like acts on the inner folded edge of the printed end product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and transfers it onto a transport means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The transport means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is comprised of a circulating pair of conveying belts forming a conveying channel which transfers the printed end products <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> onto an adjoining conveying device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the same type. In supplementing the above, it should be noted that the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on which the described device components are fastened. On the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> one of two reels <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the wire required for the wire sections can be seen. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the details described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with the exception of the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, can be seen in a perspective illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the printed sheet feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> as the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the circulating collecting supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged downstream. Laterally displaced, in the foreground, a cover folder feeder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to the frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which places a folded cover <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> onto the collected printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> before the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is moved one method step farther for stitching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention is illustrated. It has, in contrast to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>, a traction mechanisms, comprised of two parallel circulating traction means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and driven in a stepwise fashion, instead of the rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The traction means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are connected to one another by stay-shaped collecting supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending transversely to the conveying direction Q. Along the upper conveying run formed by the traction means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the form of a printed sheet feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is arranged at the upstream end. In order to provide a space-saving arrangement, the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is arranged on a frame <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> above a deflection drum <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> forming the end of the traction mechanism, the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being placed onto the frame <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has downstream thereof along the upper conveying run a cover feeder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in front of the stitching location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with which the folded covers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as in the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are placed onto the collected printed products <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a spread-apart arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Of course, in an embodiment as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, by eliminating the cover feeder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> between the feeding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the stitching location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> instead a cover folder feeder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&mdash;as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>&mdash;could be used so that the length of the traction mechanism could be significantly shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment changed in this way or in the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the stitching device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is also formed by a stationarily arranged forming and driving device (not illustrated) and a bending device integrated into the collecting support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; instead of a rotor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> a driven deflection drum <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The further advantages of the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> are contained also in the alternative device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. Further explanations in regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> therefore seem to be unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> which has a computer part R and a control part S which is connected in a control-effecting way to the individual components of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail to illustrate the inventive principles, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles. </paragraph>
