<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a drive method and drive apparatus for a display panel, which based on an input image signal, selectively applies a plurality of drive pulses that correspond to the gradation of the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, much attention has been placed on display devices such as plasma display panels, and there is much expectation that the displays will be made larger and thinner. In the video display devices that use these kinds of display devices, it is necessary to maintain stable image characteristics for a long period of time. Generally, it is assumed that the life of a plasma display is about 3,000 to 5,000 hours, so it is desired that the discharge characteristics of the plasma display panel be kept uniform during this time in order to maintain good image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, when light is repeatedly emitted from the discharge cells of the plasma display panel over a long period of time, the resulting change in the discharge characteristics cannot be avoided. For example, when a plasma display is used for a long period of time and the discharge voltage of the discharge cells drops making it impossible to emit enough light, the image quality of the display screen becomes poor. Therefore, when using a display such as a plasma display panel, even though the image quality is initially good, there is a problem in that it is difficult to continuously maintain good image quality due to changes that occur from use over a long period of time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the invention is explained below based on the drawings. In this embodiment, the invention is applied to a video display apparatus that uses a plasma display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the major construction of the video display apparatus of this embodiment. The video display apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises: an A/D converter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, display-data-generation unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, address driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, APL calculation unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, total light emission calculation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, total usage time calculation unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the construction described above, the A/D converter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> synchronizes the input analog image signal with a specified timing signal and digitizes the signal to convert it to digital image data. The image data that are output from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are a plurality of picture element data that are arranged to make of the display screen and, 8 bits for example, are allotted for each picture element data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The display-data-generation unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> stores the image data that are output from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and properly adjusts the brightness, gamma correction, and gradation for each field, and generates display data that conforms to the sub-field method, which is a method for driving the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and which will be described later. The display-data-generation unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, output the display data to be displayed to the address driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at timing that is specified by the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Based on the display data of the display screen, the address driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates data pulses that correspond to the picture element data and that are to be applied to the &lsquo;m&rsquo; number of address terminals D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dm on the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Also, the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> generates reset pulses and sustain pulses, as drive pulses to be applied to an &lsquo;n&rsquo; number of sustain terminals X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Xn on the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a specified timing. Similarly, the Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generates reset pulses, scanning pulses and sustain pulses, as drive pulses to be applied to an &lsquo;n&rsquo; number of sustain terminals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Yn on the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a specified timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a display device having <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-electrode surface discharge construction in which sustain electrodes X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Xn and sustain electrodes Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Yn are arranged parallel in the area corresponding to the display screen, and where address electrodes D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dm are cross them. Also, the layer of the PDP in which the 3 electrodes are formed is covered by a dielectric surface to form a discharge space, and a discharge cell that corresponds to one picture element is formed at each electrode intersection, and by applying pulses corresponding to the display data, it is possible to display a desired image on the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next, the method for driving the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, based on the sub-field method, will be explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as a reference. In the video display apparatus of this embodiment, in order to perform gradation representation of the video, one field is divided into a plurality of sub-fields, and address discharge and sustain discharge is performed in each sub-field to drive the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Generally, in the NTSC format, thirty image frames are formed per second, and since there are two fields in one frame, this corresponds to sixty fields per second. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each field comprises &lsquo;N&rsquo; number of sub-fields (SF), and each sub-field comprises a reset period, address period and sustain period. Also, the length of the sustain period starting from the first sub-field to the Nth sub-field is gradually increased so that it is possible to apply the specified number of sustain pulses corresponding to the brightness desired for a discharge cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the waveform pattern of the pulses that correspond to the ith sustain electrode Xi and sustain electrode Yi and that are applied during the reset period, address period and sustain period. First, in the reset period, a negative voltage reset pulse RPx is applied to the sustain electrode Xi, while at the same time, a positive voltage reset pulse RPy is applied to the sustain electrode Yi. When this happens, reset discharge occurs at the same time for all of the discharge cells, and the reset discharge is finished, a specified amount of barrier charge is generated in each discharge cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, during the address period, a negative-voltage scanning pulse SP is applied to the sustain electrode Yi at the timing when high-voltage or low-voltage data pulses DP are applied to the address electrodes D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dm. At this time, through the action of a selected blocking discharge, when a scanning pulse SP is applied, a discharge occurs in a discharge cell to which a high-voltage data pulse DP is applied, and the barrier change is removed. On the other hand, in a discharge cell to which a low-voltage data pulse DP is applied, no discharge occurs when a scanning pulse SP is applied, so the barrier charge is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Next, during the sustain period, a positive-voltage sustain pulse IPx is applied to the sustain electrode Xi, and after a specified interval, a positive-voltage sustain pulse IPy is applied to the sustain electrode Yi. Each time the sustain pulse IPx and sustain pulse IPy are alternately applied in this way, electro luminescence repeatedly occurs in the discharge cells in which the barrier charge remains. Here, when the video display apparatus is used for a long period of time, degradation of the image quality of the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> occurs due to change over time of the discharge characteristics of the discharge cells. Therefore, in this embodiment, as will be described later, the value of the voltages on the sustain pulses IPx, IPy and the timing at which they are applied is controlled to compensate for change over time of the discharge characteristics of the discharge cells. The method will be described in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for the image data that are output from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the APL calculation unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> calculates the APL (Average Picture Level), which is the average brightness level for the image data for each field. When the brightness level range is expressed as 0 to 1, the APL value approaches 0 for a black display screen, and approaches 1 for a white display screen. The APL value that is calculated by the APL calculation unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is then output to the total light emission calculation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The total light emission calculation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> finds the total number of times that light is emitted in the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for each field based on the aforementioned APL value, and from that, calculates the total number of times light has been emitted. The total number of times that light is emitted in the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for each field is found by multiplying the total number of sustain pulses K in one field by the aforementioned APL value. The total number of sustain pulses K in one field is the total number of sustain pulses K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to KN that correspond to the weighting given to the respective sub-fields. Also, in the case of the video display apparatus of this embodiment it is assumed that there is a function for limiting the brightness level, so the total number of sustain pulses K is determined according to the preset ABL (Automatic Brightness Limiter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows one example of the aforementioned ABL characteristics. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the APL value is expressed as a percentage and is shown along the horizontal axis and the total number of sustain pulses K for one field is shown along the vertical axis. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the APL value is above a specified value, the brightness is limited by gradually decreasing the total number of sustain pulses K as the APL value increases. By limiting the brightness of the display screen according to the total number of sustain pulses K in this way, it is possible to keep the consumed power to a minimum while maintaining the proper brightness for the display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The total number of light emissions for one field that is found from the multiplied product of the total number of sustain pulses K, which is based on the ABL characteristics, and the APL value, is added to the total number of light emissions that is held in the total light emission calculation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and in this way the total number of times light is emitted is continuously updated. This total number of times light is emitted can be held in a non-volatile memory for example. The total number of times light is emitted, which is held in the total light emission calculation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, is output to the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that it can be used for drive control that will be explained later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the total usage time calculation unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> detects the total amount of time the video display apparatus has been used. The total usage time calculation unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> uses a clock (not shown in figure) for detecting when the power supply to the video display apparatus is turned ON and the amount of time the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is driven, and the saved total amount of time the display is used is continuously updated by referencing the clock output. The total usage time that is detected by the total usage time calculation unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is output to the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the same way as the total light emission described above was, so that it can be used for drive control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Next, the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> performs the role of a control device for performing overall control of the operations of the video display apparatus of this embodiment. The control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> controls the operation of the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for driving the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> uses the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used that was obtained as described above in order to properly change the specified amount of drive for driving the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. It is possible for the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to selective determine whether to use the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time in performing control. It is also possible for the user to select the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, detailed examples of methods used by the control <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to control the specified drive amount for the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used are explained. Here, a control method of changing the voltage value of the drive pulses (sustain pulses IPx, IPy and scanning pulse SP) for the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a control method of changing the timing at which the sustain pulses IPx, IPy are applied, are explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows one example of the control method of changing the voltage value of the drive pulses for the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, according to the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, as the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used increases, the voltage value of the drive pulse is gradually increased. When the discharge voltage of the discharge cells of the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> drop due to using the video display apparatus over a long period of time in this way, the voltage of the drive pulses are increased in order to compensate for that voltage drop. Therefore, it is possible to suppress degradation over time of the image quality of the video display apparatus. In the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>,the discharge characteristics of each discharge cell change depending on the temperature condition, so, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, for example, it is possible to perform control such that the voltage of the drive pulses is increased or decreased depending on the operating temperature condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can holds the characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> as a table in a specified memory, and read and set the voltages for the drive pulses for the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this case, the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be constructed such that the output voltage is controlled by an external setting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of the control method of changing the timing at which the sustain pulses IPx, IPy is applied according to the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used. The example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the case of changing the rise timing of the sustain pulses IPx, IPy according to the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sustain pulses IPx, IPy have a trapezoidal waveform pattern. One sustain pulse IPx, IPy is formed by changing from low level to high level at a specified rise time, then maintaining high level for a set time, and finally changing from high level to low level at a specified fall time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown by the solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the initial stage, after a specified time after the fall timing t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the leading sustain pulse IPx, the rise timing t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the following sustain pulse IPy is set. As the total number of light emissions or total amount of time the display is used increases, the rise timing t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the following sustain pulse IPy comes earlier and approaches the fall timing t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the leading sustain pulse IPx. In this way, due to reasons that will be explained later, it is possible instantly increase the discharge voltage of the discharge cell based on the sustain pulse IPy, and thus it is possible to compensate for changes over time of the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> similar to the case of increasing the voltage of the drive pulses as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the case of controlling the rise timing of one sustain pulse IPx, however, the same effect can be obtained by control the rise timing of the other sustain pulse IPy. Also, instead of controlling the rise timing of the sustain pulses IPx, IPy, it is possible to control the fall timing such that the relationship between the sustain pulse IPx and sustain pulse IPy is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Moreover, it is possible to control the rise timing and/or fall timing of the sustain pulses IPx, IPy without changing the pulse width, such that the rising section of one sustain pulse has the same relationship with the falling section of the other sustain pulse as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> will be used to explain the reason why the discharge voltage of the discharge cells instantly increase due to the sustain pulse IPy when the rise timing of the sustain pulse IPy becomes quicker as described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic drawing that shows the circuit configuration of the output circuit of the sustain pulse IPy of the Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the output circuit of the sustain pulse IPy comprises two coils L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and diodes D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to form a resonance circuit. With a voltage Vs supplied from the power supply B, the sustain pulse IPy is generated by controlling the opening and closing of four switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Also, the output circuit for the sustain pulse IPy is connected to a specified discharge cell of the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via one of the sustain electrodes Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Yn, and the output circuit for the sustain pulse IPx is connected to a specified discharge cell of the PDP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via one of the sustain electrodes X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Xn. It is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, however, the output circuits for the other sustain pulses IPx have the same circuit configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the opening and closing of the switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are controlled for the output circuit for the sustain pulse IPy that is constructed as shown above. In that way, the waveform of the sustain pulse IPy rises when the switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is ON, maintains a voltage Vs when the switch S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is ON, and falls when the switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is ON based on the resonance operation of two coils L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, during this time, the switch S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> remains OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the rise timing t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the sustain pulse IPy shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> approaches the fall timing t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the leading sustain pulse IPx, and this case is shown as sustain pulse IPyb in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. When that happens, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in the output circuit for the leading sustain pulse IPx, the period when the switch S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which corresponds to the aforementioned switch S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is OFF, partially overlaps the period when the following sustain pulse IPyb rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the output circuit for the sustain pulse IPy, since the switch S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the output circuit for the sustain pulse IPx, which is connected via the capacitive discharge cell C, is grounded, the discharge current in the discharge cell C instantly increases due to the resonance characteristics. In this case, as shown at the bottom of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the sustain pulse IPyb rises, it instantly exceeds the voltage Vs. Also, as the overlap of the period when the leading sustain pulse IPx falls and the period when the following sustain pulse IPy rises becomes longer, the change in voltage of the sustain pulse IPy becomes larger, so it is possible to increase the discharge voltage of the discharge cell C by just that amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The relationship of the actual amount of control to the total number of light emissions or total amount of time the display is used, and the timing at which the sustain pulses IPx, IPy are applied can be properly set in accordance to the circuit configuration and the discharge characteristics of the discharge cells. Also, in the control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, similar to the voltage value of the aforementioned drive pulse, the control amount for the timing at which to apply the sustain pulses IPx, IPy can be held in a specified memory, and when driving the X-sustain driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or Y-sustain driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to some specified conditions, control can be performed by reading values from a table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the case of using a plasma display panel (PDP) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as the display was explained, however, the invention is not limited to this and it can also be widely applied to a video display apparatus that uses other kinds of displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With the present invention as explained above, when driving a display panel, a specified control amount is controlled such that change over time of the display is compensated for based on the total number of light emissions or the total amount of time the display is used, so it is possible to prevent degradation of the image and to maintain good image quality when using the display panel for a long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-197294 filed on Jun. 28, 2001 including the specification, claims, drawings and summary is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
