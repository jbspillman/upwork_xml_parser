<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention discloses an FSK/GFSK demodulator with digital frequency offset compensation, comprising: an FSK/GFSK signal demodulator, for receiving a transmission signal from an antenna and generating an inter-medium frequency (base-frequency) signal after amplification and filtering; an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), for receiving the inter-medium frequency (base-frequency) signal from the FSK/GFSK signal demodulator and converting the signal into a digital signal; a digital frequency discriminator, for receiving the digital signal from the analog-to-digital converter and generating a discriminated signal; a digital band-pass filter, for filtering off a high-frequency component and a DC component of the discriminated signal and generating a demodulated signal; and a data slicer, for receiving the demodulated signal and generating a received signal. The digital band-pass filter is composed of a digital low-pass filter and a digital high-pass filter connected in series. The FSK/GFSK demodulator with digital compensation for frequency offset according to the present invention employs a digital filter unit to filter off the direct-current (DC) component of the frequency offset of the discriminated signal, and generates a demodulated signal independent of the DC component of the frequency offset. Therefore, the data slicer can correctly determine the demodulated signal without the DC level. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a compensation device for frequency offset and, more particularly, to a frequency shift keying (FSK)/Gaussian frequency shift (GFSK) demodulator with digital frequency offset compensation and the demodulating method of the same. The FSK/GFSK demodulator of the present invention employs a digital filter to filter off the direct-current (DC) component of the frequency offset of the FSK/GFSK demodulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to the limitations such as size and cost, frequency synthesizers, quartz oscillators and other devices providing high precision oscillating frequencies fail to generate radio frequencies. Therefore, a general radio-frequency unit performs frequency offset between a transmission side and a reception side by using automatic frequency control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram showing a conventional FSK/GFSK demodulator. As shown in the figure, the receiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an antenna <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a RF-to-IF down converter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a data output unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The RF-to-IF down converter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> filters and amplifies a signal received by the antenna <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and further comprises a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> for extracting a signal having a necessary band from the received signal, a RF amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for amplifying the level of the signal passing through the band-pass filter to a necessary level, a mixer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for decreasing the frequency of the received signal to a necessary frequency, an oscillator <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for generating the necessary frequency, a IF amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> for amplifying the level of the received signal to a necessary level, and a limiter <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for limiting the amplitude of the received signal. The antenna <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives a radio-frequency signal emitted from a transmission side (not shown), and then generates a signal to be transmitted to the RF-to-IF down converter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The RF-to-IF down converter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extracts the required frequency range from the received signal, and outputs a signal representing the frequency range after amplification. Finally, the frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> demodulates the output signal and the demodulated signal is output from the output unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. However, in such a communication system, the frequency offset of the carrier between the transmission side and the reception side may lead to a DC component included in the output signal from the frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which may cause malfunction of the output unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The output unit of a conventional FSK/GFSK receiver employs an analog low-pass filter composed of a resistor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> so as <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to obtain a DC level of the output signal from the frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The DC level is then compared to the output signal from the frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a comparator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> so as to obtain a demodulated signal. The output signal from the frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> charges the capacitor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> via a buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and a control switch <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> controls the time so as to obtain the DC level from the frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Finally, the control switch <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is turned off so as to generate a correct demodulated signal based on a voltage stored in the capacitor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> as a level for the comparator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the output unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has several problems that may adversely affect the correctness of the demodulated signal. Firstly, the switching time of the control switch <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> strongly depends on the correctness of the obtained DC level. Secondly, the resistance/capacitance values of the resistor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> must be evaluated respectively according to the associate system. Thirdly, the control switch <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is controlled by a next-stage control unit (not shown) that may increase the cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention providing an FSK/GFSK demodulator with digital frequency offset compensation and the demodulating method of the same can be exemplified by the preferred embodiments as described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a schematic block diagrams showing an FSK/GFSK demodulator with digital frequency offset compensation in accordance with the present invention. In the figure, the FSK/GFSK demodulator according to the present invention is similar to the conventional FSK/GFSK demodulator (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), both comprising an antenna <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a RF-to-IF down converter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Most of the elements used in the FSK/GFSK demodulator according to the present invention are the same as those used in the conventional FSK/GFSK demodulator (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Therefore, repeated description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the FSK/GFSK demodulator according to the present invention further comprises an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a digital frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a finite impulse response digital low-pass filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an infinite impulse response digital filter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a data slicer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives a signal from the RF-to-IF down converter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and converts the signal into a digital signal (DS). The digital signal is then discriminated by the digital frequency discriminator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to be a discriminated signal with a certain frequency. The discriminated signal is later filtered by the finite impulse response digital low-pass filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to filter off the high-frequency component of the discriminated signal and generating a first demodulated signal. Furthermore, first demodulated signal is filtered by the infinite impulse response digital filter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to filter off the DC component so as to obtain a second demodulated signal without the DC component. The second demodulated signal is converted by the data slicer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to obtain a received signal. Since the second demodulated signal generated by the infinite impulse response digital filter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does not have the DC component, the data slicer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> only needs a comparator <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, and the demodulated signal will not be affected by the DC offset voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagrams showing one embodiment of some devices in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the frequency of the input inter-mid frequency signal is 1 MHz. The symbol rate of the signal is 1 Mbps, and the sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> fs&equals;32 MHz. Moreover, the transfer function of the finite impulse response digital low-pass filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is h(z)&equals;h<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;h<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>z<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>&plus; . . . &plus;h<highlight><subscript>63</subscript></highlight>z<highlight><superscript>&minus;63</superscript></highlight>, the pass-band is in the range from 0 to 0.2 MHz, and the stop-band is above 2 MHz. The design of the parameters in h(z) is well-known in the conventional digital signal processing, as described in related literatures and computer-aided design soft-wares (for example, Signal Processing Toolbox of MATLAB<highlight><superscript>R</superscript></highlight>). Furthermore, the transfer function of the infinite impulse response digital filter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> it is found that the frequency response of the digital filter is 0 when the frequency f&equals;0 Hz and f&equals;16 MHz. Since the frequency component over 2 MHz of the first demodulated signal has been filtered off by the finite impulse response digital low-pass filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the infinite impulse response digital filter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used for filtering off the DC component of the demodulated signal. Moreover, the finite impulse response digital low-pass filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the infinite impulse response digital filter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be exchanged in their positions. Alternatively, a band-pass filter according to the prior art digital signal processing can be used to replace the digital low-pass filter and the digital high-pass filter connected in series, so as to filter off both the high-frequency component and the DC component of the discriminated signal. </paragraph>
