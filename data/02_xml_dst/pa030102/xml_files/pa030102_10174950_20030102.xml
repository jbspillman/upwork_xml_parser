<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a propulsion apparatus for a vessel which comprises a main screw and a POD propeller, and, in particular comprises a push type POD propeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, in a propulsion apparatus for a vessel, installation of a POD propeller rearward of a main screw has been proposed in order to add a further propulsive force when the propulsive force generated by the main screw is insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a conventionally proposed example of a propulsion apparatus for a vessel. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a rear portion of the bottom of the vessel, reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a main screw for generating a main propulsive force for moving the vessel, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> denotes a push type POD propeller. The main screw is provided so as to rotate by a driving force generated by an engine such as a diesel engine (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The push type POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used in the above propulsion apparatus is composed of a casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a strut <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a supporting rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed in a cylindrical shape and the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided rearward thereof. The POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates a propulsive force by rotating, and an electric motor (not shown) for driving the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided in the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The strut <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a wing-shaped section and is provided on the upper side of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the supporting rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which acts as a rotational axis of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stands upright from the upper end of the strut <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The supporting rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to a driving mechanism in a hull (not shown), and as a result, the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotatably installed on the rear portion of the bottom of the vessel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the supporting rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The vessel, having the propulsion apparatus for a vessel is moved by the propulsive force obtained by only rotating the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or rotating both the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, when turning the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> around the supporting rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the strut <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> functions as a rudder and a steering force is generated, and as a result, the vessel can be turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional propulsion apparatus for a vessel, since the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the propulsive force obtained by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reduced by an effect of a vortex (hereinafter called &ldquo;hub vortex&rdquo;) generated on a front end portion of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> itself, and the propulsion efficiency of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the vessel is moved, a rotating flow remines in a slipstream of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This means that the energy given to the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is partly consumed as energy for generating the rotating flow and a problem occurs in that the propulsion energy of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is provided in consideration of the above circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to improve the propulsion efficiency of the propulsion apparatus for a vessel by reducing the hub vortex or by utilizing the energy for the rotating flow generated by the main screw. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments will be presented in the following with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. Those parts that are the same as or similar to the conventional parts are given the same reference numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> show a first embodiment of a propulsion apparatus of the present invention. In these figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a rear portion of the bottom of a vessel, reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a main screw, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A denotes a push type POD propeller provided rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The propulsion apparatus is composed of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. In addition, reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a casing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a POD screw, reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes a strut, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a supporting rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A plurality of grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided on a front end portion of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. These grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided so as to extend along the flow directions of a hub vortex generated by the rotation of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the vessel moves forward, that is, the grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided so as to extend along the flow directions of the vortex which is formed at the central part of the rotating flow generated rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in the figures, six grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided on the front end portion of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> along the circumference of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at regular intervals, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, each groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inclined to the right side as it extends away from the axis of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, when the grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are viewed from the position of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The number of grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is not limited to that of the embodiment shown in the figures and can be suitably varied. It is needless to say that the inclined directions of the grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are reversed when the rotational direction of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for moving the vessel forward is reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to the propulsion apparatus for a vessel having the above-described features, the rotating flow generated by the rotation of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> flows along the grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is diffused by the grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As a result, the hub vortex generated by the rotating flow is weakened and the pressure drop at the low pressure area caused by the hub vortex is reduced. Therefore, the force (resistance), which is generated by the low pressure area and which pulls the hub of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearward, is reduced, and consequently, the loss of the propulsive force is reduced and the propulsion efficiency of the propulsion apparatus for a vessel is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> show a second embodiment of a propulsion apparatus of the present invention. In these figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a rear portion of the bottom of the vessel, reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a main screw, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B denotes a push type POD propeller provided rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The propulsion apparatus is composed of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B. In addition, reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a casing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a POD screw, reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes a strut, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a supporting rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A plurality of stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided on a front end portion of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B. These stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided so as to extend along the longitudinal direction of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in the figures, seven stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided on the front end portion of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> along the circumference of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at regular intervals, and protrude in the radial direction of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. However, the number of stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not limited to that of the embodiment shown in the figures, and can be suitably varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided for converting the rotating flow generated by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into a propulsive force. The mechanism by which the stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> convert the rotating flow into the propulsive force is briefly explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The rotating flow is divided into a component which moves directly rearward (toward the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B) along the rotational axis of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a component which rotates around the rotational axis of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The energy of the former component (hereinafter called &ldquo;direct energy&rdquo;) acts as the propulsive force of the vessel, however, the energy of the latter component (hereinafter called &ldquo;rotational energy&rdquo;) does not act as a propulsive force of the vessel and is consequently wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When a plurality of stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which protrude in the radial direction of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided on the front end portion of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the rotating flow from the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is altered by the stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to change the flow direction toward the rear side. As a result, the rotational energy which was wasted is converted into the direct energy, and the direct energy which acts as the propulsive force of the vessel is increased. Therefore, the propulsion efficiency of the propulsion apparatus for a vessel is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Note that the output from the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B does not always coincide with that of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the output from the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B is less than that of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, even if the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which rotates in a direction opposite toward the rotational direction of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is employed, the total rotational energy generated by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> cannot be utilized by the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, 50% of the rotational energy may be utilized by the stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the remaining 50% of the rotational energy may be utilized by the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of a propulsion apparatus of the present invention. In this figure, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a rear portion of the bottom of a vessel, reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a main screw, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C denotes a push type POD propeller provided rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The propulsion apparatus is composed of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C. In addition, reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a casing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a POD screw, reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes a strut, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a supporting rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C is provided so that the rotational axis (central axis) of the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the rotational axis of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same. Furthermore, a hub portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a front end portion of the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C (a front end portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) are roughly uniformly continues and form a rough spindle shape. Here, it is preferable that the space between the hub portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the front end portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>be minimized as much as possible to maintain the uniformity between the hub portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the front end portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to the propulsion apparatus for a vessel having the above-described features, since the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C form one substantially continuous body which has a rough spindle shape, the rotating flow generated by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is removed to the outside along the surfaces of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As a result, the velocity of the slipstream from the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which flows into the POD screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes slower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Consequently, since the hub vortex generated in the slipstream is altered, i.e., it becomes difficult to generate a hub vortex; the force (resistance) which is generated by the low pressure area caused by the hub vortex and which pulls the hub of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearward is reduced. Therefore, the loss in the propulsive force is reduced, and the propulsion efficiency of the propulsion apparatus for a vessel is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show a fourth embodiment of a propulsion apparatus of the present invention. In these figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a rear portion of the bottom of a vessel, reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a main screw, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D denotes a push type POD propeller provided rearward of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The propulsion apparatus is composed of the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the POD propeller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D. In addition, reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a casing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a POD screw, reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes a strut, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a supporting rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A pair of fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided on the right and left sides of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to be positioned symmetrically around the axis of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and extend horizontally. Each fin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a wing-shaped section, and it is preferable that a leading edge portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each fin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> be twisted along direction of the water flow (rotating flow) which is generated by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to the propulsion apparatus for a vessel having the above-described features, the rotating flow generated by the main screw <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is converted into a propulsive force by the fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> due to a mechanism similar to that of the stator fins <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> described in the second embodiment. Therefore, the propulsion efficiency of the propulsion apparatus for a vessel is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Note that the number of fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is not limited to a pair of fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which are provided on both sides of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and which extend horizontally, and two or more fins may be provided on each side of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at predetermined angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In addition, the features of the present invention are not limited to that of the above-described embodiments, and they can be modified as long as they are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
