<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the drive voltage for a sustain driver and a scan driver has been adjusted by adjusting variable resistance upon shipment so as to secure an amount of margin corresponding to an influence upon the PDP by a change in temperature upon operation, a change of the PDP itself by time passage and the like. More specifically, a voltage adjusting circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is inserted during a supply of electric power to the aforementioned driver and the variable resistor R<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is adjusted so as to correct the voltage of an input to an amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> thereby adjusting the driving voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional technology about the driving circuit of the PDP unit has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-293135. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, it takes skill for adjustment of this PDP and therefore there is a limit in reduction of adjustment cost. Further, there is a room in which human error may be induced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The intensity of illumination is changed by a change in temperature at the time of startup and after long-hour use and this intensity of illumination is changed by a change with time passage of the PDP itself also. However, the change in the intensity of illumination in the PDP cannot be eliminated completely by adjustment of a single time before shipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-293135, the power supply is described only a symbol of the DC power supply in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is not described about a voltage adjusting function. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an embodiment of a plasma display panel (PDP) unit of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanied drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an outline of the PDP unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The PDP unit comprises an input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a D/A converter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A PDP drive circuit acting as a panel driving device includes an address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Further, a PDP display unit includes a temperature detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which works as a temperature detecting device for the display panel, a usage time counting circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which works as a usage time counting device for the display panel, and an external control signal receiver <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which works as an external control signal receiving device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A video signal inputted from the input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is converted to digital video data by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, processed to display data by the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and then supplied to the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> computes emission time corresponding to the intensity of illumination of video data and corrects the data by reallocation so as to generate display data. The frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is composed of, for example, a VRAM, which accumulates display data of a screen sent from the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and supplies it to the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> following synchronous signal from a control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which will be described later. The address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of a driving circuit having a DC power supply and switching device, and generates pixel data pulse to each discharge cell on the display panel based on the display data inputted from a frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and applies this to a column electrode Dj for every display line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of, for example, CPU, which outputs synchronous signal to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Further, the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which works as a voltage control device, includes a voltage correction value generating circuit, which works as a voltage correction value generating device, so as to output a voltage correction value to adjust the PDP driving voltage. The D/A converter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> converts the voltage correction value that the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs in the form of digital value into an voltage correction value which is an analog signal and outputs it to an X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each of the X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is constituted of a driving circuit containing a DC power supply and switching devices. Based on synchronous signal from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> applies sustain discharge pulse IPx to the electrode Xj and the Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> applies sustain discharge pulse IPy to the electrode Yj. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The temperature detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the display panel detects the temperature of a display panel and outputs the result of detection to the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The usage time computing circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the display panel computes a time in which the power of the display panel is turned ON and is part of the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The external control signal receiver <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> receives a control signal from outside, for example, a remote controller or personal computer and outputs its content to the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The operation of the PDP unit having such a structure will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A video signal inputted from the input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as an analog signal is converted to digital video data by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, processed to display data by the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and supplied to the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> accumulates display data sent from the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and supplies it to the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> following synchronous signal from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A synchronous signal is separated from the video signal inputted from the input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by a sync separation circuit (not shown), and then the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs the synchronous signal to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the basis of this separated synchronous signal. The control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> drives the PDP by controlling ON/OFF of a switching device of the PDP driving circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is a panel driving device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Additionally, the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs an appropriate voltage correction value by computing a drive voltage of the PDP according to the result of temperature detection on the display panel and usage time of the display panel. Further, the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> receives a control signal from outside, for example, a remote controller or a personal computer, and computes a voltage correction value depending upon its content, and outputs. At this time, the D/A converter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> converts the voltage correction value to be outputted by the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as digital value to analog value and outputs the result to the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> facilitates adjustment of the driver voltage by means of a voltage adjusting circuit, which will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The drive sequence of the PDP unit will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing the drive sequence of the PDP according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A set of a sub-field (1 SF) has a reset period, an address period, and a sustain period. A set of a field, which is a drive sequence of the PDP, has several sub-fields, repeated N times, and thereafter a main erase process for resetting to a condition in which wall charge is erased by applying erase pulse respectively to all cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the reset period, all the discharge cells of the PDP unit are gotten into luminous discharge cell condition. In the subsequent address period, the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forms wall charge selectively to each discharge cell based on video signal so as to generate pixel data pulse which sets up luminous discharge cell or non-luminous discharge cell and apply this pulse to a column electrode of every display line. In the sustain period, sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>are generated alternately and applied to the column electrode X and column electrode Y alternately. As a result, in a luminous discharge cell in which the above-described wall charge remains, discharge light emission is repeated and then that light emission is sustained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The PDP unit of this embodiment adjusts the voltage of the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the address period and the sustain period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the structure of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which works as a panel drive device, is comprised of the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a reset pulse driver portion and a first sustain driver portion. The Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a reset pulse driver portion, a scan driver portion, and a second sustain driver portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The reset pulse driver portion applies a reset pulse respectively to all the column electrodes X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-Y<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>at the same time in the reset period. Consequently, all the discharge cells in the PDP unit are simultaneously discharged and excited to generate charged particles. After this discharge is stopped, a predetermined quantity of wall charges are accumulated on a dielectric layer of the discharge cells, so that luminous discharge cell condition is attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The scan driver portion applies a scan pulse SP to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>in the address period so as to set the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>to a predetermined positive potential (V<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>off</subscript></highlight>). This application is carried out synchronously with application of pixel data pulse DP<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, of the cells of the column electrode on which the scan pulse SP is applied, discharge occurs in only a cell onto which pixel data pulse of positive voltage is applied at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The first sustain driver portion and the second sustain driver portion generate sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>alternately in the sustain period and apply it to the column electrodes X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and the column electrodes Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-Y<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>alternately. Consequently, discharge light emission is repeated in the light emission discharge cell in which the wall charge remains, and the light emission is sustained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The operation of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the above described structure will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The column electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is an electrode at the column j (one electrode composing the j display line) in the column electrodes X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and the column electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is an electrode at the column j (the other electrode composing the j display line) in the column electrodes Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-Y<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. The display panel cell is located between the column electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>and Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>which form a pair and acts as a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. A power supply B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> outputs sustain voltage V<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and the voltage changes depending on an input of the voltage correction value from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A power supply B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputs a reset voltage V<highlight><subscript>r1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The power supply B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs the sustain voltage V<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and the voltage changes depending on input of the voltage correction value from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The power supply B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> outputs the reset voltage V<highlight><subscript>r1</subscript></highlight>. The power supply B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> generates the voltage V<highlight><subscript>off </subscript></highlight>and the power supply B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> generates the scan pulse voltage V<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>including the analog voltage correction value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Because the voltage correction value can be inputted to the power supplies B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the sustain voltage can be adjusted and because the voltage correction value can be inputted to the power supply B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the scan pulse voltage can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A voltage adjusting circuit for use in the sustain driver power supplies B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the scan driver power supply B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having such a structure will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an outline diagram of the voltage adjusting circuit of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The voltage adjusting circuit of this embodiment is a drive voltage changing device and includes a loop circuit comprised of an amplifier, a transistor Tr and resistor R<highlight><subscript>41 </subscript></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Hereinafter, a loop gain is as A for describing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the operation of the voltage adjusting circuit having the above-described structure will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If analog voltage V<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plusmn;&agr; containing &plusmn;&agr; analog voltage correction value in its original input voltage V<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is inputted into the voltage adjusting circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> from the control portion, an increase/decrease amount &Dgr;V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&plusmn;A&middot;&agr; is added to the original output voltage V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>because the loop gain is A, so that the output voltage V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plusmn;&Dgr;V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is applied to the driver. Thus, the voltage correction value &plusmn;&Dgr;V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>acts on the driver so as to enable adjustment of the driver drive voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The voltage adjusting circuit having such a structure is disposed at power supplies B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the voltage correction value outputted from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inputted as analog voltage correction value through the D/A converter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sustain voltage can be adjusted at the power supplies B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The scan pulse voltage can be adjusted at the power supply B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The operation of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having such a structure will be described with reference to a time chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The drive sequence of this PDP describes the operation in a single sub-field. Subsequently, the reset period, address period, and sustain period will be described separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> First, in the reset period, a switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned ON, and at the same time, switching devices S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned ON. The other switching devices are kept OFF. When the switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is turned ON, current flows from the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>to a negative terminal of the power supply B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the switching device S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is turned ON, current flows into the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>from a positive terminal of a power supply B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through a switching device S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The potential of the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is decreased gradually depending upon time constant of a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>and the resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that a reset pulse RP<highlight><subscript>X </subscript></highlight>is generated. The potential of the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is increased gradually depending on time constant of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>and the resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that a reset pulse RP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>is generated. Then, the potential of the reset pulse RP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is saturated to the voltage level &minus;V<highlight><subscript>r1 </subscript></highlight>and the potential of the reset pulse RP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>is saturated to the voltage level V<highlight><subscript>r1</subscript></highlight>. This reset pulse RP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is applied to all the column electrodes X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>at the same time and the reset pulse RP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>is applied to all the column electrodes Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-Y<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When these reset pulses RP<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, RP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>are applied at the same time, all discharge cells of the PDP are discharged and excited at the same time so as to generate charged particles. After this discharge is stopped, a predetermined quantity of wall charge is accumulated on dielectric layers of all discharge cells, so that luminous discharge cell condition is attained. When the reset pulses RP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and RP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>are saturated after a predetermined time interval elapses, the switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the switching device S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are turned OFF before the reset period is terminated. At the same time, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are turned ON and the electrodes X<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>are grounded. The reset period is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, in the address period, the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forms wall charge selectively to each discharge cell based on display data outputted by the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, pixel data pulses DP<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-DP<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>generate and the pulses set the cells the luminous discharge cells or non-luminous discharge cells. This process is applied to the column electrodes D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-D<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>for every display line. Pixel data pulses DP<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>, DP<highlight><subscript>j&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>are applied to the electrodes Y<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>j&plus;1</subscript></highlight>. When the address period is started, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are turned OFF, and the switching devices S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are turned ON, and simultaneously the switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned OFF. If the switching devices S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are turned ON, positive potential (V<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>off</subscript></highlight>) is applied to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. Because as described above, the power supply B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> generates scan pulse voltage V<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>containing analog voltage correction value, the positive potential (V<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>off</subscript></highlight>), which is applied to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>at this time, also contains voltage correction value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The switching device S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned OFF synchronously with application of the pixel data pulse DP<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned ON. Consequently, a negative potential indicating the voltage &minus;V<highlight><subscript>off </subscript></highlight>at a negative terminal of the power supply B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is applied to as a scan pulse SP the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>through the switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Then, the switching device S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned ON synchronously with termination of the pixel data pulse DP<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned OFF, so that a predetermined positive potential (V<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>off</subscript></highlight>) is applied to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. After that, the scan pulse SP is applied to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>also synchronously with application of the pixel data pulse DP<highlight><subscript>j&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> like the case of the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the discharge cell belonging to the column electrode onto which the scan pulse SP is applied, discharge occurs only in a discharge cell onto which pixel data pulse of positive voltage is applied at the same time, so that wall charge of the cell erases. On the other hand, no discharge occurs in a discharge cell on which pixel data pulse of positive voltage is not applied at the same time although the scan pulse is applied and therefore, wall charge of the cell remains. In this case, the discharge cell in which the wall charge remains turns to a luminous discharge cell, while a discharge cell in which the wall charge is erased turns to a non-luminous discharge cell. When the address period is switched over to the sustain period, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are turned OFF and at the same time, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are turned ON. The switching device S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is kept ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Finally, the sustain period begins, the switching device S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned ON. Consequently, current, whose origin is an electric charge accumulated in the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, flows to the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>through a coil L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the switching device S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to charge the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. At this time, the potential of the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is raised gradually depending on time constant of the coil L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. When half cycle of resonance cycle by the coil L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>elapses, the switching device S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned ON. Consequently, the potential of the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>turns to an equal potential to the sustain voltage V<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>containing the voltage correction value of the power supply B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After a predetermined time elapses, the switching device S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned ON. As a result, current flows to the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a coil L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the switching device S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on charge accumulated in the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>so as to charge the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this time, the potential of the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>lowers gradually depending on time constant of the coil L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>When half cycle of resonance cycle by the coil L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>elapses (when the potential of the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>reaches 0V), the switching device S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By such operation, the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> applies sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>to the electrode X<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. At the same time when the switching device S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for erasing the sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is turned ON, the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> turns ON the switching device S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and turns OFF the switching device S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the switching device S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is turned ON, the potential of the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is at grounding potential of 0V. When the switching device S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned ON while the switching device S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is turned OFF, current flows to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>through a coil L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a diode D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the switching device S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a switching device S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a diode D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> based on electric charge accumulated on the capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is charged. At this time, the potential at the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>rises gradually depending upon time constant of the coil L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the half cycle of resonance cycle by the coil L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>elapses, the switching device S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is turned ON. As a result, the potential of the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>turns to an equal potential to the sustain voltage V<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>containing the voltage correction value of the power supply B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If, after a predetermined time elapses, the switching device S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned ON, current flows to the capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a switching device S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a coil L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a diode D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the switching device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> based on electric charge accumulated in the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>so as to charge the capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At this time, the potential of the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>drops gradually depending upon time constant of the coil L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. When the half cycle of resonance cycle by the coil L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>elapses (when the potential of the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>reaches 0V), the switching device S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned OFF while the switching device S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> By such operation, the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> applies sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>of positive voltage to the electrode Y<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. In the sustain period, the sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and the sustain discharge pulse IP<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>are generated alternately and applied to the column electrode X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and the column electrodes Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-Y<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>alternately. As a result, the luminous discharge cell in which the wall charge remains repeats discharge light emission so as to sustain its light emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the temperature detector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> detects the temperature of the display panel, and the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs a voltage correction value from that value. Because the drive voltage is adjusted through the D/A converter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, automatic adjustment of the power voltage is enabled based on the panel temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further, because the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with the usage time computing circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for the display panel, it can output a voltage correction value corresponding to a passage time from the startup of the PDP unit, and can compute and output the voltage correction value by integrating PDP usage time and considering deterioration of brightness due to a change of the PDP with time passage. Because the analog voltage correction value is applied to the PDP drive circuit through the D/A converter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, automatic adjustment of the drive voltage corresponding to the change of the PDP with time passage is enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, by providing with the external control signal receiver <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for receiving an external control signal from a remote controller, a personal computer or the like, the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can output the voltage correction value corresponding to the external control signal so as to adjust the drive voltage. Consequently, the voltage can be adjusted by remote control or through the personal computer without removing a cover of the PDP main body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
