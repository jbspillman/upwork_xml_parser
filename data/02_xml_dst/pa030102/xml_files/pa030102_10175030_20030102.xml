<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method is provided for giving signal quality feedback in a wireless network. First, a transmitting device sends a data packet to a receiving device in a data signal. This data signal is sent at a first transmission power and a first data transmission rate. The receiving device receives the data packet in the data signal and determines a signal quality metric for the data signal. The receiving device then sends an acknowledgement frame to the transmitting device in an acknowledgement signal. The acknowledgement frame includes one or more feedback bits, which indicates a relative signal quality of the data signal. The transmitting device receives the acknowledgement frame in the acknowledgement signal at the transmitting device, and adjusts the first transmission power and the first data transmission rate to a second transmission power and a second data transmission rate, respectively, based on the one or more feedback bits. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to wireless personal area networks and wireless local area networks. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems, methods, devices, and computer program products for controlling transmitted power and transmission rate in a wireless personal area network or wireless local area network environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The International Standards Organization&apos;s (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standard provides a seven-layered hierarchy between an end user and a physical device through which different systems can communicate. Each layer is responsible for different tasks, and the OSI standard specifies the interaction between layers, as well as between devices complying with the standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the hierarchy of the seven-layered OSI standard. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the OSI standard 100 includes a physical layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a data link layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a network layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a transport layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a session layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a presentation layer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and an application layer <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The physical (PHY) layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical, mechanical, functional, and procedural level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier. The data link layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> describes the representation of bits on the physical medium and the format of messages on the medium, sending blocks of data (such as frames) with proper synchronization. The networking layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> handles the routing and forwarding of the data to proper destinations, maintaining and terminating connections. The transport layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> manages the end-to-end control and error checking to ensure complete data transfer. The session layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogs between the applications at each end. The presentation layer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> converts incoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to another. The application layer <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is where communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The IEEE 802 Committee has developed a three-layer architecture for local networks that roughly corresponds to the physical layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the data link layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the OSI standard 100. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the IEEE 802 standard 200. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the IEEE 802 standard 200 includes a physical (PHY) layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a media access control (MAC) layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and a logical link control (LLC) layer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The PHY layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> operates essentially as the PHY Layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the OSI standard 100. The MAC and LLC layers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> share the functions of the data link layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the OSI standard 100. The LLC layer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> places data into frames that can be communicated at the PHY layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>; and the MAC layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> manages communication over the data link, sending data frames and receiving acknowledgement (ACK) frames. Together the MAC and LLC layers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are responsible for error checking as well as retransmission of frames that are not received and acknowledged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a wireless network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that could use the IEEE 802.15 standard 200. In a preferred embodiment the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is a wireless personal area network (WPAN), or piconet. However, it should be understood that the present invention also applies to other settings where bandwidth is to be shared among several users, such as, for example, wireless local area networks (WLAN), or any other appropriate wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When the term piconet is used, it refers to a network of devices connected in an ad hoc fashion, having one device act as a controller (i.e., it functions as a master) while the other devices follow the instructions of the controller (i.e., they function as slaves). The controller can be a designated device, or simply one of the devices chosen to function as a controller. One primary difference between devices and the controller is that the controller must be able to communicate with all of the devices in the network, while the various devices need not be able to communicate with all of the other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and a plurality of devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> serves to control the operation of the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As noted above, the system of controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may be called a piconet, in which case the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be referred to as a piconet controller (PNC). Each of the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> must be connected to the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> via primary wireless links <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and may also be connected to one or more other devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> via secondary wireless links <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Each device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be a different wireless device, for example, a digital still camera, a digital video camera, a personal data assistant (PDA), a digital music player, or other personal wireless device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be the same sort of device as any of the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, except with the additional functionality for controlling the system and the requirement that it communicate with every device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments the controller may be a separate designated device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The various devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are confined to a usable physical area <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, which is set based on the extent to which the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can successfully communicate with each of the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Any device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that is able to communicate with the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (and vice versa) is within the usable area <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As noted, however, it is not necessary for every device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to communicate with every other device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> or a device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> from the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> or device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes a physical (PHY) layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a media access control (MAC) layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, a set of upper layers <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, and a management entity <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The PHY layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> communicates with the rest of the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via a primary or secondary wireless link <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. It generates and receives data in a transmittable data format and converts it to and from a format usable through the MAC layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The MAC layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> serves as an interface between the data formats required by the PHY layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and those required by the upper layers <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The upper layers <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> include the functionality of the device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. These upper layers <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may include TCP/IP, TCP, UDP, RTP, IP, LLC, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Typically, the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in a WPAN share the same bandwidth. Accordingly, the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> coordinates the sharing of that bandwidth. Standards have been developed to establish protocols for sharing bandwidth in a wireless personal area network (WPAN) setting. For example, the IEEE standard 802.15.3 provides a specification for the PHY layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the MAC layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in such a setting where bandwidth is shared using time division multiple access (TDMA). Using this standard, the MAC layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> defines frames and superframes through which the sharing of the bandwidth by the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is managed by the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and/or the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> WPANs (or piconets) are networks that are typically used to share information between personal electronic devices confined to within a house, an office, a floor of a building, etc. Accordingly, many users (or nodes) of WPANs are small battery-operated devices. With such devices, it is advantageous to minimize the size of the device as well as the power consumption, thereby extending battery life. Low power transmissions also have the advantage of minimizing interference with other networks. And high transmission rates minimize channel time usage, which is a limited resource. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Factors that influence power consumption include the transmission power each device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> uses, and the transmission rate of each device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. However, there is currently no mechanism in place in the standards, such as the IEEE 802.15.3 standard, to provide signal quality information from a receiver to a transmitter, which feedback would be helpful to enable a user to control its transmitter power or to alter its transmission rate. As a result, there is less opportunity to enhance both power efficiency and optimize data transmission rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Devices currently only receive data regarding the success/failure of packet transmission, which doesn&apos;t provide sufficient information to adjust the transmit rate and power. For implementations that can allow a high packet error rate (PER), statistics are sufficient. However, when very low PERs must be maintained, the errors will be infrequent enough that statistics will not be meaningful. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The inventor of the present invention has recognized that conventional wireless network protocols do not provide adequate feedback for signal quality for data packets transmitted during guaranteed time slots, which prevents the optimization of transmission power and data transmission rate. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a solution to this problem, as well as other problems and deficiencies associated with wireless network protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for giving signal quality feedback in a wireless network. This method includes the steps of: sending a data packet from a transmitting device to a receiving device in a wireless data signal sent over a wireless link at a first transmission power and a first data transmission rate; receiving the data packet in the wireless data signal at a receiving device; determining at the receiving device a signal quality metric for the wireless data signal; sending an acknowledgement frame from the receiving device to the transmitting device in a wireless acknowledgement signal, the acknowledgement frame including one or more feedback bits indicating a relative signal quality of the wireless data signal; receiving the acknowledgement frame in the wireless acknowledgement signal at the transmitting device; and adjusting the first transmission power and the first data transmission rate to a second transmission power and a second data transmission rate, respectively, based on the one or more feedback bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The signal quality metric is preferably signal-to-noise ratio, bit error rate, or a received signal strength indication. The acknowledgement frame is preferably an immediate acknowledgement frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably one of the values of the one or more feedback bits indicates that the wireless data signal has a signal quality metric that is above an optimal range. When the feedback bits has this value, either the second transmission power is lower than the first transmission power (i.e., the transmitting device lowers the transmission power), or the second data transmission rate is higher than the first data transmission rate (i.e., the transmitting device raises the data transmission rate. Preferably there are two feedback bits, though there may be more or fewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A first combination of the two feedback bits preferably indicates that the wireless data signal has a signal quality metric that is above an optimal range; a second combination of the two feedback bits preferably indicates that the wireless data signal has a signal quality metric that is within an optimal range; a third combination of the two feedback bits preferably indicates that the wireless data signal has a signal quality metric that is below an optimal range, and a fourth combination of the two feedback bits preferably indicates that no signal quality information has been provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> More generically, the one or more feedback bits preferably indicate whether the signal quality metric of the wireless data signal is within an optimal range, above an optimal range, or below an optimal range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Adjusting the first transmission power and the first data transmission rate to a second transmission power and a second data transmission rate, respectively, can involve having the second transmission power equal the first transmission power and having the second data transmission rate equal the first data transmission rate. In other words, if the data signal is in the optimum range, the transmission power and the data transmission rate need not change at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Consistent with the title of this section, the above summary is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all the features or embodiments of the present invention. A more complete, although not necessarily exhaustive, description of the features and embodiments of the invention is found in the section entitled &ldquo;DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS.&rdquo;</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below. And while the embodiments described herein will be in the context of a WPAN (or piconet), it should be understood that the present invention also applies to other settings where bandwidth is to be shared among several users, such as, for example, wireless local area networks (WLAN), or any other appropriate wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a data transmission scheme <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in which information is transmitted through a network via including a plurality of MAC superframes <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> each including guaranteed time slots (GTSs), according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Preferably the superframes <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> are of a set length to allow various devices in the network to coordinate with a network controller or other devices in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the data transmission scheme <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes transmitting successive superframes <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> in time across the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Each superframe <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> includes a beacon <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, an optional contention access period <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, and a contention free period <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. The contention free period <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may include one or more management time slots (MTSs) <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> and one or more guaranteed time slots (GTSs) <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment there are as many guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> as there are primary and secondary wireless links <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. However, this may change in alternate embodiments. There may be greater or fewer guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> than there are devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In this case the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> will designate how the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> should use the available guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> uses the beacon <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> to coordinate the scheduling of the individual devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> into their respective guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. All devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> listen to the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> during the beacon period <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Each device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> will receive zero or more guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, being notified of each start time and duration from the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> during the beacon period <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Channel time allocation (CTA) fields in the beacon <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> include start times, packet duration, source device ID, and destination device ID. As a result, each device knows when to transmit and when to receive. In all other times the device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may cease listening and go into a power conservation mode. The beacon period <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, therefore, is used to coordinate the transmitting and receiving of the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The network can pass control and administrative information between the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the various devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through the optional contention access period <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, the management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, or both. The particular implementation will determine what particular option is used: it could include a contention access period <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, one or more management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, or some combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> can be downlink time slots in which information is sent from the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, or uplink time slots in which information is sent from the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment two management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> are used per superframe, one uplink and one downlink, though alternate embodiments could choose different numbers of management time slots and mixtures of uplink and downlink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> If a new device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> desires to be added to the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, it requests entry from the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> either in the optional contention access period <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> or in one of the management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. If a particular device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has no need to coordinate with the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> during the optional contention access period <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> or the management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, that device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may remain silent during the optional contention access period <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> or the management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. In this case that device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> need not even listen to the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> during the optional contention access period <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> or the management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, and may go into a power-conserving mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Individual devices then transmit data packets during the contention free period <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> use the guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> assigned to them to transmit data packets <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> to other devices (which may include the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> if the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is also a device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> within the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). Each device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may send one or more packets of data <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, and may request an immediate acknowledgement (ACK) frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> from the recipient device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> indicating that the packet was successfully received, or may request a delayed (grouped) acknowledgement. If an immediate ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is requested, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> should allocate sufficient time in the guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> to allow for the ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> to arrive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment a guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is shown as having a plurality of data packets <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and associated ACK frames <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. Generally there is also a delay period <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> between the data packets <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and ACK frames <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, and between a final acknowledgement <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> and the end of the guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Since each particular device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> knows its transmit start time and duration from information received during the beacon period <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, each device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can remain silent until it is its turn to transmit. Moreover, a given device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> need not listen during any guaranteed time slot periods <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> in which it is not assigned to either transmit or receive, and may enter into a power conservation mode. Since the time periods corresponding to each guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> have been fully coordinated by the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> during the beacon period <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, individual devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> know when not to listen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> shown in this embodiment may be of differing sizes. The starting times and durations of the guaranteed time slots <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> are determined by the controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and sent to the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> during the contention access period <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> or one of the management time slots <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, as implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> During each guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> the associated device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> transmits its data packets <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> at a particular power level and data rate. These transmit parameters are chosen primarily to make certain that the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> is successfully transmitted to a receiving device, but also to maximize the data transmission speed and minimize the power consumption and interference. Ideally the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> is transmitted at the lowest power possible to guarantee successful transmission and at as high a speed as possible, while ensuring that the data is transmitted successfully in order to minimize channel time usage. In one embodiment, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> knows that the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> was transmitted successfully when it receives the ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> from the receiving device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a subset of a network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> including a transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and a receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> connected by a secondary wireless link <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, both the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are connected to a controller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> via primary wireless links <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In addition, if one of the devices <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> were a controller as well as a device, the primary wireless link <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> between them could be used for this transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> sends a data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> to the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, and if the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> successfully receives the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, then it sends an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. If the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> does not successfully receive the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, no ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow chart of the transmission of a data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> begins by transmitting a data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> to the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>) This transmission is done over a secondary wireless link <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, unless one of the two devices is also the controller, in which case it may be done over a primary wireless link <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> then determines whether it properly received the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>) If the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> properly received the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, it sends an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>) If the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> did not properly receive the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> (i.e., it did not receive the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> within a set time), no ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is sent. The transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> thus can only tell directly that the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> went through. It determines that the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> did not go through if a certain period of time passes without receiving an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> then proceeds in one of two different ways depending upon whether it received an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> or not. If the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> received an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, it knows that the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> was transmitted at an acceptable power level and an acceptable data transmission rate. Therefore, the transmitting device retains its original transmission power and data transmission rate, moves on to the next data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, and proceeds to the next action. (Step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>) This next action may be the transmission of the next data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> if there is sufficient time remaining in the current guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, or may involve shutting down until either the next superframe <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is transmitted or the next guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> assigned to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If, however, no ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is received, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> has no confirmation that the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> was successfully transmitted and so must resend it. In this case the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> keeps the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, may adjust transmission power and data transmission rate to increase signal quality, and proceeds to the next action. (Step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>) This next action may be the retransmission of the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> if there is sufficient time remaining in the current guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, or may involve shutting down until either the next superframe <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is transmitted or the next guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> assigned to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and then retransmitting the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, if the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> receives an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, it knows only that the data transmission rate and the transmission power are sufficient, but has no knowledge as to whether it is of better quality than it needs to be. It has no metric to determine whether the data transmission rate could be increased or the transmission power decreased and the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> still transmit successfully. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> One thing the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can do to achieve an optimal transmission power or data transmission rate is to increment the transmission rate up and/or the transmission power down until it does not receive an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> from the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. At this point the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will know that it is transmitting at the lowest transmission power and the fastest transmission rate that will still allow the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> to be successfully transmitted. Random errors will of course occur, however, so this is not completely deterministic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> However, using the presence or absence of an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> as the sole determination of an acceptable signal offers very coarse-grained feedback. This can cause an unnecessary loss of data transmission speed as the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> transmits at a lower transmission speed that is optimal, or increased power consumption as the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> transmits at a higher signal quality than is optimal. And while these numbers can be changed, it can only be done slowly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the management entity <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> in the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> may collect signal clarity information such as the bit error rate (BER), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the received signal strength indication (RSSI) of the transmitted data packets <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, or other signal quality metrics. The receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> could then transmit this signal clarity information back to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, where the management entity <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> in the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> could process the signal clarity information to adjust the data transmission speed or transmission power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the device could send suggested rate and power level changes, if the number of feedback bits were sufficient to pass that information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> But using such metrics as BER, SNR, or RSSI will necessitate slow feedback as the necessary metric must be calculated by the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, transmitted from the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in a separate, longer packet, and then processed by the transmitting device to adjust signal strength and data transmission rate. In addition, metrics must be standardized throughout all devices that might be connected to the network. And for such metrics as SNR and RSSI, this could be hard, leading to complications in implementation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In another alternate embodiment, feedback information is put into the immediate ACK frames <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment described below, two-bit feedback is used, although other numbers of feedback bits could be used to allow for greater or lesser granularity of feedback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in Table 1, an embodiment having two feedback bits allows for four separate feedback responses regarding signal quality. In addition, regardless of how many feedback bits are used, if the transmission device receives the ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, then the signal is at a transmission strength and data transmission speed that are sufficient to get the transmission through in a satisfactory manner. If it were not, then the transmission device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> would not have received the ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, and would know to increase the transmission power or decrease data transmission speed accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the feedback bits, if both are &ldquo;0&rdquo; (i.e., a feedback response of &ldquo;0&rdquo;), the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> indicates that the signal quality is poor and that the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> should either increase transmission power or decrease data transmission speed. If the first feedback bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the second feedback bit is &ldquo;1&rdquo; (i.e., a feedback response of &ldquo;1&rdquo;), the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> indicates that the signal quality is within acceptable parameters and that the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> should not change either the transmission power or the data transmission speed. If the first feedback bit is &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the second feedback bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (i.e., a feedback response of &ldquo;2&rdquo;), the receiving device indicates that the SNR is higher than is necessary and that the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> should either decrease transmission power or increase data transmission speed. Finally, if the feedback bits are both &ldquo;1&rdquo; (i.e., a feedback response of &ldquo;3&rdquo;), the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> indicates that no signal quality feedback is provided.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> evaluates the signal quality based on SNR. However, other embodiments can evaluate signal quality based on other criteria such as BER, RSSI, or whatever metric is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the criteria used, this design provides a useful metric that does not specify how the signal quality is evaluated. Rather, it merely indicates to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> whether the data transmission is so weak that that transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> should enhance signal quality, whether the data transmission is adequate so that that transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> should leave signal quality the same, or whether the data transmission is so strong that that transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can afford to cut back on signal quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flow chart of the transmission of a data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Then, the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> determines whether it properly received the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>) If the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> properly received the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, it sends an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> If the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> did not properly receive the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, no ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is sent. This provides the first indication of signal quality to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, i.e., if the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> receives an ACK, the signal quality was at least at a bare minimum, while if a certain period of time passes without receiving an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, the signal quality was not adequate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> then proceeds in one of two different ways depending upon whether it received an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> or not. If no ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> was received, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> has no confirmation that the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> was successfully transmitted and so must resend it. In this case the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> keeps the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, may adjust transmission power and data transmission rate to increase signal quality (Step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>), and proceeds to the next action. (Step <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>) This next action may be the retransmission of the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> if there is sufficient time remaining in the current guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, or may involve shutting down until either the next superframe <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is transmitted or the next guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> assigned to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and then retransmitting the current data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If, however, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> received an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, it knows that the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> was transmitted at an acceptable power level and an acceptable data transmission rate. It then looks at the feedback bits (i.e., the feedback response) to see if the transmission power or data transmission rate should be altered. (Step <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> If the feedback response is &ldquo;0,&rdquo; then the transmitted signal was poor and so the transmitting device adjusts the transmission power or the data transmission rate to increase signal quality. (Step <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>) This may be the same sort of adjustment made when no ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is received, or it may be a more modest change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If the feedback response is &ldquo;1,&rdquo;then the signal is within acceptable parameters and so the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> retains the original transmission power and data transmission rate. (Step <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If the feedback response is &ldquo;2,&rdquo; then the signal is stronger than it needs to be and so the transmitting device adjusts the transmission power or the data transmission rate to use fewer resources while providing adequate signal quality. (Step <highlight><bold>845</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If the feedback response is &ldquo;3,&rdquo; then the no data is transmitted with respect to the signal quality. However, because the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> received an ACK frame <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, the data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> was at least readable, the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can retain the original transmission power and data transmission rate. (Step <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Alternatively if the feedback response were &ldquo;3,&rdquo; the transmitting device could engage in trial and error rate/power changes in the absence of additional feedback data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Finally, once the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> has made what changes to transmission power or data transmission rate are necessary, if any, the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> proceeds to the next action. This next action may be the transmission of the next data packet <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> if there is sufficient time remaining in the current guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, or may involve shutting down until either the next superframe <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is transmitted or the next guaranteed time slot <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> assigned to the transmitting device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The specific metrics and thresholds in this embodiment can be left up to individual implementations, allowing for tremendous flexibility of design. Because the same feedback bits are used regardless of how stringent the data transmission criteria are, no changes need be made for more stringent data transmission standards. In those implementations where the need for consistently high data transmission rates and/or low power consumption is not paramount, high thresholds can be set for when the feedback bits will indicate that the signal quality is too high. Likewise In those implementations where the concern for battery power or transmission speed is highest, lower thresholds can be set for when the feedback bits will indicate that the signal quality is too high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, this design does not require a standardization of SNR or RSSI, nor does it mandate an estimation of BER. By leaving it up to the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to determine when the signal quality is higher than needed or too low, this design allows the receiving device <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to make a decision based on its own criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In fact, the criteria for individual receiving devices <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> may not even be the same, but can vary device to device. For example, in a home network with a PDA, computer, a DVD player, and some digital speakers connected, there may be an entirely different set of criteria for the speakers as compared to the PDA. Because both the DVD and the speakers are plugged into wall sockets, power considerations may be less than the need to minimize missed data packets (and thus skips in the music). Likewise the need for high-speed low error rate transmissions may be great for the speakers to ensure clean sound quality. This may lead to a high threshold before the network will cut back on data transmission speed or power consumption. In contrast, your PDA has a limited power supply, so minimizing power consumption is a high priority and packet errors are more easily tolerated for data transmission. It may have a low threshold for cutting back, accepting a lower quality of service to maximize battery power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In addition, each transmission device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can decide independently what to do with the feedback. It can increase or decrease signal transmitter power, if possible, or it can increase or decrease burst transmission rate to increase or reduce the energy per bit over the noise spectral density (Eb/No) as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> While this application specifically refers to a transmission device and a receiving device, it is understood that both may be operating in each capacity. Thus, each device in the network will at times be both a transmitting device and a receiving device, and will either generate or receive feedback bits. Likewise, the controller may function as a device as well, receiving and generating feedback bits and adjusting its signal quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This application refers throughout to altering the transmission power and the data transmission rate to either raise or lower the signal quality. How exactly this is done may vary, yet stay within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. Specific implementations will vary depending upon system or device criteria. For example, the signal quality can be raised by either lowering data transmission speed or raising transmission power. Likewise, the signal quality can be lowered by either raising data transmission speed or lowering transmission power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As noted, in alternate embodiments a greater or lesser number of bits could be used as feedback bits. If only one bit were used, it might indicate whether the signal quality could be cut back or not. If three or more bits were used, they might indicate to what extent signal quality must be enhanced or could be cut back, with several levels of transmission power/data transmission speed adjustments. Alternatively, the feedback bits could provide other information such as a suggested data transmission rate or a suggested change in power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In addition, although an embodiment has been disclosed that uses immediate acknowledgement (ACK) frames, alternate embodiments could use delayed ACK frames. In this case the transmitting device would send a plurality of data packets before the receiving device sent a delayed ACK frame. This delayed ACK frame would provide acknowledgement information for the plurality of data packets, and could include feedback bits to provide the transmitter with information regarding signal quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
