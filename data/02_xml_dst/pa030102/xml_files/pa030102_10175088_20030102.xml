<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a piezoelectric resonator, a method of manufacturing the piezoelectric resonator, a piezoelectric filter, a method of manufacturing the piezoelectric filter, a duplexer, and an electronic communication device. More particularly, the piezoelectric resonator is used in filters, oscillators, and other suitable devices, thickness longitudinal vibrations are generated in the VHF, UHF, and higher frequency bands, and vibrating portions are provided on a diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The construction of a related piezoelectric resonator of this type includes a thin-film diaphragm that is provided on a substrate having a uniform thickness so as to cover an opening formed in the substrate. A laminated body, in which a piezoelectric thin film is sandwiched by upper and lower electrodes, is mounted on the upper surface of the diaphragm. When a voltage signal is applied between the electrodes, the laminated body as a vibrating portion resonates on the diaphragm. It becomes possible for such a piezoelectric resonator to resonate in higher frequency bands when the piezoelectric film is made thinner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the piezoelectric resonator of this type, the vibrating portion is spaced a fixed distance from the diaphragm fixing ends so that the vibrating portion may perform required vibrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case of a piezoelectric resonator in which a plurality of vibrating portions are provided on a diaphragm, the vibrating portions are located a fixed distance away from each other on the diaphragm so that the resonance characteristics of each of the vibrating portions may not be influenced by the other vibrating portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Then, in such a piezoelectric resonator, to make the resonator smaller, it is considered that the vibrating portions are provided so as to be close to the diaphragm fixing ends and the other vibrating portions. In this case, if the vibrating portions are too close to the diaphragm fixing ends and the other vibrating portions, etc., the size of the piezoelectric resonator can be achieved. But, they influence the vibration characteristics. To the contrary, if the vibrating portions are too far from the diaphragm fixing ends and the other vibrating portions, etc., their influence on the vibration characteristics diminishes or disappears. But, the size becomes larger. Thus, when the vibrating portions are disposed on a diaphragm, it is very difficult to achieve a highly precise position of the vibrating portions. Therefore, the performance of the piezoelectric resonator, and other devices including such a piezoelectric resonator, is degraded or its productivity becomes lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Such disadvantages can be also seen in the filtering characteristics of a filter in which a plurality of these piezoelectric resonators is combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a dual mode filter and ladder filter, the resonators must be separated by a predetermined distance from each other so that the vibration of the adjacent resonators does not influence the other. In case of the dual mode filter, even if the resonators are separated too far from each other, the characteristics do not deteriorate. However, in the case of a ladder filter, the upper electrode or lower electrode of one resonator and the upper electrode or lower electrode of another adjacent resonator are integrally formed and they are required to be electrically connected. Therefore, if a distance between the resonators is greater than 3&lgr; in order to prevent vibrational interference, the wiring between the resonators is lengthened, and the resistance of the wiring and an inductance due to the wiring are generated between the resonators. As a result, the characteristics are deteriorated. In particular, if the wiring resistance is generated between the resonators connected in series, insertion loss is increased. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since both vibrating portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> become vibration affecting elements which affect the vibration characteristics of each other, the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disposed substantially parallel to each other are separated by a distance of about &lgr;/2 or more (i.e., d<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&equals;&lgr;/2 or more) from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The ladder filter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the above-described unique construction is electrically built as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. That is, the first vibrating portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constitutes a first filtering element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the second vibrating portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> constitutes a second filtering element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

The output portion OUT of the ladder filter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to the output portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the second vibrating portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The grounding portion GND of the ladder filter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to the grounding portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the second vibrating portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this way, in the present preferred embodiment, for example, the first vibrating portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is at least about &lgr;/2 away from the vibration affecting elements. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> in which the horizontal axis represents frequencies and the vertical axis represents impedances, the first vibrating portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can achieve its original vibrating characteristics without being influenced by the diaphragm fixing ends and the other vibrating portions which define the other vibration affecting elements. In short, the characteristics line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) shows the case in which the distance from the vibration affecting elements is about 0.48&lgr;, and, since the distance is less than about &lgr;/2, a spurious response is caused. The characteristics line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) shows the case in which the distance from the vibration affecting elements is about 1.0&lgr;, and, since the distance is over &lgr;/2, no spurious response is generated. The characteristics line (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) shows the case in which the distance from the vibration affecting elements is about 4.0&lgr;, and, since the distance is greater than about &lgr;/2, no spurious response is generated at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although the distance between the first vibrating portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the vibration affecting elements is preferably at least about &lgr;/2 as described above, the first vibrating portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is more preferably separated by at least about 1&lgr; from the vibration affecting elements. The same thing can be said about the second vibrating portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as in the first vibrating portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the present preferred embodiment, even if the diaphragm <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made smaller, since the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the diaphragm <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> without being influenced by the vibration affecting elements, preferred embodiments of the present invention achieve a great contribution to miniaturization of the ladder filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the distance between the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the vibration affecting elements is more preferably about 3&lgr; or less. The same thing can be said about the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as in the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When the distance between the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or the vibrating portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the vibration affecting elements is about 3&lgr; or less, the resistance of the wiring between the resonators, the generation of an inductor component by the wiring, and degradation of the characteristics caused such conditions is reliably prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If the distance is greater than about 3&lgr; to prevent vibrational interference, the wiring between the resonators is lengthened, and the resistance of the wiring and the inductance component due to the wiring are generated between the resonators, and, as a result, deterioration of the characteristics is caused. In particular, if the resistance of the wiring is inserted between the resonators connected in series, insertion loss increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention is not limited to the above-described preferred embodiments, and various applications and modification can be considered. </paragraph>
