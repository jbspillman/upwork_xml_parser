<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for collecting blood having a needle containment safety apparatus and method for protecting medical personnel and others from the risk of accidental percutaneous needlestick injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because there are risks associated with accidental needle sticks to a medical person collecting blood, a variety of safety blood collection syringes have been developed. Most of these syringes have a safety shield that slides over an extended needle after the blood is collected. The safety shield may be held in place by a spring, friction, locking tabs or other means. However many of these safety devices require the person to manually place or move the protective shield over the needle thereby providing an opportunity, though slight, for an accidental needle stick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A safety blood collection and transfer device of McCallister, U.S. Pat. No. 6,360,011 is designed to accept a vacuum type blood tube (vacutainer) for collecting blood. McCallister&apos;s invention requires two double pointed needles coupled to each end of a plunger with a hollow core. In addition, a cylindrical syringe and a blood tube holder are required. However the user is required to remove and replace a needle cover providing a slight chance of a stick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The hypodermic safety device of Lockwood, U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,286 is an example of a device having an extendable cover for user protection. Lockwood&apos;s invention has an extension apparatus attached to a standard hypodermic needle that places or disposes a protective cover over an extended needle when a compressed spring is manually released. Lockwood&apos;s patent, in a prior art review, discusses much of the prior art related to protective covers and then describes the improvements provided by his invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a need to new approach for a blood collection device. The present invention does not use an extendable cover, but retracts the needle within a disposable syringe body. A novel device for blood collection, described herein, is less complex than existing and convention devices, is easy to use, and should cost less than most existing devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A blood collection device, that is adapted for use with conventional blood collection tubes (&ldquo;vacutainer&rdquo;) and does not have the complexity of prior art blood collection syringes, has been invented. The blood collection device is easy to operate and is an improvement over prior art devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A blood collection device for use with a conventional collection tube is comprised of a syringe assembly and a sealing assembly. The syringe assembly comprises a syringe body having a tapered distal end and adapted for holding a slidable needle assembly wherein the needle assembly comprises a needle carrier and a double pointed needle, the syringe assembly further has a syringe top, securely attached to the proximal end of the syringe body, for containing the needle assembly within the syringe body. The sealing assembly has an occluding seal inside a cavity of an insertable cylinder that is adapted for pushing the needle assembly towards the distal end of the syringe body or for pulling the needle assembly towards the proximal end of the syringe body. When the occluding seal and seal of the collection tube are punctured by the proximal point of the needle (the distal point of the needle is used to puncture a vein), as the collection tube is pushed into place for blood collection, blood flows into the collection tube. When the collection tube is removed from the insertable cylinder the occluding seal blocks (occludes) blood from contaminating the proximal end of the blood collection device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although those skilled in the art may apply variations to the present invention as characterized in the detailed description, such variations would fall within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The blood collection safety device as described in the figures is fabricated of materials typically used for medical devices of the same type, such as syringes for injecting medication, traditional blood collecting devices and the like. All elements of the device and the assembled device would meet the requirements of corresponding government and medical agencies provided for protection of those practicing and receiving medical services. As new materials are developed that meet the needs for each and every part of the safety device, the device fabricated with the new materials would fall within the scope of the present invention (and claims when a utility application is completed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown a drawing illustrating essential elements of the present invention. A syringe body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is cylinder with a tapered end, the distal end, and a proximal end, no tapering. The proximal end is adapted to receive a needle assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprising a needle carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After the needle assembly is inserted in and contained within the syringe body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> a syringe top <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is bonded via an insertable edge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the inside of the proximal end of the syringe body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Note that the syringe top <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a lock channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the proximal end of the syringe top for receiving a tab which will be described below. A syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is provided when all elements <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is a seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprised of an insertable cylinder <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a twist tab <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, where the insertable assembly encloses or contains an occluding seal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The occluding seal is comprised of a flat seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in an arrangement as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The occluding seal fits inside the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The twist tab <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> engages the lock channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a twisting motion and may be referred to as a bayonet connection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the assembled invention comprising the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> inserted in the syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Other locking methods may also be used and fall within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> represents a first stage, an assembled stage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, of five stages (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) that illustrate the operation of the blood collection safety device in accordance with the present invention. The assembled stage, stage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is accomplished just before blood is to be collected. To reach the assembled stage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which has been advanced by pushing the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the distal direction such that the needle is extending outward from the distal end of the syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is inserted in a blood vessel using the appropriate medical procedure. When blood is observed flowing from the proximal lumen of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the cavity between the punctured flat seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is further advanced until the proximal lumen is embedded in the distal surface of the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thereby stopping blood flow, concomitantly the lock tab <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> snaps into lock groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> providing an irreversible connection. After the twist tab <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is rotated, for a reversible lock, into the lock channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (a bayonet type coupling) the assembled stage is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, for stage <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or a pre-collection stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the vacutainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (collection tube) is positioned within the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Note that the distal end of the vacutainer seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rests against the proximal end of the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and there is no blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Next for stage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a collecting stage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the vacutainer is pushed or urged towards the occluding seal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. When sufficient force is applied to the vacutainer, the proximal point of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> punctures both the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the vacutainer seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The proximal point of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown, goes through the center of the spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the spring is compressed as long as a force is applied to the vacutainer. When the vacutainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is filled with blood and the force is removed, the spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> goes from a compressed position to an extended or normal position and the vacutainer is withdrawn or removed from the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> stage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a removal stage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The spring goes from a compressed mode to an uncompressed mode (the original mode) causing the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to stop blood flow from entering the open section of the seal assembly. Other sealing methods may also be used and fall within the scope of the present invention. The process comprising stages <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is repeated if more than one vacutainer of blood is needed. When all the required blood has been collected the needle is removed from the blood vessel as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrated a stage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a safety stage <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, for the collection device. In order to reach the safety stage the bayonet connection is released and the seal assembly is pulled in a proximal direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The lock tab <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, being irreversibly engaged in the lock groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> pulls the needle from the vein supplying blood and pulls the needle assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inside the syringe body, where the needle assembly (and hence the needle) is locked and held in a safe position within the syringe assembly and seal assembly. When the needle assembly is contained within the syringe assembly, medical and other persons are protected from the possibility of a needle stick. When in the safety stage <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the needle now contaminated cannot stick or cause injury to medical or other persons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The remaining figures, FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, provide more details of the elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and further assist a person skilled in the art with the necessary details to build the blood collection safety device of the present invention. The inventor has provided an embodiment that would allow a person skilled in the art to build, fabricate or make the blood collection safety device. However the inventor believes those making some variation in the invention, such as for example, having different locking arrangements, changing shapes of seals, using different materials and making other non-substantial changes would be practicing the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> First the distal end of seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is inserted into the proximal opening of syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The user then pushes or urges the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the distal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> goes forward the lock tab <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of seal assembly pushes the needle assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> down the barrel (the cavity) of the syringe body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until the distal end of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fully extruded from the opening at the distal tapered end of the syringe body. During this operation, step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the proximal end of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> penetrates the flat seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> placing the proximal end of the needle in the space between the flat seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the distal end of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted into a vein and when a positive blood flow is detected at the proximal lumen of needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is moved farther distally until there is an irreversible engagement with the lock groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the needle carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the lock tab <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At this stage the proximal lumen of needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> partially penetrates the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and causing (by blocking) blood flow to cease. The distal locking twist tab <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is reversibly engaged (bayonet type locking mechanism) with proximal lock channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the syringe top <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the distal end of a standard vacutainer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (collection tube) is then inserted into the proximal opening of seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and moved in a distal direction until the distal seal of the vacutainer contacts the proximal aspect of the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the occluding seal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Additional distal pressure on the vacutainer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> compresses the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> exposing the proximal end of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and causing the proximal end of needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to penetrate the distal end of vacutainer seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the vacutainer. Blood flow now resumes (it was earlier blocked) at this point and blood collects within the cavity of the vacutainer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When sufficient (the desired amount) blood has been collected in the vacutainer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the filled vacutainer is removed, step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, from the combined seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Concomitantly, the conical seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> decompresses (spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> expands) and moves proximally to again occlude blood flow from the lumen of the proximal end of the needle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If more blood is needed, step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (optional), additional vacutainers are used by repeating steps <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When the blood collection procedure has been completed, and while the needle remains in the vein, the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disengaged (it was earlier reversibly engaged) from the syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by rotating the bayonet type locking mechanism and withdrawing the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a proximal direction, step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The needle assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, being irreversibly locked with the locking tabs <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the seal assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is concomitantly and safely withdrawn into the cavity of syringe body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This action removes the needle from the target tissue without the contaminated needle being exposed to the health care provider. The distal insertable edge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the syringe top <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, prevents the needle carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from being withdrawn from the syringe assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereby further enhancing the safety of this blood collection device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> All such modifications and variations of the embodiments of the blood collection device are intended to be included herein and are within the scope of this disclosure that is protected by the following claims:</paragraph>
