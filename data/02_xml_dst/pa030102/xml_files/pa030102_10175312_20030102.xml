<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A torque shearing nut system and method incorporating a hybrid &ldquo;twistnut&rdquo; constructed of a metallic force bearing member and a thermoplastic rubber (Vyram&reg;, etc.) and/or plastic (polyamide (nylon), polypropylene (PP), etc.) surrounding support member is disclosed. The present invention permits the use of one or more steel washer inserts formed to permit shearing of an external axial element for the purposes of ensuring the application of a predefined torque to the external axial member. The primary advantage of the present invention is one of cost, in that the present invention can be manufactured using stamped steel washers that are surrounded with and impregnated with molded thermoplastic rubber (Vyram&reg;, etc.) and/or plastic (polyamide (nylon), polypropylene (PP), etc.). This encapsulation process is significantly less expensive than traditional hot-forging methodologies used to manufacture prior art twistnuts and the like. Furthermore, the present invention permits a reduction in the complexity of steps required to both manufacture the twistnuts as well as combine them with the external axial member. The present invention may be manufactured without the need for specialized hot forge tooling and hot forge machinery, and as such the production volume limitations of the prior art are not present in the manufacture of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0100</bold></highlight>), the present invention is related directly to construction techniques that incorporate &ldquo;twistnuts&rdquo; (twist-off bolts and/or nuts) (<highlight><bold>0101</bold></highlight>) which are specifically constructed to permit mechanical assembly of various materials with a known certainty given specific fasteners and a known fastening torque. These systems generally incorporate a twistnut assembly (<highlight><bold>0101</bold></highlight>) that is twisted off of another rod-member (<highlight><bold>0102</bold></highlight>) via the use of some torque-application device (<highlight><bold>0103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Generally, the present invention deals specifically with improvements in the twist-off nut that may be used to properly torque an axial element (screw, threaded rod, etc.) (<highlight><bold>0102</bold></highlight>). The fabrication of these twist-off nuts generally requires the use of a Hatebur (or equivalent) hot forging press, an expensive and time consuming process that has both cost and throughput drawbacks in high-volume production environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is particularly amenable to applications in which twistnuts and the like are to be directly replaced by a more cost-effective solution, the present invention also provides some benefits over the prior art that extend beyond mere cost and volume production issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has a wide scope of applicability, it is particularly amenable to situations as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0100</bold></highlight>) in which a twist-off nut (<highlight><bold>0101</bold></highlight>) is used to cinch or tighten a retaining gland (<highlight><bold>0104</bold></highlight>) used to mate various types of pipe (cast iron, PVC, etc.) via the use of a retaining member (<highlight><bold>0105</bold></highlight>). Such exemplary applications are detailed generally in U.S. Pat. No. 4,092,036 for PIPE JUNCTION HOLDER issued May 30, 1978 to Toshiyuki Sato and Hideo Edo, and initially assigned to Kabushiki Kaisha Suiken of Osaka, Japan and U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,112 for PIPE JOINT RESTRAINER GLANDS issued Feb. 4, 1986 to Earl C. Bradley, Jr., Jack Burkholder, Earl F. Bullock and assigned to EBBA &lsqb;sic&rsqb; Iron Inc. of Eastland, Tex., USA. Specifically, the present invention provides an improved methodology of implementing torque bolt-nut assemblies as generally illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,774 for LIMITING TORQUE BOLT-NUT ASSEMBLY issued Dec. 9, 1986 to Earl T. Bradley, and assigned to EBAA Iron Inc. of Eastland, Tex., USA. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Bolting Methods </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There are four and only four methods allowed to measure whether structural bolts are correctly installed. They include the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Calibrated Wrench </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> This method is sometimes known erroneously as &ldquo;torque control&rdquo;. The Research Council stipulates that each day, for each different diameter, length, and grade of bolts, a representative sample of three bolts must be selected to calibrate a wrench. (By &ldquo;representative sample&rdquo; they mean bolts in the same condition as the ones that are about to be tightened.) The bolts are tensioned in a Skidmore-Wilhelm bolt tension calibrator on the site to measure (i.e., &ldquo;calibrate&rdquo;) how much torque it takes to get the bolts up to the correct tension. (That is, to a tension 5% higher than the specified minimum.) The wrench is then set to cut out at that torque (the wrench becomes &ldquo;calibrated&rdquo;), and then all similar bolts that day are installed to that torque after the joint is snugged first. Rotation during the tightening process must be limited to a specific value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> On the next day another set of torques is similarly established and the wrench(s) calibrated again. And so on. Tables of torque by bolt size and diameter are not applicable, and this entire method is not allowed in Canada. Actual results of tension in bolts produced by this method are acknowledged to be highly variable, even when this method is followed religiously, which is rarely the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Direct Tension Indicator (DTI) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> DTI&apos;s are like little individual weigh scales, which measure the bolt tension developed during tightening, regardless of the torque resistance of the bolt. By far the simplest method, a DTI is put on one or the other end of all bolts, and after snugging the joint by partially (but not fully) compressing the DTI, all the DTI&apos;s are &ldquo;crushed&rdquo; to the point where a feeler gage cannot be inserted half way around. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> DTI&apos;s are completely independent of the torque resistance of the bolt assembly, and because the compression of the DTI bumps can be seen by the eye, even without a feeler gage, bolt installers tend NOT to leave the bolts with insufficiently compressed DTI&apos;s. Inspection by using a feeler gage (on a sample of the bolts only) can be done by anyone at any time. If the DTI is put on the nut end of the bolt, tightening can be done by one person because it is not necessary to hold the bolt roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Turn-of-Nut&rdquo; or &ldquo;Part Turn&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> After snugging the joint, the bolt shank and nut is marked and then a specific amount of rotation is induced between the nut and the bolt. The amount of rotation differs for different bolt lengths and diameters and therefore must be known and understood by the bolt installers in advance. The success of the method is dependent on a correct snugging of the joint, and is dependent on the bolt head being held from turning so the bolt does not spin in the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Two persons are therefore MANDATORY to execute this method correctly&mdash;one to hold the bolt from turning or &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; and the other person to operate the wrench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Note that turn-of-nut does not work correctly when the steel surfaces are coated with a compressible coating such as high paint thickness or hot dipped galvanized zinc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Twist-Off Bolts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This method usually defaults to &ldquo;twist-off&rdquo; bolts, sometimes called &ldquo;tension-control&rdquo; bolts. These assemblies function by calibrating the torque needed to twist off a splined extension manufactured into the bolt shank. Made correctly, the &ldquo;twist-off&rdquo; will occur at a bolt tension above the minimum required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The main advantage of &ldquo;twist-off&rdquo; bolts is that they can be tightened from one side by one person, although bolt installers now realize that regular hex bolts and DTI&apos;s can also be installed one-side, one-man, too. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When used correctly, all four tensioning methods will produce correctly tensioned bolts, but all four methods differ in complexity and effectiveness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Current Prior Art Manufacturing Process </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention deals primarily with twist-off (&ldquo;twistoff&rdquo;) fasteners as described generally above. The current manufacturing process for the twistoff nuts used in this construction technique is as follows. Raw material is purchased as round steel barstock in full lengths. The steel barstock is placed on a special rack so that it can be sorted to single pieces. The single pieces are then fed by rollers into a hot forging machine. The first step is to pass the steel barstock through an induction coil that heats the barstock red-hot. The next series of steps shears off a length of the barstock, forges impressions into and shapes the red-hot piece, and then pierces a hole through the top of the forged piece in its axial direction. The piece is still red-hot as it is conveyed away from the hot forging press. The hot-forged pieces are now referred to as &ldquo;twistnuts.&rdquo; The twistnuts are allowed to air-cool in large metal totes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The specific purpose of these &ldquo;twistnuts&rdquo; is to shear off specially designed axial torque limiting members (&ldquo;tangs&rdquo;) on the top of casted iron bolts and therefore limit the amount of torque that can be applied to the bolt by the shear-failure of the tangs. While this &ldquo;breakaway-bolt&rdquo; or &ldquo;twist-off&rdquo; bolt technique has a wide range of applicability, it has significant application in the area of mechanical joint restraint systems that apply direct pressure to ductile cast iron and/or PVC pipe. In these circumstances it is critical to ensure that maximum torque levels are not exceeded so as to prevent possible damage to the pipe during installation. It is equally important to meet or exceed minimum torque requirements in this application to prevent restraint failure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Contrast to Present Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Within the context of the present invention, the steel twistnuts are replaced by an injection molded plastic nut that has one or more steel washer inserts. These washer(s) are stamped to a specific shape and dimension then placed in the mold immediately prior to the closing of the mold-in cycle. The washer is then substantially encapsulated in the plastic nut. The bottom of the washer is situated so that is in-line with the required &ldquo;shear-plane&rdquo; of the tangs (axial torque limiting members). The inside perimeter of the twistnut is the bearing surface required to shear the tangs. The outside perimeter of the washer/nut assembly are the main torque transfer points exerted by a socket wrench (or other torque generating device) used to turn the nut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A major contrasting feature of many preferred embodiments of the present invention is the ability to eliminate a required and expensive manufacturing step in the assembly of the twistnut with the axial torque limiting member (&ldquo;tang&rdquo;) that is sheared off during field application. Normally, the twistnut is placed over the axial torque limiting member with the axial member protruding through the top of the twistnut. This protruding piece of the axial member is then rolled/flanged/mushroomed to force an impassable friction fit between the twistnut and the axial member. This friction fit assembly method is expensive to implement. In contrast, the present invention utilizes a press fit between the plastic support member encapsulant and the axial member. This is a cold-flow retaining mechanism. The plastic will maintain protection of the washer and the &ldquo;nut&rdquo; form, as well as include non-threaded retaining qualities to hold the twistnut in place during the transport and field application processes. The plastic also has the property in this application to hold the washer in the correct shear plane. In addition, the present invention also permits the twistnut to contain an impregnated/surface fastener to permit retention of the axial member as a substitute for or in addition to any press-fit that exists between the twistnut and the axial member. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">System Overview </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the present invention is to provide a method of implementing twist-off bolt connections without the need for forged twistoff nuts. The system as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generally consists of the following elements: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> (a) a force bearing member having a central torque applicator and a plethora of injection inserts; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> (b) a support member encapsulating the force bearing member and impregnating the injection inserts; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> This basic system is constrained by the following criterion: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> the torque application means permits rotation of an external axial member via the torque applicator and shearing of the member at a predefined torque value; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> the support member has an external perimeter with a plethora of paired parallel surfaces that permit application of torque to the support member; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> the impregnation of the injection inserts by the support member permits transfer of torque from the paired parallel surfaces to the central torque applicator. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Fabrication Method Overview (<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention teaches a general methodology to fabricate a twistoff nut comprising the following basic steps as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> (1) stamping a force bearing member having a central torque application and a plethora of injection inserts (<highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> (2) encapsulating the force bearing member and impregnating the injection inserts to form a support member (<highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (3) ejecting the torque shearing nut assembly from the injection mold (<highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (4) repeating steps (1)-(3) for each torque shearing nut assembly (<highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> These basic steps mechanically link the force bearing member to the support member so as to form an integral twistoff nut system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Preferred Application Environment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> One preferred commercial application for the present invention is in the construction and installation of restraint harnesses for ductile iron pipe bells. In this application (typically utilizing Megalug&reg; brand or equivalent restraint harnesses), the present invention is specifically designed to directly replace the twistoff nut that is used to perform proper torque management of restraining ring fasteners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Here the application demands that a restraining ring or gland be fitted to ductile cast iron pipe or PVC pipe. To prevent crushing or damage to the cast iron/PVC pipe, the use of some form of torque limiting in this application is mandatory. Typically a twistoff nut assembly that is manufactured with a Hatebur (or equivalent) hot forging machine is used for this purpose. This twistoff nut contains an outer surface that typically mates to a socket wrench or other torque generating device to permit torque transfer to the axial member on which the twistoff nut encompasses. The present invention is designed to be a direct replacement for these twistoff nuts, but at a significantly reduced price, lower cost of manufacture, lower cost of shipping, and reduce number and complexity of manufacturing steps.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detailed preferred embodiment of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiment illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the presently preferred embodiment, wherein these innovative teachings are advantageously applied to the particular problems of a TORQUE SHEARING NUT SYSTEM AND METHOD. However, it should be understood that this embodiment is only one example of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily limit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">System Overview (<highlight><bold>0100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0400</bold></highlight>) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referencing the prior art illustration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0100</bold></highlight>), the present invention application environment, while broad, has specific application in situations where twistoff nuts and the like are torqued to minimum torque values in the field. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0101</bold></highlight>), the present invention twistnut technique generally begins with a twistnut assembly (<highlight><bold>0101</bold></highlight>) that is then torqued with a wrench (<highlight><bold>0103</bold></highlight>) or other implement to a specified torque level, at which point the twistnut (<highlight><bold>0101</bold></highlight>) detaches from an external axial member (<highlight><bold>0102</bold></highlight>), leaving the external axial member (<highlight><bold>0102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The exemplary system application illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0100</bold></highlight>) is generally termed a &ldquo;restraining flange adapter&rdquo; system, typically sold under brand names such as MEGAFLANGE&reg; and the like. A detail of this system application is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0200</bold></highlight>) wherein the twistnut is illustrated attached to the external axial member (also termed a &ldquo;torque-limiting actuating screw&rdquo; or the like). While the terminologies may vary, the purpose of the twistnut is to permit torque application to the external axial member until a portion of the member mechanically fails, permitting verification of proper torque to the connection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Generally, the prior art utilizes a casted collar bolt that is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0300</bold></highlight>) (for S-Tangs) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0400</bold></highlight>) (for Obround-Tangs). These exemplary collar bolt diagrams may be used within the context of the present invention to generate a plastic mold that conforms to the twistnut dimensions typically used by the prior art. The key difference in the present invention is that this new support structure may be constructed of plastic or some other low-cost material rather than requiring hot-forging as in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Given that this new support material may not have the strength of existing forged twistnuts, a metallic or other hard insert is placed inside the support material. This hard insert is substantially encapsulated by the support material and provides the mechanical strength to permit torque application to the external axial member as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Exemplary System Embodiment (<highlight><bold>0500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0600</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0700</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0800</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be embodied in many forms, but one preferred embodiment style is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>0500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0600</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0700</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0800</bold></highlight>) which illustrate a side view of the hybrid twistnut assembly (<highlight><bold>0500</bold></highlight>), a detailed side view illustrating an exemplary washer insert (<highlight><bold>0600</bold></highlight>), a detailed end view of the assembled twistnut (<highlight><bold>0700</bold></highlight>), and a detailed end/side view of the exemplary washer insert (<highlight><bold>0800</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It is significant to note that there are a wide variety of variations in construction of the washer insert that are possible in these configurations. Here the washer insert is illustrated as having a plethora of semi-circular injection inserts (<highlight><bold>0801</bold></highlight>) which permit plastic or other encapsulant to surround and mate to the washer insert. Additionally, one or more tabs (<highlight><bold>0602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0802</bold></highlight>) may be formed in the washer insert to permit greater adhesion and contact with the support material (i.e., plastic, etc.). This may permit greater torque transfer from the support material (i.e., plastic, etc.) to the torque bearing washer insert. These tabs (<highlight><bold>0602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0802</bold></highlight>) are normally formed perpendicular to the plane of the washer insert, but this is not critical. While the tabs may be oriented in either perpendicular direction, in some embodiments they may be omitted completely. Furthermore, the tabs (<highlight><bold>0602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0802</bold></highlight>) may be oriented in any direction, not necessarily one that is perpendicular to the washer plane. Note that these tabs (<highlight><bold>0602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0802</bold></highlight>) are optional and may not be present in all embodiments. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> It is significant to note that there are a wide variety of variations in construction of the washer insert that are possible in these configurations. In these illustrated embodiments the washer insert is illustrated as having a plethora of rectangular injection inserts (<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>) which permit plastic or other encapsulant to surround and mate to the washer insert. Additionally, one or more tabs (<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>) may be formed in the washer insert to permit greater adhesion and contact with the support material (i.e., plastic, etc.). This may permit greater torque transfer from the support material (i.e., plastic, etc.) to the torque bearing washer insert. These tabs (<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>) are normally formed perpendicular to the plane of the washer insert, but this is not critical. Furthermore, the tabs (<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>) may be oriented in any direction, not necessarily one that is perpendicular to the washer plane. Note that these tabs (<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>) are optional and may not be present in all embodiments. The dimension and radii of these optional tabs is generally as allowed by the material used for the washer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preferred Exemplary System Embodiments </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Several preferred exemplary system embodiments are possible, with the variations in these embodiments taking the form of variations in the selection and construction of the force bearing member means, central torque application means and/or the support member means. These preferred system variations will now be considered in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Washer Material Variations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> While mild steel may be a suitable material for the force bearing member/central torque application means, the following materials may also be more optimal in some system configurations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> one or more washers using grade 50-100 high strength/low alloy (HSLA) steel (depending on the desired maximum torque value required); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> one or more washers using carbon steel heat treated (e.g., 1050 carbon steel) to a tensile strength as needed for the application (this material may have a tensile strength on the order of 150,000 PSI or greater); or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> one or more washers using an ultra-high strength steel such as MartINsite&reg; steel (manufactured by Inland Steel) or an equivalent (this material may have a tensile strength on the order of 190,000 PSI). MartINsite&reg; is an ultra-high strength, fracture tough, cold rolled sheet steel produced as a low carbon alloy free material. While traditional high strength products develop strength from alloying elements, MartINsite&reg;&apos;s strength is produced by extremely fast water quenching from an elevated austenitic temperature range which results in an autotempered &ldquo;martensitic&rdquo; structure. MartINsite &apos;s ultra-high strength allows the use of reduced gauges and lighter sections when compared to regular carbon steels. Considerable savings in material and processing costs can be realized over high alloy or spring steels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> While the MartINsite steel would seem to have a significant advantage in this application and therefore be preferable, all options mentioned (and their functional equivalents) would also be suitable in this application. In some preferred embodiments, the M190 grade of MartINsite may be optimal given its cost, thickness, and material properties. Note that MartINsite&reg; may in many applications be replaced by an equivalent ultra-high strength steel (UHSS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Note that while heat treated carbon steel (e.g., 1050 carbon steel) is a preferred system embodiment, other heat treatable steels may also be suitable in many applications. One suitable variation of this configuration is a SAE/ANSI 1050 washer having a Rockwell hardness number of 39 on the c-scale (Rc 39) and a tensile strength of 210,000 PSI. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When extreme physical and/or rough handling of the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut is anticipated, a &ldquo;Tonsil-Washer&rdquo; insert (generally constructed of steel) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>) may be utilized to ensure that the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut cannot be accidentally knocked off or pulled off.

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The use of tonsils (<highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>) permit gripping of Obround-Tangs (<highlight><bold>1311</bold></highlight>) while the use of end-corner extensions (<highlight><bold>1422</bold></highlight>) permits gripping of S-Tangs (<highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight>) when used in conjunction with the tonsil washer end corners (<highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>). A unique feature of the washer embodiments illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>) is the ability to grip both Obround-Tangs and S-Tangs with a single washer, permitting the use of a single twistnut assembly for both types of shaft tangs. This ability to permit gripping of both S-Tangs (<highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight>) and Obround-Tangs (<highlight><bold>1311</bold></highlight>) with the same structure is not present within the prior art. More detail of exemplary S-Tang (<highlight><bold>0310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0320</bold></highlight>) and Obround-Tang (<highlight><bold>0410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0420</bold></highlight>) structures is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0300</bold></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0400</bold></highlight>) respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Obround-Tang Tonsil Washer Action (<highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Non-threaded fastening to the Obround-Tang (<highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>) is accomplished by the bottom or &ldquo;end&rdquo; of each &ldquo;tonsil,&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>) on a steel &ldquo;Tonsil-Washer,&rdquo; insert, located opposite of one another, having an interference fit with the Obround-Tang. When the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut is pressed onto the tang (<highlight><bold>1311</bold></highlight>), the tonsils (<highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>) tend to give way to the tang and bite into the tang having enough memory inherent in the steel to maintain a constant and sure fastening. The bottoms of the small protrusions located immediately adjacent to the ends of the tonsils are centering-devices, as they hold the Obround-Tang in the center of the steel &ldquo;Tonsil-Washer&rdquo; insert ensuring a relatively even bite of the tonsils on the tang. The more pressure that is applied to pull the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut off of the Obround-Tang, the more the tonsils bite into the tang. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> S-Tang Tonsil Washer Action (<highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Non-threaded fastening to the S-Tang (<highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>) is accomplished in much the same principal as the Obround-Tang. However, in the case of the S-Tang, the bottom corners or &ldquo;end-corners&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>1422</bold></highlight>) of each &ldquo;tonsil&rdquo; on a steel &ldquo;Tonsil-Washer&rdquo; insert, located diagonally opposite of one another, have an interference fit with the clockwise face of the &ldquo;S&rdquo; on the S-Tang (<highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight>) (keeping in mind that the &ldquo;S&rdquo; on the S-Tang is actually a backwards &ldquo;S&rdquo;) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The faces of the small protrusions located immediately adjacent to the ends of the tonsils are bearing surfaces for the counterclockwise side of the &ldquo;S&rdquo;. As the end-corners of the tonsils bite into the clockwise side of the &ldquo;S&rdquo;, the &ldquo;S&rdquo; is forced against the faces of the protrusions and hence, become a bearing surface. The faces of the protrusions have the same radius as the counterclockwise face of the &ldquo;S&rdquo;. Without the protrusions, the tips or &ldquo;points&rdquo; on either ends of the &ldquo;S&rdquo; is merely peeled off during the press-on stage of assembly to the collarbolt. This peeling-action alleviates the interference fit and prevents the tonsils from biting securely enough for extreme, rough handling. With the protrusions in place, the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut is pressed onto the S-Tang (<highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight>). The tonsil end-corners tend to give way to the tang and bite into the tang having enough memory inherent in the steel to maintain a constant and sure fastening. The more pressure applied to pull the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut off of the S-Tang, the more the tonsils bite into the tang. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Collarbolt Assembly Locating Feature </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When assembling the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut to the collarbolt, a quick directional locating feature may be necessary to make assembly fast and, hence, low cost. When the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut is placed on top of the collarbolt nib, the round column on top of the tang, the nib stabs immediately past the steel washer inserts and into a clearance, in-set region just above the steel washer inserts. The in-set is just deep enough to allow the top of the tang to locate within the inside perimeter of the bottom steel washer insert or just the bottom of the steel washer insert in a single insert Plastic Torque Shearing Nut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Euro-Design on Top of the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut (<highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be constructed using a large radius edge chamfer as illustrated in the exemplary embodiments in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>). The large radius around the top perimeter edge of the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut is not just for appearance. This allows for a greater non-deforming impact surface. When the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut is subjected to large impact forces around the top perimeter, the plastic tends to want to flow instead of break. With the large radius, the impact tends to just lessen (or flatten) the radius rather than flow. Whereas with a small radius around the top perimeter of the Plastic Torque Shearing Nut, the plastic can flow beyond the outside perimeter of the nut hindering the ready placement a socket wrench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Multiple Washer Configuration Variations (<highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Note that in the above variations it is explicitly mentioned that the washer configurations while depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as single washer/plates (<highlight><bold>0800</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>) may also be constructed of multiple washer/plates stamped out of material as detailed within this disclosure. This approach may be used with any of the system configurations mentioned herein. An exemplary embodiment of this variant is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Reasons for this construction approach may vary. For example, the material used may only be readily available in thin stock (e.g., 0.058-inch thick) and the application may require a tensile strength requiring stacking of the washer material for proper function of the system. Additionally, issues regarding the feasibility of stamping thick washer members may also dictate the use of multiple washer/plate members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Finally, in some preferred embodiments one of the washers may serve as an alignment guide for the torque-bearing shaft while another washer may be used to grip the shaft using a press-fit or tonsil-type deformation of the washer. This multi-level construction permits rapid assembly while providing secure fastening of the twistnut assembly to the torque-bearing shaft tang and simultaneously may provide the capability of fastening to Obround-Tang and/or S-Tang shaft tang configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Washer Tab Configuration Variations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> While the washer configurations depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> indicate perpendicular tabs (<highlight><bold>0602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>0802</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>) to aid in the transfer of torque from the outer parallel surfaces of the washer to the central torque application means, there is no requirement that these perpendicular tabs be present for proper operation of the invention in many preferred embodiments. The use of these perpendicular tabs will be highly dependent on the system application and the material used for the support member means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Support Member Means Variations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The present invention is particularly amenable to the use of various plastics as the primary material for use in the support member means. Some exemplary variations for use with the support member means will now be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Thermoplastic Rubber (Vyram&reg;) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Various types of thermoplastic rubber well known to those skilled in the art are suitable for this application. One particularly suitable thermoplastic for some preferred embodiments is Vyram&reg;, available from Advanced Elastomer Systems, L.P., 388 S. Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44311, tel 330-849-5000. Specifically, the use of Vyram&reg; 9103-45 is anticipated in this application by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> This particular type of thermoplastic rubber is temperature and oil resistant and is as good as or better than mid-to-lower-end EPDM, SBR and natural rubber. Vyram&reg; 9000 rubber provides properties that are superior to those of the thermoplastic olefins (TPOs) which have little or no crosslinking (vulcanization) of their rubber phases. Both Vyram&reg; and Santoprene&reg; rubbers are good candidates for replacing EPDM and neoprene (polychloroprene) thermoset rubbers, with Vyram&reg; rubber being the cost effective candidate when replacing SBR and low-end EPDM thermoset compounds. Vyram&reg; rubber can be considered in applications where styrenic thermoplastic materials such as SBS and SEBS are being used or are being considered for use. Vyram&reg; rubber can often meet or improve the balance of cost and performance in these applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> One of the major economic advantages of Vyram&reg; 9000 rubber over thermoset rubber is its recyclability; clean regrind can be used multiple times without significantly affecting its properties. When used with the present invention, this particular type of rubber product may reduce waste products normally associated with twistoff nuts and the like by permitting recycling of the twistoff nut itself. While initial cost of Vyram&reg; 9103-45 is in the range of US$1.49/lb versus US$0.042/lb for polypropylene (resulting in an overall cost differential of approximately US$0.035 per twistoff nut assembly in an exemplary application), this initial cost differential may be offset by the ability to readily recycle the Vyram&reg; material from the twistoff nut that is normally scrapped once the torque shearing operation is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Polyamides (Nylon) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Various types of high-strength polyamides (nylon) well known to those skilled in the art are suitable for this application. Polyamides are available in a variety of grades, including general-purpose, which can be unreinforced or reinforced; impact-modified grades, unreinforced or reinforced, but with superior impact resistance; and reduced moisture grades, available as glass- and/or mineral-reinforced or both reinforced and impact modified. There are also flame-retardant grades and grades for medical devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Polypropylene (PP) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the use of plastics such as polypropylene (PP) and its variant forms are suitable for this application. Polypropylene has a range of molecular weights, copolymers, blends, alloys, and filled or reinforced polymers. The homopolymer form of PP is the most frequently used since it is ideal for a wide range of activities due to its high heat resistance, tensile strength and good rigidity. Homopolymers compounded with fiberglass, calcium carbonate, talc, and other mineral fibers can provide cost effective, lower density materials for certain injection molding applications; they are available with a filler loading from 10 to 40%. Significant increases in heat distortion, tensile strength, and modulus can be obtained with glass-filled, talc-filled, and, to a lesser amount, with calcium carbonate-filled systems. Random copolymers and heterophasic copolymers have also been developed to further broaden the spectrum of the use of polypropylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> With respect to a preferred system embodiment, polypropylene may have a significant cost advantage over the use of nylon. For example, a typical cost for nylon might be US$1.30/lb, whereas the cost for polypropylene might be only US$0.40/lb (and range as low as US$0.25/lb), yielding an effective cost savings of 3&times; to 4&times; of polypropylene over nylon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Finally, the use of plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and its variant forms are suitable for this application. There are three basic types of polyethylene (PE) resins: low-density PE (LDPE), linear low-density PE (LDPE), and high-density PE (HDPE). HDPE has advantages in this application due to its light weight, excellent chemical resistance, ease of processing, and relatively low cost. One skilled in the art will be familiar with the many variations of HDPE and their applicability to the present invention given the teachings presented in this document. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">System Variations </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The present invention anticipates a wide variety of variations in the basic theme of construction, including but not limited to the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The use of plastic for the support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The use of a fastener at the end of the external axial member to retain the axial member to the support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The use of a press-fit between the external axial member and the support member to connect these two elements prior to and during the torque application process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The use of semi-circular and/or rectangular injection inserts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The use of holes in the force bearing member as injection inserts. These may be drilled, punched, or otherwise formed as one skilled in the art will readily recognize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The use of a washer as the force bearing member in the support structure, as well as the use of steel and other materials for this washer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The use of hexagonal, square, Torx&reg; (a type of spline), spline, and other polygonal and/or radial shapes to form the support structure. Generally any structure that permits torque application is amenable to use with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The use of a central torque application means having parallel sides connected to semi-circular ends, as well as the use of rectangular shapes for this structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The use of a central torque application means having sides in the form of a regular polygon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The use of tabs (perpendicular to the plane of the washer insert or otherwise) to aid in the transfer of torque from the support member to the central torque application means.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Restraining Gland Application </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The present invention specifically anticipates the use of the present invention in the context of pipe restraining glands as detailed generally in U.S. Pat. No. 4,092,036 for PIPE JUNCTION HOLDER issued May 30, 1978 to Toshiyuki Sato and Hideo Edo, and initially assigned to Kabushiki Kaisha Suiken of Osaka, Japan and U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,112 for PIPE JOINT RESTRAINER GLANDS issued Feb. 4, 1986 to Earl C. Bradley, Jr., Jack Burkholder, Earl F. Bullock and assigned to EBBA &lsqb;sic&rsqb; Iron Inc. of Eastland, Tex., USA. Specifically, the present invention anticipates that torque bolt-nut assemblies used in these applications will be dramatically improved by using the teachings of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> A general example of this type of torque bolt-nut assembly is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,774 for LIMITING TORQUE BOLT-NUT ASSEMBLY issued Dec. 9, 1986 to Earl T. Bradley, and assigned to EBAA Iron Inc. of Eastland, Tex., USA. In this example, the protective nut (7) illustrated in this patent (FIG. 1, callout 7, of U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,774) is replaced by the present invention with a corresponding significant reduction in overall product cost and increase in product functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Thus, one embodiment of the present invention anticipates the incorporation of the torque shearing nut described herein with a limiting torque bolt-nut assembly used in conjunction within the context of a pipe joint restrainer gland system. The resulting system has lower weight, lower manufacturing cost, increased ease of production, and permits recycling of materials in a way not possible with the prior art. Additionally, the elimination of forging in the manufacturing process drastically decreases the amount of electrical energy required to produce the resulting restraining gland system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Method Overview (<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The general method taught by the present invention deals specifically with a manufacturing method associated with making twistnuts from hybrid materials in order to reduce overall product costs for this device. This starts by replacing the conventional twistnut hot-forging process with an injection molding process (<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>) in which a metal washer or other hard insert is used to replace the torque-bearing elements of the twistnut as implemented in the prior art. The general methodology of fabrication is illustrated by the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>) and has been described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Significant to this method is the use of metal stamping or some other inexpensive process to form the torque-bearing member of the twistnut. This is followed by the use of injection molding with any variety of hard plastics (polyamides (nylon), polypropylene (PP), etc.) that can withstand the harsh environment of transport as well as resiliently hold the form of a hexagonal nut or other form while being torqued as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (<highlight><bold>0102</bold></highlight>) within a field application. While a wide variety of plastics is suitable for this application, a variety of polyamide and polypropylene based products may prove particularly useful in many applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> A torque shearing nut system and method incorporating a hybrid &ldquo;twistnut&rdquo; constructed of a metallic force bearing member and a thermoplastic rubber (Vyram&reg;, etc.) and/or plastic (polyamide (nylon), polypropylene (PP), etc.) surrounding support member has been disclosed. The present invention permits the use of one or more steel washer inserts formed to permit shearing of an external axial element for the purposes of ensuring the application of a predefined torque to the external axial member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The primary advantage of the present invention is one of cost, in that the present invention can be manufactured using stamped steel washers that are surrounded with and impregnated with molded thermoplastic rubber (Vyram&reg;, etc.) and/or plastic (polyamide (nylon), polypropylene (PP), etc.). This encapsulation process is significantly less expensive than traditional hot-forging methodologies used to manufacture prior art twistnuts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention permits a reduction in the complexity of manufacturing steps required to both manufacture the twistnuts as well as combine them with the external axial member. Note that an additional feature of the present invention is that it may be manufactured without the need for specialized hot forge tooling and hot forge machinery, and as such the production volume limitations of the prior art are not present in the manufacture of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Finally, the present invention permits new formulations of limiting torque bolt-nut assemblies to be incorporated within pipe joint restrainer glands and pipe junction holders. These new formulations are highly cost reduced, lower in weight, recyclable, and require substantially reduced amounts of energy to both manufacture and transport as compared to prior art solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing detailed description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims:</paragraph>
