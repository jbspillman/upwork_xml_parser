<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of communications systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to communication systems in which electronic information is transmitted in packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Communications systems maybe subject to intermittent, random bursts of noise, often referred to as burst noise or impulse noise. This burst noise can result in the introduction of errors into the electronic information transmitted over the communications system. For example, in a communications system in which voice, data and/or other electronic information is transmitted in packets, the presence of burst noise can cause packets to become corrupted. Packet errors must be detected in order for a communications system to operate reliably. Where packet errors are detected but cannot be corrected, bad packets must be dropped and re-transmitted, resulting in a net loss of transmission speed and network bandwidth. If the dropped packets include voice information, the result may be a loss in overall quality of service (QOS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some communications systems utilize Forward Error Correction (FEC) and/or interleaving in order to control errors in transmitted data resulting from burst noise. FEC involves the addition of extra information to data before it is transmitted, which is then used by the receiver to detect errors and correct the data when necessary. Depending on the FEC algorithm used, the receiver can detect and correct fewer than a predetermined number of errors per packet. Different types of FEC methods include block codes, cyclic codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and convolutional codes. Interleaving involves rearranging data to be transmitted according to a mapping and then returning the data to its original order at the receiver. Interleaving serves to spread the effects of burst noise over multiple packets, thereby decreasing the average number of errors per packet. This, in turn, enhances the ability of FEC to detect and correct errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For example, in a conventional cable modem system operating in accordance with DOCSIS (Data Over Cable System Interface Specification), the upstream physical (PHY) layer utilizes a combination of Reed-Solomon coding and interleaving to control errors. These methods allow an upstream receiver to correct errors resulting from burst noise of a certain duration and frequency of occurrence. However, there may be extreme cases where the burst noise is so severe that more errors are introduced into a packet than these combined methods can detect and correct. In these instances, packets will be lost. Therefore, what is needed is a technique for detecting and correcting packet errors in cases where burst noise is more severe than can be handled by conventional PHY technology. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the above problems by providing novel techniques for preventing the loss of packets due to burst noise in a communications system. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, a transmitting device applies a layer of coding, which may be termed an &ldquo;outer code,&rdquo; to one or more packets prior to transmitting the packets over a communication channel. The outer coding of the packets enables a receiving device to restore packets corrupted by burst noise in instances where the packet errors could not otherwise be corrected by conventional PHY layer Forward Error Correction (FEC) and interleaving techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a communications system in which data is transmitted in bursts, a severe impairment on the communication channel can cause an entire burst of data to be lost. One way to combat the impairment is to increase the robustness of an individual burst; for example, the amount of parity information in the burst may be substantially increased. However, this approach will negatively impact the data transmission efficiency of the communications system. Moreover, if the impairment is severe enough, the burst may be lost regardless of the increased level of error correction. In contrast, the outer coding techniques of the present invention increase robustness through the transmission of additional bursts (e.g., block-encoded parity packets, repeated packets, or re-transmitted packets), such that burst data may be recovered even in the instance where an entire burst has been lost due to an impairment on the communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Typically, a first aspect of a burst communication system operates to ensure successful transmission of individual bursts of data over the communication channel, while a second aspect assembles data bursts into a stream of data for processing by a higher-level application. Embodiments of the present invention may be advantageously implemented in conjunction with this second aspect to perform outer encoding and decoding. In a DOCSIS system, the first aspect corresponds to the PHY layer, while the second aspect corresponds to the MAC layer. Accordingly, the outer coding and decoding of packets may occur at the MAC layer of the transmitting and receiving devices, which resides just above the PHY layer. For example, the PHY layer of a receiving device may be unable to correct packets which are in error due to burst noise. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, these packets are further processed by an outer code at the MAC layer in order to correct the bad packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the invention the outer code comprises a block code, such as an (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code or an XOR code. A transmitting device applies the block code to one or more packets to generate a plurality of information segments and parity segments, each of which is then transmitted separately over a communication channel to a receiving device. A receiving device receives and collects the information and parity segments and decodes them in accordance with the same block code in order to restore any segments that were lost during transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the outer code is a repetition code in which the same packet is transmitted two or more times from a transmitting device to a receiving device. Provided at least one of the repeated packets survives transmission, the receiving device can recover the original packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a retransmission technique is used to mitigate the effects of burst noise on the communication channel. In accordance with this technique, a receiving device instructs a transmitting device to retransmit a packet which has been lost due to noise on the communication channel. Methods for implementing this technique include sending data acknowledgment messages (ACKS) from the receiving device to the transmitting device every time a packet is received successfully, or by sending data non-acknowledgment messages (NACKs) from the receiving device to the transmitting device when a bad packet is received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention, an FEC block reconstruction technique is used by a receiving device to restore transmitted packets that have been corrupted by burst noise. This technique takes advantage of the fact that packets are often transmitted as a plurality of FEC blocks. In accordance with such a technique, a receiving device receives some but not all of the FEC blocks of a transmitted packet. The receiving device then replaces the bad FEC blocks with good FEC blocks from a repeated packet transmission, if repetition outer coding is used, or by requesting retransmission of the bad FEC blocks or the entire original packet from a transmitting device, if a retransmission technique is used. A combination of repetition coding, retransmission, and FEC block reconstruction may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention provide a means for greatly improving the robustness of a communications system afflicted with occasional, or bursty, extreme impairment levels. A particular advantage of the techniques provided herein is that they may be overlaid, in some cases, onto existing communication systems in the field with only minor upgrade or modification required. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be implemented primarily as a software application running in, or in conjunction with, existing communication devices, such as existing cable modem or cable modem termination system (CMTS) hardware. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide a solution to a PHY level impairment without actually altering the PHY layer of existing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention may also provide for additional robustness above the PHY layer without having to rely on failure mechanisms from higher layers in the network protocol stack, and with a minimum impact on latency. Implementations of the present invention may have no noticeable impact on latency, unlike some Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) schemes. Embodiments of the present invention can provide robustness in cases where ARQ is not feasible, such as voice applications. By providing another level of mitigation against PHY layer impairments, especially a severe time-varying impairment, embodiments of the present invention can optimize the conventional PHY layer for a more normal, non-extreme impairment level. Embodiments of the present invention thus provide superior utilization of a communication channel as compared to a modified, traditional PHY-layer-only solution, which must somehow overcome severe impairments by itself. Finally, techniques in accordance with the present invention can be combined with other techniques, such as packet header suppression (PHS) techniques, to beneficially result in increased robustness and efficiency.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Although the techniques of the present invention may be practiced in any communications system, example embodiments described herein pertain specifically to cable modem systems. Accordingly, an example cable modem system will be described in more detail below. However, the invention is not limited to cable modem systems. Persons skilled in the art based on the teachings provided herein will appreciate that the present invention may be practiced in any communications system in which information is transmitted in packets. For example, embodiments of the present invention may also be implemented in wireless communication systems that transmit information in packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a high-level block diagram of an example cable modem system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which embodiments of the present invention may operate. The example cable modem system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> enables voice communications, video and data services based on a bidirectional transfer of packet-based traffic, such as Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, between a cable system head end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a plurality of cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>over a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) cable network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The cable headend <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is comprised of at least one cable modem termination system (CMTS) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is the portion of the cable headend <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that manages the upstream and downstream transfer of data between the cable headend <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, which are located at the customer premises. The CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> broadcasts information downstream to the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>as a continuous transmitted signal in accordance with a time division multiplexing (TDM) technique. Additionally, the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives data from the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>over a plurality of shared upstream channels. Data from the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>may be transmitted upstream in accordance with a time domain multiple access (TDMA) technique or a synchronous code division multiple access (S-CDMA) technique. In accordance with TDMA, each cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>may only send information upstream as short burst signals during a transmission opportunity allocated to it by the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> further serves as an interface between the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, transferring IP packets received from the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>to the packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and transferring IP packets received from the packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>when appropriate. The packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may include, for example, the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In addition to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the cable headend <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may also include one or more Internet routers to facilitate the connection between the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, as well as one or more servers for performing necessary network management tasks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides a point-to-multipoint topology for the high-speed, reliable, and secure transport of data between the cable headend <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>at the customer premises. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may include coaxial cable, fiberoptic cable, or a combination of coaxial cable and fiberoptic cable linked via one or more fiber nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Each of the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>operates as an interface between the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and at least one attached user device. In particular, the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>convert downstream signals received over the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into IP data packets for receipt by an attached user device. Additionally, the cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>convert IP data packets received from the attached user device into upstream burst signals suitable for transfer over the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the example cable modem system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, each cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>is shown supporting only a single user device for clarity. In general, each cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>is capable of supporting a plurality of user devices for communication over the cable modem system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. User devices may include personal computers, data terminal equipment, telephony devices, broadband media players, network-controlled appliances, or any other device capable of transmitting or receiving data over a packet-switched network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the example cable modem system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>and CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> represent DOCSIS-compliant cable modem equipment. In other words, cable modems <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>and CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicate in accordance with protocols and formats set forth in the DOCSIS specification. The term DOCSIS (Data Over Cable System Interface Specification) generally refers to a group of specifications published by CableLabs that define industry standards for cable headend and cable modem equipment. In part, DOCSIS sets forth requirements and objectives for various aspects of cable modem systems including operations support systems, management, data interfaces, as well as network layer, data link layer, and physical layer transport for data over cable systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> 1. Example Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a schematic block diagram of an implementation of the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of cable modem system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is presented by way of example, and is not intended to limit the present invention. The CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is configured to receive and transmit signals to and from the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a portion of which is represented by the optical fiber <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will be described in terms of a receiver portion and a transmitter portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The receiver portion includes an optical-to-coax stage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, an RF input <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a splitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of burst receivers <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Reception begins with the receipt of upstream burst signals originating from one or more cable modems by the optical-to-coax stage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> via the optical fiber <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The optical-to-coax stage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> routes the received burst signals to the radio frequency (RF) input <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> via coaxial cable <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. These upstream burst signals have spectral characteristics within the frequency range of roughly 5-42 MHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The received signals are provided by the RF input <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to the splitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which separates the RF input signals into N separate channels. Each of the N separate channels is then provided to a separate burst receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> which operates to demodulate the received signals on each channel in accordance with a particular demodulation technique to recover the underlying information signals. The demodulation technique may comprise, without limitation, a Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) technique, an 8-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) technique, a 16-QAM technique, a 32-QAM technique, or a 64-QAM technique. Each burst receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> also converts the underlying information signals from an analog form to digital form. This digital data is subsequently provided to the headend media access control (MAC) <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> operates to process the digital data in accordance with the DOCSIS specification. The functions of the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be implemented in hardware or in software. In the example implementation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the functions of the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are implemented both in hardware and software. Software functions of the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be stored in either the random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or the read-only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The headend MAC is in electrical communication with these elements via a backplane interface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a shared communications medium <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, the shared communications medium <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> may comprise a computer bus or a multiple access data network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is also in electrical communication with the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> via both the backplane interface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the shared communications medium <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. When appropriate, Ethernet packets recovered by the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are transferred to the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for delivery to the packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> via a router. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The transmitter portion of the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a downstream modulator <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, an intermediate frequency (IF) output <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, a radio frequency (RF) upconverter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the optical-to-coax stage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Transmission begins with the generation of a digital broadcast signal by the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The digital broadcast signal may include data originally received from the packet-switched network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> via the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> outputs the digital broadcast signal to the downstream modulator <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> which converts it into an analog form and modulates it onto a carrier signal in accordance with, for example, a 64-QAM or 256-QAM technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The modulated carrier signal output by the downstream modulator <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is input to the SAW filter <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> which passes only spectral components of the signal that are within a desired bandwidth. The filtered signal is then output to an amplifier <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which amplifies it and outputs it to the IF output <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The IF output <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> routes the signal to the RF upconverter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which upconverts the signal. The upconverted signal has spectral characteristics in the frequency range of approximately 54-860 MHz. The upconverted signal is then output to the optical-to-coax stage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> over the coaxial cable <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The optical-to-coax stage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> broadcasts the signal via the optical fiber <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is configured to receive and transmit signals to and from the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via the coaxial connector <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will be described in terms of a receiver portion and a transmitter portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The receiver portion includes a diplex filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an RF tuner <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a SAW filter <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and a downstream receiver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Reception begins with the receipt of a downstream signal originating from the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by the diplex filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The diplex filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> operates to isolate the downstream signal and route it to the RF tuner <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, the downstream signal has spectral characteristics in the frequency range of roughly 54-860 MHz. The RF tuner <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> downconverts the signal and outputs it to the SAW filter <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, which passes only spectral components of the downconverted signal that are within a desired bandwidth. The filtered signal is output to the amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> which amplifies it and passes it to the downstream receiver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Automatic gain controls are provided from the downstream receiver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to the RF tuner <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The downstream receiver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> demodulates the amplified signal in accordance with, for example, either a 64-QAM or 256-QAM technique to recover the underlying information signal. The downstream receiver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> also converts the underlying information signal from an analog form to digital form. This digital data is subsequently provided to the media access control (MAC) <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> processes the digital data, which may include, for example, Ethernet packets for transfer to an attached user device. The functions of the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be implemented in hardware or in software. In the example implementation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the functions of the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are implemented in both hardware and software. Software functions of the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be stored in either the RAM <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> or the ROM <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is in electrical communication with these elements via a shared communications medium <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The shared communications medium may comprise, for example, a computer bus or a multiple access data network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is also in electrical communication with the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> via the shared communications medium <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. When appropriate, Ethernet packets recovered by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are transferred to the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> for transfer to an attached user device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The transmitter portion of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> includes an upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, a low pass filter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, a power amplifier <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and the diplex filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Transmission begins with the reception of a data packet by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The data packet may include data originally received from an attached user device via the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the data packet may be generated by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> as part of the cable modem network management and upkeep. The MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> formats the data packet in compliance with the protocols set forth in the DOCSIS specification. The MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> outputs the data packet to the upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> which converts it into analog form and modulates it onto a carrier signal in accordance with a particular modulation technique. The modulation technique may comprise, without limitation, a Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) technique, an 8-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) technique, a 16-QAM technique, a 32-QAM technique, or a 64-QAM technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> outputs the modulated carrier signal to the low pass filter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> which passes signals with spectral characteristics in a desired bandwidth within the frequency range of approximately 5-42 MHz. The filtered signals are then introduced to the power amplifier <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which amplifies the signal and provides it to the diplex filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The gain in the power amplifier <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is regulated by the burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The diplex filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> isolates the amplified signal and transmits it upstream over the HFC network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during a scheduled burst opportunity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> B. Methods for Mitigating Burst Noise in Accordance with Embodiments of the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> 1. Outer Block Coding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> depict flowcharts <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of methods for mitigating burst noise using outer block coding in a transmitting device and a receiving device in accordance with embodiments of the invention. These flowcharts will be described in reference to an embodiment in which the transmitting device is the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the receiving device is the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, the invention is not so limited. For example, the transmitting device may be a CMTS and the receiving device may be a cable modem. Alternatively, other transmitting and receiving devices may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The method of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, in which the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>receives one or more packets of information for transmission over an upstream channel to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The packets may include voice, data and/or other information. For example, the packets may comprise part of a continuous stream of packets carrying voice information. In an embodiment, the packets arrive at the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, the packets are generated within the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as part of the cable modem network management and upkeep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the one or more packets received at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are collected and reorganized into groups of k information segments. For short packets, this step may comprise simply collecting k packets and identifying each packet as one of k information segments. For longer packets, this step may comprise fragmenting a single packet into k parts, and identifying each part as one of k information segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, an outer block code is applied to the k information segments to generate parity segments. In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> entails arranging the k segments as a series of columns and then performing row-wise parity checks on the rows of the matrix formed by the arrangement of the k columns. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, the arrangement of the k information segments into rows and columns is actually a conceptual step and may not comprise a literal process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The outer block code applied in step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may be any of the many block codes available in the literature, such as an (n, k) binary code, and in particular may be an (n, k) Hamming code. In an embodiment in which the outer code is an (n, k) binary code, each row includes a single bit from each of the k segments and parity check equations are used to compute n-k additional parity bits for each row. These n-k parity bits are arranged to form an additional n-k columns, or parity segments. Thus, the parity checks for each row provide a row of bits for the newly created n-k parity segments. If there are m bits in each of the original k segments, then there will be m parity check rows processed, and the newly created n-k parity segments will each have m bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is an optional processing step in which identification bits are added to each of the k information segments and n-k parity segments. The identification bits may be used to uniquely identify information segments and parity check segments as originating from the same set of n encoded segments. The identification bits may also be used as a counter that establishes the order in which the information segments and parity check segments were originally encoded. In an embodiment, the identification bits may be repeated or otherwise placed in each column with redundancy to increase their robustness beyond the normal data bits in each segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, each of the above steps <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is performed by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, each of the k information segments and n-k parity check segments is adapted for transmission over the physical (PHY) layer of a cable modem system. In a DOCSIS cable modem system, this step includes prepending a MAC header to each segment, optionally performing FEC encoding on the MAC header and the payload, and then prepending a preamble for subsequent burst transmission. As a result, each segment becomes the payload of a separate upstream burst. This step may also include interleaving of the upstream burst. In an embodiment, the prepending of a MAC header to each segment is performed by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while FEC encoding, prepending of a preamble, and interleaving is performed by PHY layer logic (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that resides between the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>separately transmits each burst generated in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> over an upstream communication channel of the cable modem system to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In accordance with a DOCSIS cable modem system, the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>must request a transmission opportunity from the CMTS for each burst it wishes to transmit over the upstream channel. Burst transmission includes the conversion of each burst into analog form and modulation onto a carrier signal by the upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for transmission during an appropriate time slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The method of flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, in which the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives the upstream bursts transmitted from the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, a segment is recovered from each upstream burst. This step includes demodulation of each burst and conversion to digital form by the burst receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. This step may also include deinterleaving and FEC decoding of the burst data by PHY layer logic within the CMTS that resides between the burst receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As shown at step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, bad segments are identified, or marked, as a result of the processing of step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The marking of a bad segment may be referred to as erasure. A bad segment may be marked based on the receipt of a bad burst preamble. Alternately, a bad segment may be marked as a result of FEC decoding of the burst payload. In the latter case, a bad segment will be marked if more errors are detected in a segment than can be corrected by the FEC technique being used. In a DOCSIS cable modem system, Reed-Solomon (RS) coding is used for FEC; however a parity check code may also be used. In either case, FEC has a high probability of detecting an error, even when it cannot correct the error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the recovered segments are passed to the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> where related information segments and parity segments are collected for application of outer block code decoding. In order to properly decode the segments, the n information segments and parity segments that were originally encoded together must be regrouped in the order in which they were encoded. However, these segments may not necessarily be received by the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the back-to-back sequence in which they were encoded, due to interspersed transmissions from other cable modems or even from other service flows generated by the same cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> utilizes identification bits included in each segment in order to collect related information and parity segments. As discussed above in regard to optional step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, identification bits may be added to each segment to uniquely identify segments that originate from the same set of n encoded segments. As also discussed above, the identification bits may also provide a counter that establishes the order in which the information segments and parity segments were originally encoded. Alternatively, the MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may group segments by tracking the grant of upstream bursts to the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which are relayed in a standard DOCSIS MAP message. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, a combination of these techniques, and alternative techniques, may also be used to group the segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> decodes the n related information and parity segments collected in step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> in accordance with the outer block code originally used to encode them in step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, discussed above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The outer block decoding step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes arranging the n information and parity segments as n columns, wherein any segments marked as erased in step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> are placed as erased columns for decoding purposes. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, the arrangement of the segments into columns is actually a conceptual step and may not comprise a literal process. Each row of the matrix formed by the columnar arrangement of the n segments is then decoded to recover bits from erased segments which appear in each row. Decoding of the columns in this manner will also permit error detection and correction of a limited number of individual bit errors in segments that have not been erased, wherein the number of bit errors that may be corrected is determined by the outer block code being used and the number of erased segments. As a result of the decoding step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the original k information segments are recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> reorganizes the k information segments as necessary into one or more packets, reversing the process performed at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. For example, if each of the k information segments represent fragmented portions of a long packet, then the k segments will be concatenated together to reconstitute the long packet. Alternately, in the case where each of the k information segments represents a single packet, no reorganization is performed. The recovered packets are then available for further processing by the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which may, for example, forward the packets to a packet-switched network via the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> a. Hamming Block Coding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> An example of the methods of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in which the outer block code is an extended (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code will now be described. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that a queue of four m length data packets is collected at the cable modem for upstream transmission and organized as four information segments, so through s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, respectively, in accordance with steps <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the four information segments are arranged as a series of columns <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In accordance with step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, parity equations for an (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code are then applied to each row of four information bits created by the arrangement of columns <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to calculate four parity bits for each row. For example, with continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, parity check equations are applied to the row of four information bits s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, s<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, s<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, to generate the four parity bits s<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, s<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, s<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Each resulting row of information and parity bits <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>represents a separate (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming codeword. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The generation of four parity bits for each row results in the creation of four new columns <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. These four new columns <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> correspond to four new parity segments, s<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In accordance with step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, identification bits may be added to each segment s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-s<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>to uniquely identify the segments as originating from the same set of encoded segments and/or to establish the order in which the segments were originally encoded. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the prepending of sequential identification bits <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> to the information segments s<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the parity segments s<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, which results in extended information segments <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and parity segments <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. These identification bits identify the encoding order of each of the segments. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> unique identification number identifying the set of packets may also be added to each segment. Note that the rows created by the addition of the identification bits <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> do not represent (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming codewords. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Each of the segments s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-s<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>is then adapted for transmission over the PHY layer of a cable modem system in accordance with step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, this includes prepending a MAC header to each segment, optionally performing FEC encoding on the MAC header and the payload, and then prepending a preamble for subsequent burst transmission. Where FEC is performed, it may be used to encode the identification bits as well as the data included in each segment. Each segment is then transmitted upstream in one of eight separate bursts of upstream transmission using the DOCSIS PHY, in accordance with step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In accordance with steps <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the eight upstream bursts are received by the CMTS, which recovers the eight segments s -s through the demodulation and optional de-interleaving and FEC decoding of the bursts. Due to an impairment in the upstream channel, one or more of these segments are marked as erased pursuant to step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In accordance with step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of the flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the CMTS then uses the prepended identification bits <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> in each segment to re-assemble the segments s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-s<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>in the column arrangement depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Any erased segments in the matrix are identified at this stage. The CMTS then decodes each row of the assembled matrix using the same (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code scheme implemented in the cable modem to recover lost information segments. Because an (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code has been used, as long as (a) three or fewer segments are erased, or (b) at most one segment is erased and at most one bit error occurs in any row of the remaining seven columns, then the original information segments can be recovered. In 54 out of 70 cases, four of the eight segments can be erased and the original four information segments can still be restored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> b. Exclusive OR (XOR) Coding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, the encoding and decoding steps of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are performed in accordance with an exclusive OR (XOR) code. The XOR code is essentially a (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) code scheme that is applied to four information segments. For example, the XOR code may be applied to four information segments that result from the division of a single packet. Application of the XOR code to four information segments results in the generation of two parity segments. The first parity segment is the result of performing an exclusive OR operation on the data in the first and fourth information segments and the second parity segment is the result of performing an exclusive OR operation on the data in the second and third information segments. In accordance with this technique, any single information segment can be recovered and in 9 out of 15 cases, two missing information segments can be recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> c. Alternate Outer Block Coding Embodiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the information segments organized in step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> need not be of the same length. Thus, a plurality of packets of different lengths may be directly processed as information segments. For example, with reference to the (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code example set forth above, assume that the four information segments, s<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, are each of a different length. In accordance with this alternate embodiment, the three shorter information segments are extended with fill zero data bits prior to row Hamming encoding. As a result, the four parity columns which are created will have the length of the longest of the four original information segments. The fill zeroes may then be stripped off the four information segments after identification bits have been added so that the original information segments are transmitted upstream without the now-unnecessary extending fill bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> At the CMTS, since five of the segments (the longest information segment and each of the four parity segments) have the maximum length, and at least four must make it successfully over the upstream channel to have a chance of completely recovering the upstream data, the maximum data length of the subset of eight segments successfully making it upstream is used for constructing the matrix for Hamming decoding. Extending fill bits once again are added to the three shortest information segments (or those shorter information segments which survive upstream transmission). In this fashion, the techniques of flowcharts <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may be extended to different length information segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, it may be desirable to transmit less than a full set of information segments from the cable modem. This may be the case where the arrival time of packets at the cable modem is not guaranteed. For example, with further reference to the (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming code example set forth above, it may be desirable to proceed with the upstream transmission of segments even though fewer than a full set of four information segments are in the queue. In this case, complete columns of zero filler data are added as part of step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, until four columns are created. Each of these filler columns has a length equal to the maximum length of the data packets which have arrived in the queue. In accordance with this embodiment, the identification bits subsequently added to each segment, including the four parity segments, in step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, include a value describing the total number of information segments in the set (one to four in this embodiment). Then, these additional filler columns may be optionally deleted or removed prior to adaptation for the PHY layer at step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to maintain upstream efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> At the CMTS, in decoding step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, matrix assembly includes examining the total number of information segments described in the identification bits of each successfully received segment. If the majority of the segments indicate that N information segments were encoded, and N is less than <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, then 4-N filler columns of zero data are assembled beginning with column 4N&plus;1 and ending at column <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Decoding then proceeds as if a fall eight segments had been received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 2. Repetition Coding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> depict flowcharts <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> of methods for mitigating burst noise using repetition coding in a transmitting device and a receiving device in accordance with embodiments of the invention. These flowcharts will be described in reference to an embodiment in which the transmitting device is the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the receiving device is the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, the invention is not so limited. For example, in an embodiment, the transmitting device may be a CMTS and the receiving device may be a cable modem. Alternatively, other transmitting and receiving devices may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The method of flowchart <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, in which the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>receives a packet of information for transmission over an upstream channel to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The packet may include voice, data and/or other information. For example, the packet may comprise part of a continuous stream of packets carrying voice information. In an embodiment, the packet arrives at the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, the packet is generated within the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as part of the cable modem network management and upkeep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, the packet received at step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> is copied, or repeated, to generate a total of N packets, where N is an integer of 1 or more. Although any value of N may be used in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, practical values for N, taking into account network bandwidth concerns, may include N&equals;2 or N&equals;3. In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> is performed by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, the original packet received in step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and the repeated packets generated in step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are each adapted for transmission over the physical (PHY) layer of a cable modem system. In a DOCSIS cable modem system, this step includes prepending a MAC header to each packet, optionally performing FEC encoding on the MAC header and the payload, and then prepending a preamble for subsequent burst transmission. As a result, each packet becomes the payload of a separate upstream burst. This step may also include interleaving of the upstream burst. In an embodiment, the prepending of a MAC header to each segment is performed by the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while FEC encoding, prepending of a preamble, and interleaving is performed by PHY layer logic (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that resides between the MAC <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>separately transmits each burst generated in step <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> over an upstream communication channel of a cable modem system to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Burst transmission includes the conversion of each burst into analog form and modulation onto a carrier signal by the upstream burst modulator <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for transmission during an appropriate time slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a DOCSIS cable modem system, to ensure that repeated packets have allocated minislots (i.e., grants) for upstream transmission, either the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>must request additional minislots from the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, or the CMTS must automatically make the necessary additional grants at some point later in time for repeated packets. The time delay between grants for a given repeated packet may be constant, or random, based on efficiently filling the available DOCSIS MAP space. Alternatively, the time delay may be based on avoiding periodic impulse noise. For example, in a case of repetition coding where N&equals;3, the spacing between the first and second grant may be different from the spacing between the second and third grant. This prevents the case of periodic impulses obliterating all three packets due to a synchronization between the periodic impulses and the repeated packets. The optimal spacing between repeated packets will depend on the assumed impulse interarrival time statistics. For CMTS systems which sample, detect, and classify impulse events, this information may be used by the CMTS to determine the optimal spacing of repeated grants. Such a system is disclosed in commonly-owned patent application Ser. No. 09/988,065, entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for the Detection and Classification of Impairments on an RF Modulated Network,&rdquo; filed Nov. 16, 2001, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The method of flowchart <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, in which the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives the upstream bursts transmitted from the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, a packet is recovered from each upstream burst. This step includes demodulation of each burst and conversion to digital form by the burst receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. This step may also include deinterleaving and FEC decoding of the burst data by PHY layer logic within the CMTS that resides between the burst receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> As shown at step <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, bad packets are identified, or marked, as a result of the processing of step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The marking of a bad packet may be referred to as erasure. A bad packet may be marked based on the receipt of a bad burst preamble. Alternately, a bad packet may be marked as a result of FEC decoding of the burst payload. In the latter case, a bad packet will be marked if more errors are detected in a packet than can be corrected by the FEC technique being used. In a DOCSIS cable modem system, Reed-Solomon (RS) coding is used to encode the burst payload; however a parity check code may also be used. In either case, FEC has a high probability of detecting an error, even when it cannot correct the error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, the recovered packets are passed to the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which compares successfully received adjacent packets from a given cable modem service flow and eliminates duplicates, if any, based on the assumption that that they are simply repetitions. In accordance with this technique, provided at least one of the N packets transmitted from the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has not been erased, the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will able to recover the original packet. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, a retransmission technique is implemented that utilizes non-acknowledgment messages (NACKs) rather than ACKs for determining when to retransmit a packet. This alternate embodiment is illustrated in flowcharts <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> 4. FEC Block Reconstruction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention may take advantage of the fact that packets are often transmitted as two or more FEC encoded blocks, or &ldquo;FEC blocks.&rdquo; For example, in a DOCSIS cable modem system, a cable modem may encode a packet using Reed Solomon (RS) techniques to produce two or more FEC blocks, each of which form part of the same upstream burst. During transmission, burst noise on the upstream channel may interfere with some, but not all, of the FEC blocks. Consequently, the CMTS may recover some of the FEC blocks, while erasing others. As will be described in more detail below, the ability of the CMTS to recover at least a portion of a plurality of FEC blocks in a burst permits the CMTS to restore lost information in a manner that is more efficient than if the entire packet were erased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> a. FEC Block Reconstruction and Outer Block Coding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The fact that the CMTS may recover one or more of the FEC blocks of a packet that has been impacted by burst noise can enhance the effectiveness of the outer block coding technique described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. To illustrate this concept, assume that the outer block code is the (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Hamming block code described above, which permits four information segments to be recovered by the CMTS provided that no more than three of the eight transmitted segments (four information segments plus four parity segments) are erased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> However, assume that each of the information and parity segments in this example has been FEC encoded to generate a first FEC block followed by a second FEC block. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in which information segment s<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, information segment s<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, information segment s<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC block s<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and information segment s<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Likewise, parity segment s<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, parity segment s<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, parity segment s<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and parity segment s<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>has been FEC encoded to generate FEC block s<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and s<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this example, as long as no more than three of the eight first FEC blocks in each segment are bad, then the first FEC block in each information segment may be recovered, and as long as no more than three of the eight second FEC blocks in each segment are bad, then the second FEC block in each information segment may be recovered. Thus, with continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, as long as no more than three of the first FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>are bad, then the first FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in each information segment s<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>may be recovered. Likewise, as long as no more than three of the eight second FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are bad, then the second FEC blocks s<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in each information segment s<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through s<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>may be recovered. As a result, there may be instances where as many as six out of the eight segments transmitted have a bad FEC block due to burst noise, but nevertheless all four information segments may be recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In order to implement this technique, the methods already described in reference to flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may be used with slight modification. In this case, step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> would necessarily include FEC encoding each information and parity segment to generate two or more FEC blocks per segment. In other words, each segment is divided into two or more FEC blocks prior to transmission over the upstream channel. On the receiving side, step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> would comprise identifying bad FEC blocks within each segment, rather than simply identifying bad segments, and step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> would comprise performing outer block code decoding to replace bad FEC blocks within each segment, rather than to replace bad segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Where a bad FEC block cannot be recovered through the application of the outer block code, the FEC block, or the segment containing the bad FEC block, can be re-requested from the cable modem. Alternately, a repetition technique, as described below, may be utilized to ensure successful transmission of the FEC block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> b. FEC Block Reconstruction and Repetition Coding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> depict flowcharts <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> of methods for mitigating burst noise using repetition and FEC block reconstruction techniques in a transmitting device and a receiving device in accordance with embodiments of the invention. These flowcharts will be described in reference to an embodiment in which the transmitting device is the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the receiving device is the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, the invention is not so limited. For example, in an embodiment, the transmitting device may be a CMTS and the receiving device may be a cable modem. Alternatively, other transmitting and receiving devices may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The method of flowchart <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>, in which the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>receives a packet of information for transmission over an upstream channel to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>, the packet received at step <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> is copied, or repeated, to generate a total of N packets, where N is an integer of 1 or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight>, the original packet received in step <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> and the repeated packets generated in step <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> are each FEC encoded into 2 or more FEC blocks. In a DOCSIS cable modem system, this step comprises applying a Reed-Solomon algorithm to each packet to generate 2 or more FEC blocks per packet. At step <highlight><bold>1608</bold></highlight>, each packet is further adapted for transmission over the physical (PHY) layer of a cable modem system. For example, a preamble may be prepended to the FEC blocks for subsequent burst transmission. As a result of steps <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1608</bold></highlight>, each packet becomes the payload of a separate upstream burst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>separately transmits each burst generated in steps <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1608</bold></highlight> over an upstream communication channel of a cable modem system to the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> At the first step <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>, the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives the upstream bursts transmitted from the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during step <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight> of flowchart <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>, a packet is recovered from each upstream burst. This step includes FEC decoding of the burst data. At step <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight>, the bad FEC blocks associated with each packet are identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight>, the recovered packets are passed to the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the CMTS <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which attempts to identify at least one complete packet that has been received successfully from the N packets transmitted from the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. If no complete packets have been received successfully, then the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will attempt to reconstruct the original packet from successfully received FEC blocks from each of the N packets transmitted from the cable modem <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Provided that the burst noise or other impairment on the communication channel affected different FEC blocks of each repeated packet, the MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will be able to reconstruct the complete packet from the good FEC blocks of each packet. In an embodiment, the headend MAC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> keeps track of good FEC blocks by building a list of successfully received FEC blocks from each packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> c. Alternative FEC Block Reconstruction Embodiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Alternative techniques for mitigating burst noise using FEC block reconstruction in accordance with embodiments of the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, the CMTS receives a packet from the cable modem and identifies bad FEC blocks within each packet. The CMTS then sends a request to the cable modem to retransmit only those FEC blocks that were in error, while storing the good FEC blocks. When the CMTS subsequently receives the retransmitted FEC blocks from the cable modem, it reconstructs the complete packet and forwards it for further processing. If the retransmitted FEC blocks are still in error, the CMTS may send a second retransmission request, either in the same manner as before, or perhaps modifying some of the signaling parameters so that the FEC blocks may be retransmitted using a different channel or time slot relative to the interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this technique, a protocol is required for the CMTS to request the retransmission of bad FEC blocks. In a cable modem system, this protocol may be implemented using the DOCSIS protocol with extensions for data ACKs and/or NACKs, a separate protocol using an out-of-band channel, or an Ethernet protocol whereby the CMTS sends the retransmission request to the cable modem as an Ethernet packet. Another method of retransmitting FEC blocks that were erased is to use the REQ/DAT structure of DOCSIS for retransmitting individual FEC blocks. Several REQ/DAT packets may need to be sent in order to retransmit all FEC blocks that were originally erased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, if the CMTS receives a packet with one or more bad FEC blocks, it transmits data ACKs and/or NACKs to request that the cable modem retransmit the entire original packet. The CMTS saves the FEC blocks that were successfully received from each attempt and reconstructs the original packet when all FEC blocks have been correctly received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, a combination of repetition coding and data ACKs/NACKs are used to implement FEC block reconstruction. In this embodiment, packets are initially transmitted from the cable modem to the CMTS using repetition coding as described herein. If the CMTS determines that the same FEC block in each of N repeated packets is bad, then the CMTS transmits data ACKSs and/or NACKs to the cable modem to request that the FEC block be selectively retransmitted and possibly repeated as well to increase robustness and minimize latency. Alternately, the initial packet can be sent once, and if it is received by the CMTS with bad FEC blocks, those FEC blocks can be retransmitted and repetition coded to improve the chance that the erased FEC blocks will survive transmission the second time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> 5. Outer Coding and Packet Header Suppression </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The outer coding techniques described above may have an adverse effect on network capacity. Indeed, where the outer coding technique is a repetition code, sending a single packet several times reduces the overall capacity of the network by the same amount as the repetition factor. For example, sending a packet two times will consume twice as much capacity as sending it a single time, reducing network capacity to 50%. One way to mitigate this reduction in capacity is to utilize packet header suppression technology in conjunction with such outer coding techniques to reduce the size of each packet. For example, Broadcom&apos;s Propane&trade; header suppression technology may be used to offset the bandwidth-consuming effect of repetition coding. Propane&trade; is an advanced transport technology for DOCSIS-based cable modem systems that is available from Broadcom Corporation of Irvine, Calif. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the case of small packets, a large percentage of the total packet consists of protocol headers. These headers are highly structured and can be coded to a much smaller size in most cases. Application of Propane&trade; packet header suppression in a DOCSIS environment results in a 50% capacity savings over uncompressed packets. When used in conjunction with outer coding for small packets, Propane&trade; transport technology completely mitigates the capacity effects of repetition coding where the repetition factor is N&equals;2. Where the repetition factor is N&equals;3, using Propane&trade; transport technology results in network capacity of 66% as opposed to 33% for uncompressed packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> To use Propane&trade; transport technology in conjunction with outer coding in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a transmitting device preferably encodes a packet to be transmitted by the Propane&trade; coding process prior to the application of outer coding (e.g., outer block coding or repetition coding). At the receiving device, the outer code decoding process preferably reassembles the packet and corrects errors as needed prior to decoding of the packet by the Propane&trade; process, which results in the full-size original packet. Alternately, packet header suppression may be applied by the transmitting device after application of outer coding and by the receiving device prior to outer code decoding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> 6. Outer Coding of Downstream Transmissions in a Cable Modem System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), the techniques set forth above may be advantageously applied to downstream transmissions from a CMTS to a cable modem, even where these transmissions are continuous as in a DOCSIS cable modem system. While the DOCSIS downstream implements FEC and interleaving in the PHY layer to combat burst noise, additional burst noise mitigation can be gained by implementing methods in accordance with the present invention on the downstream link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> On the DOCSIS downstream, packets for a particular cable modem or service flow may or may not be transmitted contiguously. Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, outer coding may be applied to one or more packets with different cable modem or service flow destinations, which will serve to increase the robustness of the downstream link in the presence of severe impairments. In any case, the downstream PHY will be unaffected by the addition of the higher level outer coding, except that it may now be required to carry more traffic as bursts carrying parity segments or repeated packets are transmitted. This increased traffic may be offset, however, by the fact that fewer re-transmissions may be required in the downstream due to the resultant mitigation of burst errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> 7. Transmission Scheduling </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, outer encoded packets (e.g., block-encoded information and parity segments or repetition-coded packets) are transmitted in separate bursts, as opposed to bundling of outer encoded packets. The separation of these outer encoded packets in their transmission through the channel is critical in any medium where the success or failure of an entire burst transmission (or portion of transmission in a continuous emission) may occur. An example is a burst transmission system where preamble, post-amble, or other synchronization symbols or methods are disbursed around or within the information waveform, and wherein an impairment level within the channel sometimes cause the burst to not be properly or adequately synchronized and adjusted at the receiver, so that much of the information in the burst is not recoverable at the receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Another example is a transitory impairment, which may impact the medium so severely that an entire burst is lost or severely corrupted if coincident with the rise in the impairment (or in a continuous transmission, the impairment causes an outage for a significant duration of time). Examples of such impairments include but are not limited to the many types of fading experienced and described in wireless communications, and in the burst noise environment described herein in reference to cable modem systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with outer block coding embodiments of the present invention, it is critical that the individual bits of each information segment are separated into columns and that each row created thereby is covered with parity checks, creating new parity segments. It is also critical that each of these segments be transmitted separately (such as separate bursts in a bursted scheme, or perhaps separated in time in a continuous scheme), and received, assembled and processed as individual columns at the receiver, and then, after recovering the individual columns wherever possible, applying row parity to fill in lost and/or severely corrupted columns, a row at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> C. Example Software Implementation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> As discussed elsewhere herein, the above-described techniques or methods may be implemented as software routines that are executed, in part, by the MAC of a cable modem and/or the headend MAC of a CMTS.
