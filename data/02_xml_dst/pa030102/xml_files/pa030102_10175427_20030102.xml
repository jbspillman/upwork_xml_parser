<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a level shifter that has a simple configuration and that quickly converts a low-amplitude logic signal into a high-amplitude logic signal. The present invention also relates to the technical field of an electro-optical apparatus incorporating the level shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, electro-optical apparatuses that allow display by electro-optical change in electro-optical materials such as liquid crystal and organic EL (electroluminescence) materials are coming to be widely used in various information processing apparatuses and television sets as alternative display devices to cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such electro-optical apparatuses can be broadly classified, by their driving methods, into active matrix type in which pixels are driven by non-linear devices such as transistors and diodes, and passive matrix type in which pixels are driven without using nonlinear devices. It is believed that electro-optical apparatuses of the former type, i.e., active matrix type, allow display of higher quality because pixels are driven independently of each other therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An electro-optical apparatus of active matrix type is constructed as follows. In an electro-optical apparatus of active matrix type, pixel electrodes are formed respectively in association with intersections of scanning lines extending in a row direction and data lines extending in a column direction. Furthermore, non-linear devices, such as thin-film transistors, that turn on and off according to scanning signals supplied to the scanning lines are disposed between the pixel electrodes and the data lines at the intersections, and an opposing electrode is formed so as to oppose the pixel electrodes via an electro-optical material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to drive the electro-optical material and the non-linear devices, a relatively high voltage is required. On the other hand, an external control circuit for supplying a clock signal, a control signal, etc. for driving to the electro-optical apparatus is usually implemented by CMOS circuits, and the amplitude of a logic signal therefor is on the order of 3 to 5 V. Thus, the electro-optical apparatus typically includes an amplitude conversion circuit (hereinafter referred to simply as a &ldquo;level shifter&rdquo;) for converting a low-amplitude logic signal into a high-amplitude logic signal at an output of a driving circuit for driving the scanning lines and the data lines or at an input of a clock signal, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In recent years, a strong demand has arisen for higher resolution and larger number of steps in intensity level of display in electro-optical apparatuses. Thus, in electro-optical apparatuses, fast operation of level shifters as well as fast operation of driving circuits themselves is required. Furthermore, in addition to higher resolution, a larger number of pixels in a unit length is demanded, requiring reduction in scale of circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the situation described above, and an object thereof is to provide a level shifter that has a simple configuration with reduced scale of circuitry and that allows fast operation, and an electro-optical apparatus incorporating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, a level shifter according to the present invention comprises a first capacitor, to a first end of which a low-amplitude logic signal is input; a first offset circuit for applying a first offset voltage to a second end of the first capacitor; a second capacitor, to a first end of which the low-amplitude logic signal is input; a second offset circuit for applying a second offset voltage to a second end of the second capacitor; and a first and a second switching elements, connected in series between a supply line of a power supply voltage for a high-amplitude logic signal and a supply line of a reference voltage therefor, the first switching element being connected to the second end of the first capacitor, while the second switching element being connected to the second end of the second capacitor in accordance with the offset voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the above arrangement, DC component is removed from the low-amplitude logic signal by each of the first and second capacitors, and the first and second offset voltages are applied by the first and second offset circuits, respectively. For example, the arrangement is such that the first switching element turns on if a signal voltage at the second end of the first capacitor is not higher than a first threshold value, which is set to be lower than the first offset voltage, and the second switching element turns on if a signal voltage at the second end of the second capacitor is at or above a second threshold value, which is set to be higher than the second offset voltage, so that the first and the second switching elements, the operating points thereof having been modified, complementarily turn on and off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a preferred mode, as in the above example, the first switching element turns on if a signal voltage at the second end of the first capacitor is not higher than a first threshold value, which is set to be lower than the first offset voltage, and the second switching element turns on if a signal voltage at the second end of the second capacitor is at or above a second threshold value, which is set to be higher than the second offset voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the above arrangement, preferably, the first switching element is a P-channel transistor and the second switching element is an N-channel transistor, the first offset circuit is implemented by a P-channel transistor and an N-channel transistor connected in series between the supply line of the power supply voltage and the supply line of the reference voltage, a voltage at a node therebetween serving as the first offset voltage and as gate voltages of the P-channel transistor and the N-channel transistor, and the second offset circuit is implemented by a P-channel transistor and an N-channel transistor connected in series between the supply line of the power supply voltage and the supply line of the reference voltage, a voltage at a node therebetween serving as the second offset voltage and as gate voltages of the P-channel transistor and the N-channel transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the above arrangement, even if transistor characteristics of one channel type differ from those of the other channel type, the first or the second offset voltage changes so as to offset the difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The above arrangement is suitable for a low-amplitude logic signal that has a frequency sufficiently high in relation to the capacitance of the first and the second capacitors and that changes regularly (e.g., a clock signal having a duty ratio of 50%). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> However, a problem exists that when a logic signal having a low frequency is input or when an input logic signal is maintained at the same logic level, on/off status of the first and the second switching elements becomes indeterminate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Thus, preferably, in the above arrangement, the offset voltages of the first and the second offset circuits are changed according to the output of the level shifter, that is, according to the voltage at the node between the first and the second switching elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the above arrangement, once on/off status of the first and the second switching elements is determined, the potential at the output terminal is subsequently prevented from becoming indeterminate, due to voltage attenuation of the first or the second capacitor at the output terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, in an initial state, for example, immediately after power-up, the potential at the output terminal inevitably becomes indeterminate unless the logic level of the input logic signal transits. Accordingly, in a preferred arrangement, an initialization circuit for applying an initialization voltage to the second end of the first capacitor and to the second end of the second capacitor is provided so that the first and the second switching elements turn on and off exclusively with each other regardless of the output of the level shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the first and second offset circuit, a problem exists that generally a small current flows to cause waste of power. For example, if the first and second offset circuits are implemented by N-channel transistors and P-channel transistors as described earlier, a small current flows therebetween, causing waste of power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in this arrangement, preferably, the &ldquo;power supply voltages&rdquo; and the &ldquo;reference voltages&rdquo; supplied to the offset circuits are at least partially replaced with the &ldquo;low-amplitude logic signal.&rdquo; According to this arrangement, for example, if the offset circuits are implemented by N-channel transistors and P-channel transistors as described earlier, the potential difference therebetween changes in synchronization with the low-amplitude logic signal; thus, periods of reduced potential difference, compared with the arrangement in which the power supply voltages and the reference voltages are supplied, can be achieved. The reduction in the potential difference serves to reduce power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although the low-amplitude logic signal is used as means for reducing the potential difference between the N-channel transistors and the P-channel transistors constituting the offset circuits in the above arrangement, the present invention is not limited thereto, and a signal synchronized with the low-amplitude logic signal may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Which of the power supplies supplied to the offset circuits is replaced with the low-amplitude logic signal or the signal synchronized with the low-amplitude logic signal is a matter of design determined in accordance with the operation mode of level shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As an arrangement for avoiding waste of power, a level shifter may include a second capacitor, to a first end of which a low-amplitude logic signal is input; a second offset circuit for applying a second offset voltage to a second end of the second capacitor; and a first and a second switching elements, connected in series between a supply line of a power supply voltage for a high-amplitude logic signal and a supply line of a reference voltage therefor, a node therebetween serving as an output terminal, wherein the first switching element turns on when the low-amplitude logic signal is L level, and the second switching element turns on when a signal voltage at the second end of the second capacitor is at or above a second threshold voltage, which is set to be higher than the second offset voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the above arrangement, essentially, the first capacitor and the first offset circuit are absent in the level shifter according to the present invention described earlier, so that the low-amplitude logic signal is directly input to the first switching element, the first switching element turning on when the logic signal is at L level. Accordingly, since the first offset circuit itself is absent, power consumption therein need not be considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Since the first capacitor and the first offset circuit are absent as described above, the constituent devices are eliminated, serving to improve manufacturing yield and to reduce cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As an alternative arrangement, a level shifter may comprise a first capacitor, to a first end of which a low-amplitude logic signal is input; an offset circuit for applying a first offset voltage to a second end of the first capacitor; and a first and a second switching elements, connected in series between a supply line of a power supply voltage for a high-amplitude logic signal and a supply line of a reference voltage therefor, a node therebetween serving as an output terminal, wherein the first switching element turns on if a signal voltage at the second end of the first capacitor is at or below a first threshold voltage, which is set to be lower than the first offset voltage, and the second switching element turns on when the low-amplitude logic signal is at H level. The choice between the arrangements is a matter of design determined in accordance with the operation mode of level shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By applying a level shifter according to the present invention to a driving circuit of an electro-optical apparatus, resolution and number of steps in intensity level can be considerably increased. Furthermore, scale of circuitry can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The above and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of embodiments.</paragraph>

The TFTs <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> constitute an inverter at an output stage of the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The common drain of the TFTs <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> constitute the output terminal OUT of the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> To the second end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, i.e., to the gate Pin of the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, an offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>is applied by a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> constituting a first offset circuit. The offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>is at the midpoint potential between the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>if the characteristics of the P-channel and N-channel TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> constituting the first offset circuit are ideally balanced. More specifically, a source of the TFT <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is connected to the supply line of the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>, a source of the TFT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is connected to the supply line of the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>, and drains and gates of the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are commonly connected with each other, and the common node is connected to the second end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (the gate Pin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Similarly, on the second end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (the gate Nin), an offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2</subscript></highlight>, which is at the midpoint potential between the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>, is applied by a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> constituting a second offset circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> For simplicity of description, it is assumed in this embodiment that the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSL </subscript></highlight>corresponding to L level of the low-amplitude signal and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>corresponding to L level of the high-amplitude signal are at the same potential, and that the voltage swing of the high-amplitude signal is double that of the low-amplitude signal, i.e., (V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>)&equals;2(V<highlight><subscript>DDL</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>SSL</subscript></highlight>). Also, for simplicity of description, on-resistance of TFTs will be disregarded; thus, various waveforms illustrated for description somewhat differ from actual waveforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a threshold voltage VthP based on which the P-channel TFTs turn on or off are set to be lower than the midpoint voltage between the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. Similarly, a threshold voltage VthN based on which the N-channel TFTs turn on or off is set to be higher than the midpoint voltage between the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Since the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>applied by the first offset circuit constituted of the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is (V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>)/2, the threshold voltage VthP in this embodiment is set to be lower than the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1</subscript></highlight>. Similarly, since the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>applied by the second offset circuit constituted of the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is (V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>)/2, the threshold voltage VthN in this embodiment is set to be higher than the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> configured as above will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram showing voltage waveforms at nodes relevant to description of the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When a low-amplitude logic signal, for example, having a duty ratio of 50%, is supplied to the input terminal IN, a voltage waveform corresponding to a differential waveform of the logic signal offset by the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>appears at the gate Pin, whereas a voltage waveform corresponding to a differential waveform of the logic signal offset by the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>appears at the gate Nin. Since the offset voltages V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>are the same in this embodiment, the voltage waveforms that appear at the gates Pin and Nin are identical, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the voltage at the gate Pin exceeds the threshold voltage VthP and the voltage at the gate Nin is at or above the threshold voltage VthN, the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns off and the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns on, whereby the potential of the common drain Cd is pulled to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the potential at the output terminal OUT, i.e., the potential having been inverted by the inverter (the TFTs <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) at the output stage, is pulled to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the voltage at the gate Pin is at or below the threshold voltage VthP and the voltage at the gate Nin falls below the threshold voltage VthN, the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns on and the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns off, whereby the potential at the common drain Cd is pulled to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the potential at the output terminal OUT is pulled to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The offset voltages V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>are at the midpoint voltage between the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>when the characteristics of the P-channel TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the characteristics of the N-channel TFTs <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are ideally balanced. However, when the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed in an integrated form, it is difficult to achieve an ideal balance between the characteristics of the P-channel and N-channel TFTs, because of variations that occur in manufacturing, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, this embodiment operates so that difference in the characteristics of the transistors will be offset, as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, let it be assumed that the characteristics of the N-channel TFTs including the TFTs <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are inferior to the characteristic of the P-channel TFTs including the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the N-channel TFTs being inferior indicates that the N-channel TFTs are less likely to turn on; that is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the threshold voltage thereof becomes higher compared with a case where the characteristics of the P-channel and N-channel TFTs are equivalent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> If the characteristics of the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is inferior to the characteristics of the P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the resistance of the former is higher than that of the latter; thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>at the node therebetween becomes higher compared with a case where the characteristics of the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are equivalent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thus, the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> becomes less likely to turn on due to the threshold voltage VthN being higher, but at the same time the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>becomes higher. That is, the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>rises so as to offset reduction in the likelihood of the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turning on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A similar situation occurs in a case where, conversely, the characteristics of the P-channel TFTs are inferior to the characteristics of the N-channel TFTs, although not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to this embodiment, even if characteristics of TFTs of one channel type are inferior to those of TFTs of the other channel type, the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>or V<highlight><subscript>ofs2 </subscript></highlight>changes so as to offset difference in the characteristics, so that this embodiment is unsusceptible to the effect of the difference in the TFT characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> &lt;Second Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment described above, the logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN has a frequency sufficiently high in relation to a time constant determined by the capacitance of the capacitors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and associated circuit elements, and has a duty ratio of approximately 50%. The signal is typically like a clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, however, the signal voltage of the differential waveform associated with the capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) ultimately converges to the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1 </subscript></highlight>(V<highlight><subscript>ofs2</subscript></highlight>); thus, if the frequency of an input logic signal is low or if an input logic signal remains at the same logic level for a long period as in the case of an irregular pulse signal, the signal voltage of the differential waveform changes across the threshold voltage VthP (VthN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, if the logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN transits to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDL </subscript></highlight>corresponding to H level and is maintained for a relatively long period, the potential at the gate Nin falls below the threshold voltage VthN. Thus, even though the logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN is at the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDL </subscript></highlight>corresponding to H level, the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> as well as the P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns off, leaving the potential at the common drain Cd in an unintended state. Similarly, when the logic signal input to the input terminal IN transits to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSL </subscript></highlight>corresponding to L level and is maintained for a relatively long period, the potential at the gate Pin exceeds the threshold voltage VthP. Thus, even though the logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN is at the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSL </subscript></highlight>corresponding to L level, the P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as well as the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns off, leaving the potential at the common drain Cd in an unintended state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the potential at the common drain Cd is left uncontrolled as described above, the potential at the output terminal OUT in the inverter at the output stage is also left in an unintended state. Thus, although the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment allows fast operation, restriction is imposed on the input logic signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Now, a second embodiment, which is free of the above restriction, will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a level shifter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment. Referring to the figure, difference from the first embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) lies in that an N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are additionally provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> More specifically, with regard to the TFT <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a gate thereof is connected to the common drain Cd of the TFTs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a source thereof is connected to the supply line of the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>, and a drain thereof is connected to the drains (gates) of the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. That is, the TFT <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> turns on if the potential at the common drain Cd is at H level of the high-amplitude signal, forcibly pulling the potential at the gate Pin of the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Similarly, with regard to the TFT <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, a gate thereof is connected to the common drain Cd of the TFTs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a source thereof is connected to the supply line of the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>, and a drain thereof is connected to the drains (gates) of the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. That is, the TFT <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> turns on if the potential at the common drain Cd is at L level of the high-amplitude signal, forcibly pulling the potential at the gate Nin of the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The configuration is otherwise the same as in the first embodiment, and thus will not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> configured as above will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram showing voltage waveforms at nodes relevant to description of the operation. As described earlier, for simplicity of description, on-resistance of TFTs will be disregarded. Thus, various waveforms illustrated for description somewhat differ from actual waveforms; however, this will not be any problem in understanding the gist of the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When the low-amplitude logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN transits from the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSL </subscript></highlight>to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDL</subscript></highlight>, the potential at the gate Pin exceeds the threshold voltage VthP at a rise of the differential waveform thereof, turning off the P-channel TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, while the potential at the gate Nin is at or above the threshold voltage VthN, turning on the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the potential at the common drain Cd is pulled to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>corresponding to L level. Thus, the TFT <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> turns on, and as a result, the potential at the gate Nin is maintained at the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>regardless of the offset voltage applied by the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, even if the low-amplitude logic signal is subsequently maintained at the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDL </subscript></highlight>for a long period, the potential at the gate Nin does not fall below the threshold voltage VthN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, since the TFT <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> turns off, the potential at the gate Pin corresponds to the differential waveform of the input logic signal offset by the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1</subscript></highlight>, similarly to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the low-amplitude logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN transits from the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDL </subscript></highlight>to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSL</subscript></highlight>, the potential at the gate Pin is at or below the threshold voltage VthP at a fall of the differential waveform of the logic signal, turning on the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, while the potential at the gate Nin falls below the threshold voltage VthN, turning off the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the potential at the common drain Cd is pulled to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>corresponding to H level. Thus, the TFT <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> turns on, and as a result, the potential at the gate Nin is maintained at the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>regardless of the offset voltage applied by the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, even if the low-amplitude logic signal is subsequently maintained at the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSL </subscript></highlight>for a long period, the potential at the gate Pin does not exceed the threshold voltage VthP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, since the TFT <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> turns off, the potential at the gate Nin corresponds to the differential waveform of the input logic signal offset by the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2</subscript></highlight>, similarly to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the level shifter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment, even if the input logic signal is maintained at the same logic level for a long period, the TFTs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> do not turn off simultaneously. Thus, according to the second embodiment, restriction is not imposed on the input logic signal as opposed to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Actually, however, the offset voltage is determined by the resistance ratio of the three transistors constituting the first or the second offset circuit. Thus, it is to be noted that more complex waveforms will be output than those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for simplified description of the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> &lt;Third Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the potential at the gate Pin or Nin is forcibly pulled to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>or the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>depending on the potential at the common drain Cd; that is, the gate potential on the input side is determined according to the drain potential on the output side. Thus, a problem exists that the output is indeterminate in an initial state, for example, immediately after power-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Now, a third embodiment, which is free of the above problem, will be described. In the third embodiment, a first mode in which the potentials at the gates Pin and Nin are reset to a potential corresponding to L level, and a second mode in which the potentials are reset to a potential corresponding to H level can be assumed, and description will first be directed to the first mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a level shifter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> according to the first mode of the third embodiment. Referring to the figure, difference from the second embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) lies in that N-channel TFTs <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> are additionally provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> More specifically, with regard to the TFT <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, a source thereof is connected to the supply line of the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>, and a drain thereof is connected to the drains (gates) of the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. With regard to the TFT <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, a source thereof is connected to the supply line of the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>, and a drain thereof is connected to the drains (gates) of the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. To the gates of the TFTs <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, a reset pulse Rp, which is pulled to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>at the time of resetting, is supplied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The configuration is otherwise the same as the second embodiment, will not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a diagram showing voltage waveforms at nodes relevant to description of the operation of the level shifter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When the potential of the logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN remains the same immediately after power-up, the potential at the gate Pin is at the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs1</subscript></highlight>, and the potential at the gate Nin is at the offset voltage V<highlight><subscript>ofs2</subscript></highlight>. In this state, the TFTs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> both turn off, leaving the potential at the drain Cd, and therefore the potential at the output terminal OUT, indeterminate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the reset pulse Rp is supplied with the potential thereof at the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>, the TFTs <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> turn on, whereby the potentials at the gates Pin and Nin are forcibly reset to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns on and the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns off, whereby the drain Cd is pulled to and becomes determinate at the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>. The subsequent operation is the same as in the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a level shifter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> according to the second mode of the third embodiment. Referring to the figure, difference from the second embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) lies in that P-channel TFTs <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> are additionally provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> More specifically, with regard to the TFT <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, a source thereof is connected to the supply line of the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>, and a drain thereof is connected to the drains (gates) of the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. With regard to the TFT <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, a source thereof is connected to the supply line of the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>, and a drain thereof is connected to the drains (gates) of the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. To the gates of the TFTs <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, a set pulse Sp, which is pulled to the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>at the time of setting, is supplied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The configuration is otherwise the same as in the second embodiment, and will not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a diagram showing voltage waveforms at nodes relevant to description of the operation of the level shifter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> If the potential of the logic signal supplied to the input terminal IN remains the same immediately after power-up, by the same reason as in the first mode, the TFTs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> both turn off, leaving the potential at the drain Cd, and therefore the potential at the output terminal OUT, indeterminate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> When the set pulse Sp is supplied with the potential thereof at the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>, the TFTs <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> turn on, whereby the potentials at the gates Pin and Nin are forcibly set to the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns off and the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns on, whereby the drain Cd is pulled to and becomes determinate at the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>. The subsequent operation is the same as in the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Actually, however, the offset voltage is determined by the resistance ratio of the three transistors constituting the first or the second offset circuit and the transistors provided for initialization. Thus, it is to be noted that more complex waveforms will be output than those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> for simplified description of the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> &lt;Fourth Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, a level shifter that has a simple configuration and that allows fast operation can be implemented. However, the level shifters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> according to the first to the third embodiment described above commonly suffer from the following problem; that is, electric power is wasted in the first offset circuit constituted of the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and in the second offset circuit constituted of the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. This is because a voltage difference between the higher potential V<highlight><subscript>DDH </subscript></highlight>and the lower potential V<highlight><subscript>SSH </subscript></highlight>is constantly applied between the TFTs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or between the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the first or the second offset circuit, whereby a small current flows from the TFT <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the TFT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or from the TFT <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to the TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Now, a fourth embodiment of the present invention, which is free of the above problem, will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a level shifter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> according to the fourth embodiment. The level shifter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> shown in the figure is based on the first embodiment, and the fourth embodiment can be considered as a modification of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> short-circuiting line <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for short-circuiting the source of the TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> constituting the second offset circuit with the input terminal IN is provided. Accordingly, the voltage applied between the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the second offset circuit is reduced. More specifically, for example, assuming that V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&equals;6 &lsqb;V&rsqb;, V<highlight><subscript>DDL</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 &lsqb;V&rsqb;, and V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>&equals;V<highlight><subscript>SSL</subscript></highlight>&equals;0 &lsqb;V&rsqb;, as opposed to the first embodiment in which a potential difference of V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>SSH</subscript></highlight>&equals;6 &lsqb;V&rsqb; is constantly applied while in operation, in the fourth embodiment, the voltage takes on one of two values V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>DDL</subscript></highlight>&equals;6 &lsqb;V&rsqb; and V<highlight><subscript>DDH</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>SSL</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 &lsqb;V&rsqb; in synchronization with the input signal. Because periods of reduced potential difference exist, current that flows between the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the rise in the offset potential improves driving ability of the N-channel TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Thus, the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be reduced in size in the fourth embodiment compared with the first embodiment described earlier. The configuration is otherwise the same as in the first embodiment, and will not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Although the arrangement described above is such that the source of the TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> constituting the second offset circuit is short-circuited with the input terminal IN, the present invention is not limited thereto. The same advantages can be achieved by an arrangement in which voltages supplied to the offset circuits are partially supplied from an input signal line. Which of the voltages is replaced with the input signal is a matter of design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although the arrangement described above is such that an input signal is directly input to the TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the second offset circuit, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, the advantages of this embodiment may be implemented by means other than short-circuiting the TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> or the TFT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> with the input terminal IN. More broadly, the voltages supplied to the offset circuits can be partially replaced by a separate power supply for generating a signal synchronized with the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> &lt;Fifth Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the fourth embodiment, waste of power can be avoided by inputting an input signal to the first or the second offset circuit. Hereinafter, an arrangement that achieves substantially the same advantages more efficiently will be described as a fifth embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a level shifter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the fifth embodiment. The level shifter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> shown in this figure is based on the first embodiment described earlier, and the fifth embodiment can be considered as a modification of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the first offset circuit, provided in the embodiments described above, are absent. The configuration is otherwise the same as the first embodiment, and will not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the level shifter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> configured as above will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a diagram showing voltage waveforms at nodes relevant to description of the operation. Since the fifth embodiment is based on the first embodiment as mentioned above, the operation is substantially the same as that described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Thus, illustration and description of common features will be omitted or simplified, and description will be directed to characterizing features of the fifth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the fifth embodiment, when a low-amplitude logic signal having a duty ratio of 50% is supplied to the input terminal IN, a voltage waveform directly reflecting the waveform of the logic signal appears at the gate Pin. This is because the capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the first offset circuit are not present. A voltage waveform that appears at the gate Nin is the same as in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the voltage at the gate Pin exceeds the threshold voltage VthP, i.e., when the value of the input signal is V<highlight><subscript>DDL</subscript></highlight>, and also the voltage at the gate Nin is at or above the threshold voltage VthN, the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns off and the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns on. On the other hand, when the voltage at the gate Pin is at or below the threshold voltage VthP, i.e., when the value of the input signal is V<highlight><subscript>SSL</subscript></highlight>, and also the voltage at the gate Nin falls below the threshold voltage VthN, the TFT <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> turns on and the TFT <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> turns off. The potentials at the subsequent inverter (TFTs <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) and at the output terminal OUT are substantially the same as those described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the fifth embodiment, since the first offset circuit is absent as described above, no such thing as power consumed therein is to be considered. That is, in the fifth embodiment, compared with the first embodiment described earlier, power consumption is reduced due to the absence of the first offset circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Although the first offset circuit is absent in the arrangement described above, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, conversely, a level shifter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime;, in which the second offset circuit is absent, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, may be implemented. According to the arrangement, since the second offset circuit is not present, no such thing as power consumed therein is to be considered. Accordingly, power consumption is reduced, achieving substantially the same advantage as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> &lt;Supplementary Description of Embodiments&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Although the fourth and fifth embodiments employ configurations based on the level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, short-circuiting of the source of the TFT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> constituting the first or the second offset circuit with the input terminal IN (the fourth embodiment) and the absence of the first or the second offset circuit (the fifth embodiment), etc. may be applied to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (the second embodiment), <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (the first mode of the third embodiment), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (the second mode of the third embodiment). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is to be understood that an arrangement having a combination of the features of the fourth and fifth embodiments is within the scope of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows, as an example thereof, a level shifter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, in which the source of the TFT <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the second offset circuit is short-circuited with the input terminal IN via the short-circuiting line <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> as in the fourth embodiment and in which the capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the first offset circuit are absent as in the fifth embodiment. The arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is based on the second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and a capacitor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is provided for the purpose of feedback from the common drain Cd. Thus, as described in relation to the second embodiment, even if the input signal exhibits DC variation, substantially the same advantage, i.e., stable operation, is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> According to the above arrangement, a potential difference applied between the TFTs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the second offset circuit is reduced compared with before, so that waste of power is avoided. In addition, because the first offset circuit is not present, no such thing as power consumption in the first offset circuit exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In sum, according to the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, advantages of both the fourth and the fifth embodiments are simultaneously achieved. The inventors of the present invention verified that it is possible to reduce power consumption to on the order of &frac16; to {fraction (1/7)} according to the example of most preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> compared with the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that various modifications (e.g., an arrangement having a combination of the features of the third embodiment and the fourth or the fifth embodiment) are possible, illustration and description of which are omitted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although TFTs are used as an example of switching elements in the embodiments described above, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, various types of switching elements, including bipolar type, MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) type, or more broadly, MIS (Metal Insulator Semiconductor) type, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> &lt;Embodiment of Electro-Optical Apparatus&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The level shifters described above may be used, for example, in a driving circuit of an electro-optical apparatus such as a liquid crystal apparatus. The electro-optical apparatus will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a schematic construction of the electro-optical apparatus according to this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the electro-optical apparatus includes a TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>arranged in a matrix form, TFTs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connected to the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and scanning lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and data lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to the TFTs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed. The pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed of transparent conductive material such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide). The scanning lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the data lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in a grating form so as to extend through the gaps between the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>arranged in a matrix form, as shown in the figure. The scanning lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are connected to a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the data lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are connected to a data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supplies scanning signals to the scanning lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for example, line-sequentially, and the data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supplies image signals to the data lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at predetermined timing with consideration to timing of the supply of scanning signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The electro-optical apparatus also includes an opposing substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> opposing the TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a common electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed substantially over the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The common electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed of transparent conductive material such as ITO, similarly to the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>described above. Furthermore, a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is an example of electro-optical material, is held between the TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the electro-optical apparatus, the TFTs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are controlled so as to turn on and off according to the scanning signals supplied via the scanning lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and image signals supplied via the data lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be applied to the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when associated TFTs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are turned on (active matrix driving). When the image signals are applied to the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, predetermined potential differences corresponding to the image signals are generated between the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (i.e., a predetermined potential difference is generated for each pixel). Accordingly, orientation of liquid crystal in the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> changes and transmittance of light changes accordingly, allowing display of a corresponding image. The light incident on the liquid crystal may come from, for example, a light source provided within the electro-optical apparatus, a fluorescent lamp external to the electro-optical apparatus, etc. Since both the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are composed of transparent conductive material, this embodiment operates as what is called &ldquo;transmission type.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the electro-optical apparatus according to this embodiment, a level shifter circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is provided as part of the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In the level shifter circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a plurality of level shifters, each configured as described earlier as one of the first to fifth embodiments, is provided respectively in association with the scanning lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. That is, in the level shifter circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, one scanning line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically connected to an output terminal OUT of one level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> configured, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and another scanning line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically connected to an output terminal OUT of another level shifter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be of an integral type, i.e., integrally formed on the TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the same manufacturing process for the TFTs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, etc. Alternatively, the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the data line driving circuit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be of an external type, i.e., implemented separately as a package that is to be mounted on the TFT array substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Both of these types are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Electro-optical apparatuses that uses thin-film diodes (TFDs) instead of the TFTs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as switching elements are also known, which are also within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and various modifications are possible within the gist or spirit of the present invention as read from claims and the entire specification. Level shifters and electro-optical apparatuses with such modifications are also included in the technical scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
