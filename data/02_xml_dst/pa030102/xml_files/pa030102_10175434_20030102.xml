<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Skids are well known in the art and have been used historically for transporting and supporting various articles. Standard skids made of wood or cardboard are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,204,583; 3,294,041; 3,430,585, 3,641,948 and 4,230,050. U.S. Pat. No. 3,405,666 describes a skid made from plastic. U.S. Pat. No. 6,058,852 describes a heavy equipment skid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the past, wireless communication equipment required a foundation system for installation. Previous installation systems did not have the ability to integrate prefabricated or temporary wireless equipment installations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There exists a need for a skid system for use in conjunction with wireless communication equipment. Heretofore this system has not been found in the art. Accordingly, the present invention is a novel skid system that eliminates the need for foundation installation. Furthermore, the present invention permits the prefabrication of equipment installation packages, thereby expediting installations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This invention provides for the prefabrication of wireless communications equipment assemblies to be used in permanent or temporary sites, while eliminating the requirement for a cast-in-place foundation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises a steel frame skid fabricated to dimensions matching the requirements of the equipment. The pre-existing equipment is fitted to the skid, which is wired to accommodate the equipment. The prefabricated assembly is then transported to its permanent location. This novel skid facilitates modular wireless equipment installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention is ideal for fast-paced installation schedules and temporary installations. It provides the user the ability to pre-fabricate installations, coupled with the ability to relocate equipment in a cost efficient manner. It also eliminates the need for of a concrete foundation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the present invention is a wireless equipment skid comprising a base member (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) having a top (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), a bottom (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>), a front end (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) and a rear end (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>); an upright member (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>); an extension member (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) and a removeable center panel (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) located on the top (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of the base member (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The base member (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is generally in a horizontal position, and the upright member (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is perpendicular to the base member (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The extension member (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is parallel with the base member (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The upright member (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is attached to the rear end (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) of the base member and the extension member (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is attached to the front end (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). A pathway (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) from the extension member (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) to the upright member (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) exists along the bottom (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the base member (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is a rectangular shape and the skid is made out of an epoxy-coated or galvanized tube steel fabricate frame. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the upright member (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) houses a wireless communication cabinet (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) and the extension member (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) houses a power supply cabinet (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). Said power supply may be a battery. Said extension member (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) may contain a gasket for attaching the cabinet. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> wiring system (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) exists along the bottom (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the base, through the pathway (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). The center panel (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) may be removed to access the wiring system (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). Said wiring system (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is connected from the battery cabinet (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) to the wireless communication cabinet (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). Both AC and DC power and telco are provided for. The top (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of the frame may be covered with diamond checkerplate. The diamond checkerplate can be &frac38; inch with a textured and non-stick surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a one embodiment, the wireless communication cabinet (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) may be the Motorola&reg; SC 611. The SC 611 is a digital cellular base transceiver station which includes a compact and self-contained unit that can be wall, pole, ceiling or rack mounted. The base station is small in size, light in weight and produces zero noise emissions, thus facilitating a modular installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Many improvements, modifications, and additions will be apparent to the skilled artisan without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as described herein. </paragraph>
