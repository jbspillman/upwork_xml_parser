<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for controlling charging and discharging processes with respect to a battery mounted on an electric vehicle, an electric powered carrier vehicle, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An automated guided vehicle (AGV) is an electrically driven vehicle which uses a battery as at least a part of a power source thereof. For example, AGVs are used as electric powered carrier vehicles for automatically carrying parts at assembly plants for a variety of products. A battery mounted on an AGV is, for example, a high-voltage battery pack including a plurality of rechargeable cells serially connected together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An AGV typically travels in a plant from a station as a starting point along a predetermined path and returns to the station so as to charge the battery mounted thereon. This operation is repeatedly performed. Electric power consumed by traveling along the predetermined path is usually as slight as substantially 10% of the battery capacity. The battery is not intended to be fully charged for safety reasons, etc., and therefore the battery is repeatedly charged and discharged such that the battery SOC (state of charge) is in a range from about 50% to about 60%, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the battery repeatedly charged and discharged so as to have a relatively narrow SOC range as described above, a charging memory effect is known to occur. The charging memory effect refers to a phenomenon such as an increase in voltage caused at the last stage of a charging process by repeatedly charging and discharging a battery in a shallow SOC range. In the case where the charging memory effect is caused in a specific SOC range, when an SOC value of the battery is increased so as to be higher than a value in the specific SOC range, a battery voltage is increased, thereby causing a reduction in charging efficiency, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a basic relationship between the SOC value of the battery and the battery voltage, the battery voltage has a tendency to increase according to an increase in the SOC value. Both in the range of a low SOC value which is in the proximity of 0% and the range of a high SOC value which is in the proximity of 100%, the battery voltage is significantly increased. The battery voltage has a slight tendency to increase between both ranges according to an increase in the SOC value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned AGV employs a system in which, when an excessive charging voltage is detected, a battery of the AGV is forcedly discharged for safety so as to cause the SOC value to be decreased to a lowest level in a range of the SOC values in which the charging and discharging processes are performed. For example, in the case where the range of the SOC values in which the charging and discharging processes are performed is between about 50% and about 60% and a battery voltage corresponding to about 70% of the SOC is set so as to be a highest voltage for charging the battery, the charging and discharging processes are usually performed such that the battery voltage corresponds to between about 50% of the SOC and about 60% of the SOC. When the charging voltage is increased to the predetermined highest level, the battery is forcedly discharged so as to have the SOC value of 50% which is the lowest level in the range of the SOC values in which the charging and discharging processes are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, when the charging memory effect occurs in the battery and the SOC value of the battery is increased so as to be higher than the SOC value at which the charging memory effect is caused, the battery voltage is rapidly increased, and therefore the battery voltage is erroneously detected as if the value of the battery voltage is at the highest level for charging the battery, so that the battery is forcedly discharged although the level of the battery voltage is lower than the highest level. As a result, the SOC value is decreased to the lowest level in the range of the SOC values in which the charging and discharging processes are performed. In this manner, the SOC value of the battery is forcedly decreased so as not to sufficiently charge the battery, and therefore repeating this operation might cause the battery of the AGV to be incapable of being sufficiently charged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case where the battery voltage corresponding to about 70% of the SOC is set so as to be the highest voltage for charging the battery, when the charging memory effect causes the battery voltage to be considered by a detector (not shown) as being increased to the highest voltage while the actual battery voltage corresponds to about 60% of the SOC, the battery is forcedly discharged so as to have the SOC value of 50%. As a result, the charging and discharging processes are performed with respect to the battery which is not sufficiently charged. In such a state, when the charging memory effect is caused again, the battery is forcedly discharged so that the charging and discharging processes are performed with respect to the battery which is not sufficiently charged. In this manner, when the battery of the AGV is forcedly discharged at a low SOC value due to the charging memory effect, the battery is not sufficiently charged, which may cause the AGV to be incapable of traveling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The charging memory effect can be prevented by performing a refresh charging and discharging process such that the battery is forcedly discharged so as to have the SOC value of 0% and is fully charged so as to have the SOC value of 100%. However, such a process is usually required to be repeated for a period of several cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing relationships between the number of cycles in the refresh charging and discharging process and the charging memory effect. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (a) refers to a case where one cycle of the refresh charging and discharging process is performed. In this case, the charging memory effect is caused when the SOC value is between about 50% and about 60%. Another relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (b) refers to a case where two cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes are performed. In this case, the charging memory effect is caused when the SOC value is between about 60% and about 80%. Still another relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (c) refers to a case where five cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes are performed. In this case, the charging memory effect is caused when the SOC value is between about 80% and about 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (d) refers to a case where six cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes are performed. Still another relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (e) refers to cases where seven and eight cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes are performed. In these cases, the charging memory effect is hardly caused. Therefore, it is necessary to perform the refresh charging and discharging processes six times or more so as to prevent the charging memory effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A similar problem is caused to a battery mounted on a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The battery for a HEV (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;HEV battery&rdquo;) stores not only electric power for driving an electric motor but also electric power generated in a regenerative cycle. The HEV battery is charged by a heat engine mounted thereon. Therefore, in order to prevent the HEV battery from being rapidly charged, as in the aforementioned case of the battery of the AGV (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;AGV battery&rdquo;), the HEV battery is charged and discharged so as to have a prescribed SOC value. Accordingly, there is also a possibility that the charging efficiency of the HEV battery can be reduced when the charging memory effect is caused. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to travel along a prescribed path in a plant, a warehouse, or the like. The AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as a power source and a battery control section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for controlling, for example, a discharging process with respect to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>.

The cell used in the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a sealed nickel-metal hydride battery. The battery control section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> stores input information with respect to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as SOC values, temperatures and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> travels in a plant from a station as a starting point along a predetermined path and returns to the station so as to charge the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided at the station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to a charging line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is connected to the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided at the station when the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is being charged by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The battery control section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to a charge control signal line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through which information is input/output from/to the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is being charged by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a charge control section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for controlling the charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected to a rectifier filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and receives three-phase alternating current (AC 200 V) input from an input terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the rectifier filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes a charge terminal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> connected to the charging line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The charge control section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a control signal terminal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is connected to the charge control signal line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The charge terminal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to a voltmeter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for detecting a voltage applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. An amperemeter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected between the charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the charge terminal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for detecting current applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted on the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> structured in the above-described manner is charged by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided at the station in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted on the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> usually consumes (discharges) a substantially fixed quantity of electric power during each journey along the prescribed path. After each time the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> travels along the prescribed path, the charging line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and charge control signal line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to the charge terminal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and control signal terminal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives three-phase alternating current which is input from the input terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and rectified by the rectifier filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is controlled by the charge control section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to apply the received current to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the charging line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The charge control section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> controls the charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> based on a signal output by the battery control section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the charge control signal line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this case, the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is intended to receive a greater quantity of charge power than a quantity of power discharged for each journey along the prescribed path, thereby increasing the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a substantially fixed quantity. For example, when the quantity of power discharged from the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for each journey of the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponds to 10% of the SOC, the quantity of charge power applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponds to 20% of the SOC. Accordingly, the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is increased by 10% through the charging process performed by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for each journey of the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As described above, the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is increased each time the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is increased so as to be between about 40% and about 100%, the charge control section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> controls the charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> such that the quantity of charge applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is zero, and therefore the charging operation performed by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is ceased. Accordingly, the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is discharged through the journeys of the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is sequentially reduced until the SOC value becomes 10%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the quantity of charge power applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set so as to correspond to 10% of the SOC and the quantity of power discharged from the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set so as to correspond to 20% of the SOC. As a result of this, each time the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged by the charging section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is forcedly reduced by 10%, for example, such that the SOC value becomes 10%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the SOC value is reduced to 10%, the quantity of charge power applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the charger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> corresponds to 20% of the SOC, thereby charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since a range of the SOC values in which the charging and discharging processes are performed sequentially varies and a range of the SOC values after the charging and discharging processes also sequentially varies, it is possible to prevent the charging memory effect caused by repeating the charging and discharging processes in a specific SOC range. As a result, an increase in a battery voltage due to the charging memory effect is suppressed, and therefore there are substantially no possibilities that a highest charge voltage upon the occurrence of which the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is forcedly discharged is erroneously detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Further, when repeating the charging and discharging processes in this manner, while the SOC value is in a range from 10% to 100%, by performing a refresh charging and discharging process once or twice, a significant refresh effect can be achieved, thereby ensuring that the charging memory effect is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a graph showing relationships between the SOC value and the battery voltage with respect to the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the method of charging and discharging according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (a) refers to a case where one cycle of the refresh charging and discharging process is performed by controlling charging and discharging of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to sequentially change the SOC value in a range of between about 10% and about 100%, forcedly discharging remaining power from the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the SOC value is increased to about 90%, and fully charging the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Another relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (b) refers to a case where two cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes are performed in the same manner as in the case of (a). One or two cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes provide significant refresh effects so as to prevent the occurrence of the charging memory effect. </paragraph>

Another relationship between the SOC value and the battery voltage denoted by (b) refers to a case where two cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes are performed in the same manner as in the case of (a). One or two cycles of the refresh charging and discharging processes provide significant refresh effects so as to prevent the occurrence of the charging memory effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, both the range of the SOC values at which the charging and discharging processes are performed and the range of the SOC values of charge power applied to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are preferably between 10% and 100%, and more preferably between 20% and 80%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described configuration in which the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is excessively charged until the SOC value of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is increased to a predetermined highest level, and charging and discharging processes are performed so as to apply zero charge power to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or excessively discharge greater power from the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> than charge power applied thereto until the SOC value is decreased to the predetermined lowest level. For example, the present invention can be configured such the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is excessively charged until a prescribed parameter, such as a highest voltage, a highest temperature, an increase in temperature per unit time (dT/dt), or current-voltage (I-V) of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, reaches its highest level, and then is excessively discharged such that power discharged from the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is greater than charge power applied thereto until the prescribed parameter reaches its lowest level. In any case, necessary information with respect to the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is suitably provided to the charge control section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the battery control section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Although the example of the present invention has been described above with respect to charging and discharging control of the battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted on the AGV <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the present invention is not limited to such a case and is applicable to a HEV battery which is charged and discharged in a prescribed SOC range in which the SOC value is less than 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the method for controlling battery charging and discharging according to the present invention, both the range of the SOC values at which the charging and discharging processes are performed and the range of the SOC values after the charging and discharging processes are sequentially changed, and therefore there is substantially no possibility that the charging memory effect is caused in the battery. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent erroneous detection of the highest charging voltage due to a charge voltage increased when the charging memory effect occurs. Further, it is possible to reduce the number of cycles of a refresh charging and discharging process required for preventing the charging memory effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed. </paragraph>
