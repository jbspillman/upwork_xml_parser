<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to technology relating to matrix type plasma display panel (PDP) and more particularly to technology relating to plasma display panel whose drive power supply is automatically adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since before, it has been well known that reactive power can be decreased in sustain period because if the resonance frequency of the sustain circuit is reduced in a drive circuit of the PDP unit, a current peak value at the time of resonance is decreased, so that effective current is also decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The sustain circuit mentioned here refers to a circuit for supplying electric power to a discharge cell in order to sustain discharge in a stable condition and the sustain period refers to a period in which light emission of the discharge cell is repeated by the sustain circuit so as to maintain the light emission condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventional technology about the driving circuit of the PDP unit has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-293135. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, if the resonance frequency of the sustain circuit is decreased, there is a trouble that it leads to changing discharge condition thereby affecting discharge margin and discharge intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-293135 does not describe any special matter about reduction of reactive power by operating the resonance frequency of the sustain circuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a drive circuit of the PDP unit capable of operating the resonance frequency of the sustain circuit so as to reduce reactive power in a circuit in the sustain period without affecting discharge margin and discharge intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A drive circuit of PDP unit including at least a pair of electrodes and discharge cells connected thereto, is further provided: a first path having a first switch and a first coil for applying voltage to the discharge cells; a second path having a second switch and a second coil for expelling the voltage applied to the discharge cells; and electric charge accumulating devices connected to the first path and the second path, wherein the inductance value of the second coil is larger than the inductance value of the first coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Consequently, according to the present invention, the resonance frequency at the time of fall, which does not affect discharge condition, can be reduced while maintaining a conventional resonance frequency at the time of leading, which affects the discharge condition. Thus, the peak value of current upon resonance can be reduced and effective current can be reduced, so that reactive power in a circuit in the sustain period can be reduced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an embodiment of a plasma display panel (PDP) unit of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanied drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an outline of the PDP unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The PDP unit comprises an input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, an address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A video signal inputted from the input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is converted to digital video data by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, processed to display data by the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and then supplied to the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> computes emission time corresponding to the intensity of illumination of video data and corrects the data by reallocation so as to generate display data. The frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is composed of, for example, a VRAM, which accumulates display data of a screen sent from the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and supplies it to the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> following synchronous signal from a control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which will be described later. The address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of a driving circuit having a DC power supply and switching device, and generates pixel data pulse to each discharge cell on the display panel based on the display data inputted from a frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and applies this to a column electrode Dj for every display line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is constituted of, for example, CPU, which outputs a synchronous signal to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are each constituted of a driving circuit having a DC power supply and switching devices as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> applies sustain discharge pulse IPx to an electrode Xj and sustain discharge pulse IPy to an electrode Yj based on the synchronous signal from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The operation of the PDP unit having such a structure will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A video signal inputted from the input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as an analog signal is converted to digital video data by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, processed to display data by the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and supplied to the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> accumulates display data sent from the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and supplies it to the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> following synchronous signal from the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A synchronous signal is separated from the video signal inputted from the input terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by a sync separation circuit (not shown), and then the control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs the synchronous signal to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the frame memory <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the basis of this separated synchronous signal. The control portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> drives the PDP by controlling ON/OFF of a switching device of the PDP driving circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is a panel driving device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Here, the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The drive sequence of the PDP unit will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A set of a sub-field (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> SF) has a reset period, an address period, and a sustain period. A set of a field, which is a drive sequence of the PDP, has several sub-fields, repeated N times, and thereafter a main erase process for resetting to a condition in which wall charge is erased by applying erase pulse respectively to all cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the reset period, all the discharge cells of the PDP unit are gotten into luminous discharge cell condition. In the subsequent address period, the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forms wall charge selectively to each discharge cell based on video signal so as to generate pixel data pulse which sets up luminous discharge cell or non-luminous discharge cell and apply this pulse to a column electrode of every display line. In the sustain period, sustain discharge pulse IPx and sustain discharge pulse IPy are generated alternately and applied to the column electrode X and column electrode Y alternately. As a result, in a luminous discharge cell in which the above-described wall charge remains, discharge light emission is repeated and then that light emission is sustained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The drive circuit of the PDP unit of this embodiment reduces reactive power in the circuits of the X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the sustain period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the structure of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which works as a panel drive device, is comprised of the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a reset pulse driver portion and a first sustain driver portion. The Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a reset pulse driver portion, a scan driver portion, and a second sustain driver portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The reset pulse driver portion applies a reset pulse respectively to all the column electrodes X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Xn, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Yn at the same time in the reset period. Consequently, all the discharge cells in the PDP unit are simultaneously discharged and excited to generate charged particles. After this discharge is stopped, a predetermined quantity of wall charges are accumulated on a dielectric layer of the discharge cells, so that luminous discharge cell condition is attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The scan driver portion applies a scan pulse SP to the electrode Yj in the address period so as to set the electrode Yj to a predetermined positive potential (Vh-Voff). This application is carried out synchronously with application of pixel data pulse DPj from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, of the cells of the column electrode on which the scan pulse SP is applied, discharge occurs in only a cell onto which pixel data pulse of positive voltage is applied at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The first sustain driver portion and the second sustain driver portion generate sustain discharge pulse IPx and sustain discharge pulse IPy alternately in the sustain period and apply it to the column electrodes X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Xn and the column electrodes Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Yn alternately. Consequently, discharge light emission is repeated in the light emission discharge cell in which the wall charge remains, and the light emission is sustained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A first sustain driver portion of the X-electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> contains a power supply B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, switching devices S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, diodes D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, coils L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which works as a charge accumulating device. According to this embodiment, the inductance value of the coil L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is larger than the inductance value of the coil L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A second sustain driver portion of the Y-electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> contains a power supply B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, switching devices S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, diodes D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, coils L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which works as a charge accumulating device. According to this embodiment, the inductance value of the coil L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is larger than the inductance value of the coil L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The operation of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the above described structure will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The column electrode Xj is an electrode at the column j (one electrode composing the j display line) in the column electrodes X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Xn and the column electrode Yj is an electrode at the column j (the other electrode composing the j display line) in the column electrodes Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Yn. The display panel cell is located between the column electrode Xj and Yj which form a pair and acts as a capacitor Co. The power supply B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> outputs a sustain voltage Vs<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The power supply B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputs a reset voltage Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The power supply B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> outputs a sustain voltage Vs<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The power supply B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> outputs a reset voltage Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The power supply B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> generates a voltage Voff while the power supply B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> generates a scan pulse voltage Vh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The operation of the PDP drive circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having such a structure will be described with reference to a time chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The drive sequence of this PDP describes the operation in a single sub-field. Subsequently, the reset period, address period, and sustain period will be described separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> First, in the reset period, a switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the X electrode driver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned ON, and at the same time, switching devices S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned ON. The other switching devices are kept OFF. When the switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is turned ON, current flows from the electrode Xj to a negative terminal of the power supply B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the switching device S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is turned ON, current flows into the electrode Yj from a positive terminal of a power supply B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through a switching device S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The potential of the electrode Xj is decreased gradually depending upon time constant of a capacitor Co and the resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that a reset pulse RPx is generated. The potential of the electrode Yj is increased gradually depending on time constant of the capacitor Co and the resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that a reset pulse RPy is generated. Then, the potential of the reset pulse RPx is saturated to the voltage level &minus;Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the potential of the reset pulse RPy is saturated to the voltage level Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This reset pulse RPx is applied to all the column electrodes X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Xn at the same time and the reset pulse RPy is applied to all the column electrodes Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Yn simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When these reset pulses RPx, RPy are applied at the same time, all discharge cells of the PDP are discharged and excited at the same time so as to generate charged particles. After this discharge is stopped, a predetermined quantity of wall charge is accumulated on dielectric layers of all discharge cells, so that luminous discharge cell condition is attained. When the reset pulses RPx and RPy are saturated after a predetermined time interval elapses, the switching device S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the switching device S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are turned OFF before the reset period is terminated. At the same time, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are turned ON and the electrodes Xj, Yj are grounded. The reset period is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next, in the address period, the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forms wall charge selectively to each discharge cell based on display data outputted by the display data generating portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, pixel data pulses DP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-DPm generate and the pulses set the cells the luminous discharge cells or non-luminous discharge cells. This process is applied to the column electrodes D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Dm for every display line. Pixel data pulses DPj, DPj&plus;1 are applied to the electrodes Yj, Yj&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the address period is started, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are turned OFF, and the switching devices S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are turned ON, and simultaneously the switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned OFF. If the switching devices S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are turned ON, positive potential (Vh-Voff) is applied to the electrode Yj. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The switching device S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned OFF synchronously with application of the pixel data pulse DPj from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned ON. Consequently, a negative potential indicating the voltage &minus;Voff at a negative terminal of the power supply B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is applied to as a scan pulse SP the electrode Yj through the switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Then, the switching device S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned ON synchronously with termination of the pixel data pulse DPj from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the switching device S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned OFF, so that a predetermined positive potential (Vh-Voff) is applied to the electrode Yj. After that, the scan pulse SP is applied to the electrode Yj&plus;1 also synchronously with application of the pixel data pulse DPj&plus;1 from the address driver <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> like the case of the electrode Yj. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the discharge cell belonging to the column electrode onto which the scan pulse SP is applied, discharge occurs only in a discharge cell onto which pixel data pulse of positive voltage is applied at the same time, so that wall charge of the cell erases. On the other hand, no discharge occurs in a discharge cell on which pixel data pulse of positive voltage is not applied at the same time although the scan pulse is applied and therefore, wall charge of the cell remains. In this case, the discharge cell in which the wall charge remains turns to a luminous discharge cell, while a discharge cell in which the wall charge is erased turns to a non-luminous discharge cell. When the address period is switched over to the sustain period, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are turned OFF and at the same time, the switching devices S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are turned ON. The switching device S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is kept ON. </paragraph>

Consequently, current, whose origin is an electric charge accumulated in the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, flows to the electrode Xj through a coil L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the switching device S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to charge the capacitor Co. At this time, the potential of the electrode Xj is raised gradually depending on time constant of the coil L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and capacitor Co.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> By such operation, the Y electrode driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> applies sustain discharge pulse IPy of positive voltage to the electrode Yj. In the sustain period, the sustain discharge pulse IPx and the sustain discharge pulse IPy are generated alternately and applied to the column electrode X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Xn and the column electrodes Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Yn alternately. As a result, the luminous discharge cell in which the wall charge remains repeats discharge light emission so as to sustain its light emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, the relation between the sustain voltage and sustain current in the leading period and the falling period will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing the relation between the sustain voltage and sustain current in the leading period and the falling period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Its left side shows the conventional relation between the sustain voltage and sustain current, while its right side shows the relation of the present invention between the sustain voltage and the sustain current. Further, its upper side indicates changes in the sustain voltage while its lower side indicates changes in the corresponding sustain current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If the leading period Ta is equal to the falling period Tb like the conventional drive circuit, a period from the start of the leading to the end of the falling becomes shorter. However, the absolute values at the peak of the sustain current in the leading period and the falling period are equal high values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Conversely, if the falling period Tb is longer than the leading period Ta like the present invention, the period from the start of the leading to the end of the falling becomes longer. However, the absolute value at the peak of the sustain current in the falling period is lower than that in the leading period. Consequently, effective current upon resonance becomes smaller, so that reactive power in a circuit in the sustain period can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the resonance frequency in the falling period Tb, which does not affect discharge condition, can be reduced while maintaining the resonance frequency of the leading period Ta which affects discharge condition under the same condition as conventionally. Thus, the peak value of current in the falling period Tb can be reduced so as to reduce the effective current. Therefore, reactive power in the circuit in the sustain period can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
