<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly a method of manufacturing a semiconductor memory device using a photoresist pattern formed by an argon fluoride (ArF) laser or a fluorine (F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) laser as a light source. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory device fabrication processes, photolithography is used to form patterns on a substrate with various materials. A photoresist, which is generally organic film forming polymers, is coated on a target layer, and exposed with a mask to induce photo-reaction in the photoresist, selectively. Then, the photoresist is developed and predetermined photoresist patterns are obtained. The photoresist patterns are mainly used as etch barriers during etching the target layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The photolithography has been moved ahead grew by leaps and bounds, from the beginning of mass production of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) which is representative of the semiconductor memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The development of photolithography has been accomplished by the development in the every filed of an exposing system, a photoresist material, a mask and a process. The advent of a lens having high numerical aperture and an alignment device in the field of the exposing, a chemically amplified resist (CAR) in field of the photoresist material, a phase shift mask and an optical proximity correction in the field of the mask and method using a tri-layer-resist, a bi-layer-resist, a top-surface-imaging and an anti-reflection-coating in the field of the process, serve as good example, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The initial exposure equipment is a contact printer, where a mask is directly contacted with a substrate and aligned by an operator who looks directly at the mask and the substrate with the naked eye. The contact printer had been developed to reduce the gap between the mask and substrate, and a proximity printer is developed. The proximity printer classified into a soft contact and a hard contact according to the amount of the gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the photolithography, the resolution is inverse proportion to wavelength of the light source. The early stepper adopting step and repeat method, the wavelength of light source has been shortened from 436 nm, i. e. g-line, to 365 nm, i.e. i-line. A stepper and another exposing system, such as a scanner type exposing device, using a deep ultra violet(DUV), for example, 248 nm of KrF excimer laser, have been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Photoresist patterns of which critical dimension(CD) are not more than 0.15 &mgr;m can be formed owing to the developments of an exposing device, photoresist material and other techniques used in the photolithography process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It can be expected to form photoresist patterns of which CD are not more than 0.11 &mgr;m by using a deep ultra violet(DUV), i.e. 193 nm of KrF excimer laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In case of using the DUV, the resolution and the depth of focus(DOF) are improved compared to the case of using i-line. However, it is difficult to control process conditions. In the photolithography using the DUV, the difficulties are caused by an optical problem owing to use of light source having short wavelength and a chemical problem owing to the use of the CAR. As the wavelength become shorter, the effect of CD swing becomes a serious problem because of the effect of standing wave. The effect of CD swing is a phenomenon of periodic variation of line width of the photoresist pattern, and the effect of CD swing is caused by the variation of the extent of interference between incident light and reflective light, which varies by a trifle thickness difference of the photoresist film or the sub-layer. In the photolithography process using the DUV as the light source, the CAR should be used to improve sensitivity, however the problems of the stability of post exposure delay (PED) and the dependence on the sub-layer are generated owing to the reaction mechanism of the CAR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The main problem of the lithography using the ArF laser as a light source is a development of new photoresist material. The photoresist for the ArF laser is also one kind of CAR, as the photoresist for the KrF, however the benzene rings should not be contained in the photoresist for ArF laser. The benzene rings have been used for improving barrier characteristic of the photoresist for i-line and KrF laser in the dry etching. In case that the benzene rings are in the photoresist for ArF laser, the absorption rate increases in the 193 nm, which is the wavelength of the ArF laser, that is, the transparent rate decrease, accordingly, it is difficult to expose the photoresist to the bottom thereof. Therefore, it is need to develop a photoresist having high barrier characteristic without the benzene rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, a photoresist having a CycloOlefin-Maleic Anhydride (COMA), a photoresist having Acrylate species and a photoresist containing both the COMA and the Acrylate species, which have been used for ArF laser, have the benzene rings therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in case of forming photoresist patterns by exposing the photoresist, in which the benzene rings are contained, with the ArF laser, the deformation or lumping of the photoresist patterns is generated when an etch process using fluorine-based gas as an etching gas is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is need to supplement the physical characteristic of the photoresist pattern, in which the benzene rings are contained and formed by exposing with the ArF laser, in order to improve barrier characteristic of the photoresist patterns in the etch process using the fluorine-based gas. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor memory device using a photoresist pattern formed by an argon fluoride (ArF) laser as a light source according to the present invention will be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E are cross-sectional views showing a process forming a contact hole by using a photoresist pattern as an etching mask, which is formed by an argon fluoride (ArF) laser beam or a fluorine (F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) laser beam as a light source in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as an example of a neighboring conductive pattern is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A hard mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a spacer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed on the top and lateral sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively and then an interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deposited on the entire structure. The hard mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the spacer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed with a nitride layer, and the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed with an oxide of advanced planarization layer, a boro phospho silicate(BPSG), a spin on glass(SOG), a high density plasma oxide or a nitride layer in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a mask layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed on the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The mask layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by depositing polysilicon, which has a good etching ratio for chlorine-based gases, at a thickness of about 500 &angst; to about 200 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, a photoresist is coated on the mask layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and exposed with a mask to induce photo-reaction in the photoresist by using an ArF laser beam or a fluorine (F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) laser beam as a light source. Then, the photoresist is developed and predetermined photoresist patterns are obtained, so that a predetermined portion of the mask layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the exposed mask layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is selectively etched by using the chlorine-based gas, such as a gas of Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Cl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, BCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, HCl, HBr, SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or the like, to expose a portion of the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that a contact hole is defined and a mask pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A is formed. The present invention employs an advantage that the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is formed by being exposed to the light source having wavelength of about 157 nm to 193 nm, such as the ArF laser beam or the F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser beam, has a good etching resistance against the chlorine-based gas rather than that of the fluorine-based gas, so that, in an etching process using the photoresist as an etching barrier, since the chlorine-based etching gas is employed, deformation of the photoresist pattern, which is caused by the etching process, can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, before the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed, the exposed interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is selectively etched by the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the mask pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A as an etching mask, so that a contact hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed to expose a surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the gate electrodes. At this time, the etching process is carried out by using a gas of C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>(x is from 1 to 10 and y is from 1 to 10) C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>(x is from 1 to 10 and y is from 1 to 10), O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Co or a mixture gas thereof as an etching gas. Thereafter, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed. The etching process of the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be performed before the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D, a</cross-reference> polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited on the entire structure to be filled in the contact hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and then a chemical mechanical polishing process or an etch back process is carried out for the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the mask pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A until the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed, so that a polysilicon plug <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D are cross-sectional views showing a process forming a contact hole by using a photoresist pattern as an etching mask, which is formed by an argon fluoride (ArF) laser beam or a fluorine (F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) laser beam whose wavelength are of 157 nm to 193 nm as a light source in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as an example of a neighboring conductive pattern is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A hard mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a spacer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed on the top and lateral sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively, and then an interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire structure. The hard mask <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the spacer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed with a nitride layer and the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed with advanced planarization layer (APL) oxide, boro phospho silicate glass (BPSG), spin on glass (SOG) or high density plasma (HDP) oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a mask layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed with an organic material at a thickness of 500 &angst; to 3000 &angst; on the interlayer insulting layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The mask layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, also, further plays a role of a reflection protection layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Next, a photoresist is coated on the mask layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and exposed with a mask to induce photo-reaction in the photoresist by using the light source of the ArF Laser beam or the F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser beam. Then, the photoresist is developed and a photoresist patterns are obtained, so that a predetermined portion of the mask layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A process forming the photoresist <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The photoresist for the ArF laser, such as COMA (CycloOlefin-maleic anhydride) or Acrylate, is coated on the mask layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 1000 &angst; to 5000 &angst; and then, before an exposure process, an electron beam irradiation process or an Ar ion implantation process may be additionally carried out to harden tolerance of the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the exposed mask layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is removed by selectively performing an etching process using a chlorine-based etching gas, such as a gas of Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, HCl, HBr or SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>with maintaining the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a temperature of about &minus;40&deg; C. to about 30&deg; C., so that the interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed and an region for forming a contact hole is defined. Also, a mask pattern <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A is formed. At this time, a gas of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Ar, He or Xe can be added into the chlorine-based gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, as the exposed interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is selectively etched by using the mask pattern <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A as an etching mask, a contact hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed to expose a surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the gate electrodes. At this time, a temperature of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is maintained in about 20&deg; C. to about 100&deg; C. The etching process is carried out by using at least one gas selected from a group of fluorine-based gases including C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>(x is from 1 to 10 and y is from 1 to 10), C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>(x is from 1 to 10 and y is from 1 to 10) and, also, the etching gas may include an argon gas, a helium gas or a mixture thereof. </paragraph>
