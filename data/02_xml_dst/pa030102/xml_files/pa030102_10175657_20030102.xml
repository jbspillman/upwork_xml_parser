<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Many areas of industry have to cope with the problem of conveying fluids in systems comprising tubular parts coupled together, whether permanently or temporarily, these parts consisting in some cases of flexible pipes or lines, usually elastomeric in nature (often silicone), which may or may not be reinforced with a textile structure such as a braid incorporated into their walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention has to do with a novel type of reusable coupling that can make such a connection. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, such connections are made by inserting a nipple into the end of the tube which is then crimped by an outer ferrule so that the wall of the tube is sandwiched between the two, and the nipple provides a support for the coupling parts of the mating means mounted at the outlet or inlet of the assembly to which the pipe is to be connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such an approach, which is found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,549,180 and FR 1 385 084, nonetheless has drawbacks in that the presence of a nipple inserted into the pipe significantly reduces the fluid pathway at this point, thus not only disturbing the movement of the fluid but possibly also, in some cases, resulting in a retention of the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has proposed a solution in accordance with the teachings of the abovementioned documents by which this problem can be solved. This solution is illustrated in the accompanying <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and provides almost perfect continuity of the inside wall of the tube with the inside surface of the coupling nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general terms, referring to this <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to make the coupling of the end of the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), a nipple denoted by the general reference (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is inserted into its end. The outer portion (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the said nipple forms an annulus designed to support the means (J) for forming the joint with the part to which the pipe is to be coupled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This done, a peripheral ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is then crimped around the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), thus fitted with the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), thus imprisoning the wall of the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To ensure precise positioning, the ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) comprises an inward annulus (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) capable of fitting into a peripheral groove (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) on the external surface of the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) during the crimping operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Although such an approach makes it possible to produce couplings in which the internal pathway includes no region of fluid retention, it is not possible to guarantee that the assembly is completely aseptic, owing to the fact that mould, bacteria and the like may sometimes settle in the connection region between the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the end (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) of the ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In its patent application WO 00/01974, the Applicant proposed a solution which not only makes it possible to produce a coupling that contains no region of fluid retention but which also makes it possible to obtain a completely aseptic assembly that eliminates all risk of infiltration from the outside of bodies such as mould, bacteria and the like, which could contaminate the fluid conveyed inside the system. This solution consists, in general terms, in interposing a peripheral seal between the extreme edge of the annulus of the ferrule and that of the outer wall of the groove provided on the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Such a solution is perfectly satisfactory in the case of fixed systems, but as it involves crimping, it cannot be used to produce couplings that can be disassembled rapidly, for example if a defective pipe requires changing. Moreover, by its very design, such a coupling cannot be reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The solution to this problem of producing a reusable, anti-binding and aseptic coupling is to be found in the teachings of French Patent 2 766 901 by the Applicant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although this solution is satisfactory in the case of non-reinforced plastic pipes whose walls can be compressed relatively easily, it is unsuitable for producing couplings for the ends of pipes having thick, virtually incompressible walls containing a reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To date, therefore, when making couplings on such thick-walled reinforced pipes, only crimped assemblies, of the type disclosed in WO 00/01974, provide mechanical characteristics that eliminate all risk of tearing, and eliminate the problems of retention and the risk of infiltration of contaminants from the outside. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In general terms, the invention therefore seeks to solve all the abovementioned problems while allowing the coupling to be assembled directly by the user in situ and the coupling component to be rapidly dismantled, as for example during a maintenance operation, whilst at the same time allowing it to be reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In general terms, the invention therefore relates to a reusable coupling adaptable to the ends of a tube and which comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> a nipple comprising a toothed end designed to be inserted into the tube, its inside diameter corresponding approximately to the inside diameter of the tube, the said end being continued by an annular surface external to the tube, at the end of which are the actual means of connection to the part to which the tube is to be connected; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> a peripheral ferrule mounted around the tube and imprisoning the latter in engagement with the toothed part of the nipple, the said ferrule comprising an inward annulus capable of fitting into a peripheral groove on the surface of the nipple, while a seal is provided at the location of this annulus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The coupling according to the invention is characterized in that the peripheral locking ferrule is radially compressible and is immobilized and fixed to the periphery of the tube by a &ldquo;connection&rdquo; assembly comprising two connectable parts mounted around the end of the tube on either side of the said locking ferrule, namely: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> a first part or &ldquo;outer sleeve&rdquo; positioned around the nipple and comprising on its rear face an annulus capable of bearing against one of the ends of the clamping ferrule and, on its front face, an internal cage forming a nut; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> a second part or &ldquo;clamping ring&rdquo; positioned around the pipe, downstream with respect to the clamping ferrule, the said ring comprising an external threaded portion that can be screwed into the threaded portion of the first part and an internal chamber capable of bearing against the peripheral surface of the ferrule, thereby crushing it and imprisoning the wall of the pipe, as well as pushing the inward annulus of the said ferrule into the peripheral groove on the surface of the said nipple, and imprisoning the seal between the said annulus and the bottom of the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Materials from which the various parts of which a coupling according to the invention is composed can be made are preferably stainless steel for the nipple and the outer sleeve of the connection assembly, while the radially compressible peripheral ferrule and the clamping ring forming the second part of the connection assembly will be made in an engineering plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Such a combination of materials eliminates any risk of binding during assembly and disassembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the compressible ferrule is made of plastic and comprises teeth on its internal face and along part of its length, its external surface having two oppositely tapering regions, the region facing the internal surface of the clamping ring bearing against a region of corresponding taper provided in the chamber of the said ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To make the said ferrule radially compressible, staggered slits are provided occupying at least part of the length of each tapering region of the compression ferrule. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">METHOD OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As indicated earlier, FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> illustrate one embodiment of a reusable coupling in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the remainder of the description, the same references as were used for the prior art illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be used to denote the same parts used in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it should be observed that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are drawn at full scale and illustrate an example of an embodiment for a coupling situated at the end of a flexible tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) having an inside diameter of 25 mm and a wall thickness of 6 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> meanwhile is an exploded view of the structure of a coupling after assembly around the pipe, shown at a scale of 2:1, the said pipe being omitted for clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious that the invention can be used on a wide range of tubes with inside diameters which can vary from a few millimeters to a 100 mm or more, and with wall thicknesses which may be greater than or approximately 8 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to the attached diagrams, the novel coupling in accordance with the invention, designed to be fitted to the end of a flexible, preferably reinforced pipe denoted by the general reference (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), is therefore composed of a nipple, denoted by the general reference (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the exterior part of which forms an annulus (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) designed to support joining means (not shown in the figures) for attachment to the part to which the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is to be coupled. This nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is therefore designed to be inserted into the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and comprises, along its length designed to be inserted into the said tube, a succession of teeth (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) the peripheral envelope of which has a diameter slightly greater than the diameter of the said tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Between this toothed region (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and the annulus (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) supporting the actual coupling means, the nipple comprises a groove (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) capable of accomodating a seal (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and the inward annulus (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) provided at the end of the peripheral ferrule denoted by the reference (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Such a nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) therefore has a general structure of the type known from the prior art as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Just as in the prior art, the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is held in position inside the tube by a peripheral ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), which is fitted around the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and imprisons it in conjunction with the toothed part (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) of the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> This ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) also includes at one end an inward annulus (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) capable of fitting into the peripheral groove (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) on the surface of the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), a seal (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) being provided at the location of this annulus, inside the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, in order that the ferrule is held and locked in position, the latter has a structure such as to be radially compressible. For this purpose it is immobilized and fixed around the periphery of the tube by means of a &ldquo;connection&rdquo; assembly comprising two connectable parts, denoted respectively by the general references (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>): these are fitted around the end of the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) on either side of the locking ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The first part (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), or &ldquo;outer sleeve&rdquo;, is therefore arranged around the front of the nipple and comprises, on its rear face (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), an open annulus (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) directed towards the longitudinal axis of the assembly. This annulus is capable of bearing against a peripheral groove (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) on the front face of the clamping ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). The diameter of the annulus (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is such as to allow the nipple to pass freely through it. In addition the sleeve (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) has an internal cage (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) forming a nut on its front face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The second part of the connection assembly consists of a ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) or &ldquo;clamping ring&rdquo;. This ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is positioned around the pipe (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), downstream with respect to the clamping ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). It has a threaded external portion (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) that can be screwed into the threaded portion (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) of the first part (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the nipple and the outer sleeve (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) are made of stainless steel, while the compressible ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and the clamping ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) are made in an engineering plastic, thereby eliminating all risk of binding during assembly and disassembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated, the compressible ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is therefore made of a plastic. It has teeth (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) on its internal face. Its external surface comprises two oppositely tapering regions (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). The rear tapering region (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) is intended to be brought up against a corresponding tapering region (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) on the inside of the clamping ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated, in order to make the ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) compressible, staggered radial slits are provided, occupying at least part of the length of each tapering region (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) of the compression ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As an example, the region (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) comprises four slits (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) having a width of 2 mm and a length of 10 mm, and being staggered at angles of 90&deg; with respect to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The region (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) comprises six slits (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) staggered at angles of 60&deg; with respect to each other. These slits also have a width of 2 mm and a length of 25 mm. These slits (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) are staggered axially with respect to the slits (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Lastly, the clamping ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) comprises means to facilitate the screwing together of the two parts (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). For this purpose, the end (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) of the said ring may include flats on its outer face for use with a spanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, as it can be seen in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, instead of providing flat faces on the clamping head (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>), it is conceivable to provide a number of grooves (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>), in which case the coupling would be tightened up using a tool having claws which would fit into these recesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The procedure for using the device in accordance with the invention will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The first phase is to place the clamping ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) around the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), where it can slide freely along it. The compressible ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) according to the invention is then also positioned around the end of the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The sleeve (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) is then placed around the end of the tube and covers the ferrule. This done, the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is forced in, so that the end of the tube (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) bears against the teeth (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) of the nipple and is positioned close to the wall defining the peripheral groove (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) in which a seal (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In order to lock and immobilize the assembly around the end of the tube, it is now a simple matter of using a spanner to screw the clamping ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) into the threaded portion (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) of the outer sleeve (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). During this operation, the tapering surface (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) of the ring (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) therefore presses against the corresponding tapering surface (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) of the ferrule, causing the toothed arms of this ferrule to bend and compress. When it can be screwed no further, the tapering region (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) of the ferrule bears against a slope on the inside of the sleeve (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), causing this region (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) of the ferrule to bend in and pushing the inward annulus (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) on the end of the ferrule into the groove (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) located on the nipple, in which the peripheral seal has already been placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Once the whole is fully assembled, the tube is rigidly held between the clamping ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and the nipple (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Also, since the ferrule (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is imprisoned between the peripheral shoulder (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the rear wall (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) formed by the inward shoulder of the ring (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>), there is a dual locking action that eliminates any risk of the tube being pulled out and gives the assembly mechanical characteristics that are at least equivalent, if not superior to, assemblies made previously by crimping, whilst at the same time allowing for the possibility of easily dismantling the said assembly should work need to be carried out. </paragraph>
