<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser device, a semiconductor laser array, and a method of aligning the device or array with an optical fiber. More specifically, it relates to a semiconductor laser device which is suitable as a signal light source for use in data communication, and easy to align with an optical fiber when a semiconductor laser unit is to be assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When a semiconductor laser unit which is to be incorporated into an optical communication system is assembled, a semiconductor laser device, which is a light source, and an optical fiber, which is a signal transmission line, need to be optically coupled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a semiconductor laser device having a layer structure in which predetermined semiconductor layers are stacked on a semiconductor substrate, a light emitting plane is normally a cleavage plane made by cleaving the layer structure. A minute part of the cleavage plane comprises an active layer, which forms a light emitting portion. The position of the light emitting portion cannot be recognized with the naked eye. Thus, when a laser device and an optical fiber are optically coupled, conventionally they are aligned in the following way: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> First, a semiconductor laser device is operated, and one of the end faces of an optical fiber is placed to abut on the light emitting plane of the laser device. Then, while light emitted from the other end face of the optical fiber is being monitored, positional relation between the laser device and the optical fiber are varied three-dimensionally. Then, the laser device and the optical fiber are fixed in the positional relation where the monitored light has maximal intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, this way of aligning is not necessarily industrial in that it is rather cumbersome and requires high skill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, study has been made of an aligning technique by which a laser device and an optical fiber can be aligned easily and stably and optical coupling can be made with high reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei 7-50449 discloses a semiconductor laser device which can be aligned with an optical fiber through visual observation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this semiconductor laser device, two active layers are arranged in a predetermined positional relation, in a semiconductor layer structure formed on a semiconductor substrate. The upper portion of one of the two active layers is buried under semiconductor layers and the part thus made of functions as a regular light emitting portion. Of the other active layer, only the upper portion is not buried under semiconductor layers, and a V-shaped groove which is recognizable with the eye is formed in a position corresponding to that upper portion. The part thus made of forms a non-light-emitting portion, and the V-shaped groove functions as a marker portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When this laser device is to be optically coupled to an optical fiber, first, through visual observation, an end face of the optical fiber is aligned with the bottom of the marker portion of the non-light emitting portion. Then, the optical fiber is displaced parallel, in the width direction of the laser device, by a predetermined distance. Thus, the optical fiber is aligned with the active layer of the light emitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this known technique, however, when crystals of semiconductor materials are made to grow in order to form a V-shaped groove (marker portion) which is a non-light emitting portion, abnormal growth can happen and polycrystals can be formed in the V-shaped groove. In that case, the V-shaped groove has a rough surface, which prevents the V-shaped groove from being clearly recognized with the eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, there may happen a problem that, when an electrode is formed over the light emitting portion, the electrode extends over the marker portion (V-shaped groove), which easily causes short-circuiting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of a layer structure of a laser device according to the present invention. First, referring to the drawings, how this example of a laser device is produced will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> First, for example, on the (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) plane of a p-InP substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a buffer layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of, for example, p-InP, an active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of, for example, GRIN-SCH-MQW structure (InGaAsP), and a cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of, for example, n-InP are stacked in this order to thereby form a slab layer structure. Next, by applying photolithography to the surface of the slab layer structure, dielectric masks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of, for example, SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>are formed in the form of stripes extending along the (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) plane. Then, by etching, two mesa stripes A<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>which are parallel to each other with a space of, for example, 50 &mgr;m distance are formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus, the buffer layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and dielectric mask <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and those of the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>are the same in thickness, respectively. Then, the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>will be formed into a light emitting portion, while the other mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>will be formed into a non-light-emitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Here, the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>are at the same level relative to the surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the p-InP substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The width of each active layer is 2 &mgr;m or so. The centerlines of both active layers, each bisecting the width of the active layer, run along the (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) plane and parallel to each other with a predetermined space (50 &mgr;m) distance. This space between the centerlines is determined uniquely by the distance between the dielectric mask stripes which are formed on the surface of the slab layer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This means that, at the time the mesa stripes A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>are formed, positional relation between the two active layers of the device are determined uniquely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, only the dielectric mask on the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is removed by etching to thereby have the cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> exposed. The dielectric mask on the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is left, in order to use it as a mask for selective growth. Next, crystal growth is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a buried layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of p-InP, a buried layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of n-InP, and a buried layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of p-InP are stacked in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> current blocking layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of p/n/p junction structure which is, for example, 2 &mgr;m in thickness is formed, where the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>has only both side portions thereof buried in the current blocking layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, from which the dielectric mask has been removed, has the upper portion and both side portions thereof buried under the layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of p/n/p junction structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At this time, the whole thickness of the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>as measured from the surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the p-InP substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is larger than the thickness of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>excluding the dielectric mask <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, by an amount corresponding to the thickness of the layer of p/n/p junction structure, i.e., the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (2 &mgr;m). Thus, the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>projects upward more than the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>does. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Next, the dielectric mask <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is removed by etching to thereby have the cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> exposed. Then, crystals of semiconductor materials having a refractive index lower than that of the semiconductor material (InGaAsP) of which the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made are made to grow over the entire surface of the device. Specifically, for example, a cladding layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of n-In P and a contact layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of n-InGaAsP are stacked in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the top face of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is buried under the two layers, i.e., the cladding layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the contact layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that a layer structure having a flat surface forms there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>becomes a trapezoidal mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which has the above-mentioned two layers added to the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Last, an n-type electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the contact layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a p-type electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on the backside of the p-InP substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the semiconductor laser device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the laser device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is 10 &mgr;m in width and 2 &mgr;m in height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, in the layer structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the low refractive index semiconductor layer which is formed directly on the cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>to have the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>buried under itself (the layer consisting of the n-cladding layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the n-contact layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is called a first semiconductor layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Between the first semiconductor layer and the cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>exists the layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which functions as a current blocking layer for the active layer of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. In the present invention, this layer is called a second semiconductor layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the laser device of this structure, first, when the n-type electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the p-type electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are operated, current is injected into the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the mesa stripe A<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the laser starts to operate, and a part A functions as a light emitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In contrast, since current injection into the active layer of the mesa stripe B<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is blocked by the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (second semiconductor layer), a part B functions as a non-light-emitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the entire top face of the laser device is observed with the eye, only the convex mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> looks bright at its top face and a little darker at both side portions thereof. Thus, a bright part with two dark lines which run parallel to each other with a space of about 10 &mgr;m between, on both sides of the bright part can be recognized as the two-dimensional shape of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The active layer of the non-light-emitting portion B is located at the center of the width of this bright part. Thus, the two-dimensional position of the active layer can be recognized with the eye, from above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Though the vertical position of the active layer cannot be recognized directly, it can be recognized in the following way: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> First, when the surface of the n-type electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is chosen as a reference point, the vertical position of the active layer in the non-light-emitting portion B can be easily recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when the surface of the n-type electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is chosen as a reference point, the top face of the active layer is at a level corresponding to the height of the reference point minus the respective thicknesses of the n-type electrode, contact layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, cladding layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, second semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and cladding layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and those thicknesses are all given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thus, the three-dimensional position of the active layer in the non-light-emitting portion B can be recognized through visual observation of the top face of the laser device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The active layer in the light emitting portion A is apart from the active layer in the non-light-emitting portion B, by a predetermined distance (50 &mgr;m) in the width direction of the laser device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the three-dimensional position of the active layer in the non-light-emitting portion B is recognized in the above-described way, the position of the active layer in the light emitting portion A can be recognized, because, if the position of the active layer in the non-light-emitting portion B is displaced parallel by 50 &mgr;m in the width direction of the laser device, that is the position of the active layer in the light emitting portion A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the semiconductor device is to be aligned with an optical fiber, first, the optical fiber is aligned with the active layer of the non-light-emitting portion B, through visual observation or pattern recognition. Then, the optical fiber which has been aligned with the active layer of the non-light-emitting portion B is displaced parallel by a predetermined distance (distance between the dielectric mask stripes). Only with this, the optical fiber and the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the light emitting portion A are aligned with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of another laser device according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In this laser device, the same layer structures B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>as that of the non-light-emitting portion B are so formed that the light emitting portion A and non-light-emitting portion B of the laser device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are located between them. Thus, the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the non-light-emitting portion B and the layer structures (non-light-emitting portions) B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>located on both sides of the non-light-emitting portion B have the same height as measured from the surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As compared with the laser device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this laser device is superior in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the case of the laser device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if it is turned upside down and bonded to, for example, a heat sink (junction-down bonding), stability may become worse due to the difference in height between the light emitting portion A and the non-light-emitting portion B (mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). In contrast, in the case of the laser device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the two non-light-emitting portions B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the same height provided on both sides of the light emitting portion A and non-light-emitting portion B ensure good stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that when the laser device is bonded, the indentations of 2 &mgr;m in depth between the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the layer structures B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>cause no trouble, since they are filled with bonding solder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Though it is preferable to form non-light emitting portions B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on both sides of the light-emitting portion A, it is acceptable to form a non-light emitting portions B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on one side of the light emitting portion A or non-light-emitting portion B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of another laser device according to the present invention. This laser device is an SAS (Self-Alignment Semiconductor) type laser device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In this laser device, on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of, for example, n-InP, a buffer layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of, for example, n-InP, an active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of GRIN-SCH-MQW structure (InGaAsP), and a first cladding layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of p-InP are stacked in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> On the first cladding layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, two second cladding layers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of p-InP are arranged parallel to each other with a predetermined space between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> One <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second cladding layers is buried in a current blocking layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, except its top face. That is, both side portions of the second cladding layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are buried in the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The other second cladding layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is buried under the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, including the top face and both side portions thereof, and the whole including the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second cladding layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>takes a convex shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> On the entire top face of the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a third cladding layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of, for example, p-InP, and a contact layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of p-InGaAsP are stacked in this order. A p-type electrode <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed on the contact layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while an n-type electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed on the backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this laser device, the third cladding layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the contact layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> form a first semiconductor layer of the present invention, and the current blocking layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forms a second semiconductor layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A light emitting portion A is located under the second cladding layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a non-light-emitting portion B is formed under the second cladding layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The part over the non-light-emitting portion B has a convex shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Thus, this semiconductor device according to the present invention is so formed that the convex part including the non-light-emitting portion, which includes an active layer at the same level as the active layer of the light emitting portion, projects from the surface of the other part of the semiconductor device. Thus, when the surface of the semiconductor device is observed with the eye or pattern-recognized, the part including the non-light-emitting portion is recognized as a shadowed portion. Thus, the non-light-emitting portion functions as a marker portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an example of a semiconductor laser array according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In this semiconductor laser array, light emitting portions A and non-light-emitting portions B as described above are arranged alternately on a single semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Between the light emitting portions A and non-light-emitting portions B, trenches C having a depth to reach the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are formed on both sides of each light emitting portion A, to keep the insulation between the light emitting portions A and non-light-emitting portions B. The pitch between the light emitting portions A is generally 250 &mgr;m or so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an aligning method will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a method of aligning a laser device of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with an optical fiber, after the laser device is junction-down bonded to a heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> First, a laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is junction-down bonded to a heat sink <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Here, the space due to the difference between the level of the surface of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> located under the non-light emitting portion B and the level of the surface of the part located under the light emitting portion A is filled with solder. Thus, the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is arranged in a horizontal position. An optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is placed in a V-shaped groove in a support table <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Then, the support table <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved in Y direction so that the central axis of the optical fiber will be at the level of the surface (bonding surface) of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, from under the heat sink, the two-dimensional shape of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pattern-recognized using, for example, an infrared camera, to thereby recognize the width of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. After the width of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is recognized, the support table is moved in X direction so that the central axis of the optical fiber will be at the center of the width of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thus, in respect of X direction, the optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has been placed in a position corresponding to the active layer of the non-light-emitting portion B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Next, the support table <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved in Y direction, by a predetermined distance, from the surface of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The distance by which the support table should be moved is grasped in advance, as the total thickness of the layers stacked on the active layer. Thus, in respect of Y direction, the optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has been placed in a position corresponding to the active layer of the non-light-emitting portion B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Last, the support table <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved in X direction by a predetermined distance. The distance by which the support table should be moved is grasped in advance, as the distance between the mesa stripes A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> With this movement, the central axis of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is aligned with the active layer of the light emitting portion A, accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a method of aligning a laser device of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> with an optical fiber. In this case, aligning is carried out in the same way as described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows another method of aligning a laser device according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this method, a heat sink <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as described below is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> On the surface of the heat sink <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a metallic maker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for positioning, which is smaller in width than the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of a laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is formed, for example, by photolithography. 50 &mgr;m apart from the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a V-shaped groove <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, in which an end portion of an optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is to be placed, is formed. In another area of the surface of the heat sink <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a metallization pattern <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is printed for bonding of the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In order to align the laser device, first, the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed in a predetermined position on the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed on the surface of the heat sink <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so that the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will be on the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then, positional relation between the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is observed from under the heat sink <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, using an infrared lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> looks relatively bright, while the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> looks dark. Since the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is smaller in width than the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the maker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are observed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. That is, it looks like the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located within the width of a bright line which is the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> While being observed, the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is displaced a little in Z direction, and when the maker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> comes to the center in width of the mesa <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is fixed. At that time, the center in Z direction of the active layer of the non-light-emitting portion B corresponds to the center in Z direction of the marker portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Then, when the optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is placed in the V-shaped groove <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the central axis of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comes in a position which is 50 &mgr;m apart from the non-light-emitting portion B. This means that the central axis of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is automatically aligned with the active layer of the light emitting portion A of the laser device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Thus, the laser device according to the present invention is easy to align with an optical fiber. Further, the laser device of the present invention is useful as a light source suited to be incorporated into a semiconductor laser unit. Further, in the process of producing the laser device of the present invention, abnormal growth such as formation of polycrystals, which has been mentioned with respect to the prior art, does not happen. Thus, the laser device stably has a good shape. Further, even when an electrode is formed over the light emitting portion, there is no risk of short-circuiting, which has been mentioned with respect to the prior art, because the active layer of the non-light-emitting portion is already buried. Thus, the electrode is formed stably. </paragraph>
