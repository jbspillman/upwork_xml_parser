<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a radio transmission apparatus and radio transmission method for use in a radio communication system, particularly to a multimode radio transmitter which can be used in a plurality of radio communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A radio apparatus for use in a radio communication system is divided into a transmission apparatus (hereinafter referred to as a transmitter) used for the radio apparatus to transmit a signal, and a reception apparatus (hereinafter referred to as a receiver) used for receiving the signal sent from another radio apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are various types of configurations of the transmitter and receiver, and the most suitable configuration to satisfy system requirement of the radio communication system at which the radio apparatus aims is employed as the configurations of the transmitter. Three types of configurations frequently used as a transmitter configuration will briefly be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (First Transmitter Configuration: Translation Loop) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a transmitter configuration called &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo;. The configuration also has other names such as &ldquo;Modulation Loop&rdquo;, but here the name &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo; will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo;, since a phase lock loop (PLL) is composed of a phase comparator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and second synthesizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an RF oscillator signal outputted from the first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a signal having remarkably little noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, the configuration of the &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo; can be used only in the radio communication system using frequency modulation such as a Gaussian-filtered minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An operation of the &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo; will briefly be described hereinafter taking the radio communication system (hereinafter referred to as GSM900) called global system for mobile communication (GSM) using a 900 MHz band as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> First, GMSK-modulated base band signals inputted via I and Q channel base band signal input terminals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are multiplied with a first local oscillator (LO) signal outputted from a first synthesizer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and frequency-converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal. Additionally, a 90&deg; phase shifter is omitted (this also applies to all the drawings hereinafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the IF signal outputted from the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is inputted into a phase comparator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> outputs a radio frequency (RF) oscillator signal corresponding to a voltage given from a loop filter. The RF oscillator signal outputted from the first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is inputted into the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> multiplies the RF oscillator signal outputted from the first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with a second LO signal outputted from the second synthesizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and ideally the frequency of the IF signal outputted form the first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the frequency of the IF signal outputted from quadrature modulator is the same. The IF signal outputted from the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is inputted into the phase comparator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The phase comparator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> compares the phase of the IF signal inputted from the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with that of the IF signal inputted from the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and outputs a voltage corresponding to a phase difference of the two signals to the loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> attenuates unnecessary high-frequency signals except direct current and low-frequency signals which are generated in accordance with the phase difference of the two IF signals. The first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> outputs the RF oscillator signal corresponding to the voltage outputted from the loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The RF oscillator signal outputted from the first voltage control oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is outputted from the first signal output connector for &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (Second Transmitter Configuration; Super-Heterodyne) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a transmitter configuration called a &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo;. An operation of the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; will briefly be described hereinafter taking the radio communication system called wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA) as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> First, the hybrid phase shift keying (HPSK) modulated base band signals are inputted via the I and Q channel base band signal input terminals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and multiplied with the first LO signal outputted from the first synthesizer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the IF signals are outputted from the quadrature modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the IF signal outputted from the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is inputted into a first IF variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the IF signal power is amplified. Next, the IF signals outputted from the first IF variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are inputted into a first IF band pass filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and unnecessary signals in the IF signals are attenuated. The IF signal is inputted into the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> multiplies the IF signal outputted from the first IF band pass filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the second LO signal outputted from the second synthesizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and outputs the RF signal. The RF signal outputted from the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is outputted from a signal output terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; can be used regardless of a modulation, and is broadly used in various radio communication systems. Moreover, the gain dynamic range of the IF variable gain amplifier can be largely, the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; is particularly used in the radio communication systems which are necessary a large transmission power control range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (Third Transmitter Configuration; Direct-Conversion) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a transmitter configuration called &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo;. An operation of the &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; will be described hereinafter taking the radio communication system called personal digital cellular (PDC) using a frequency of a 800 MHz band as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, first, the base band signals inputted via the I and Q channel base band signal input terminals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and multiplied with the first LO signal outputted from the first synthesizer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in order to frequency-convert to the RF signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the RF signal outputted from the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is inputted into a first RF variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to amplify power. Next, the RF signals which are outputted from the first variable gain amplifier for RF <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and from which the unnecessary signals are removed by a first band pass filter for RF <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are outputted. The RF signal outputted from the first band pass filter for RF <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is outputted from a signal output terminal for &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Similarly as the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; can be used regardless of the modulation, and is therefore used for the radio communication systems using various modulation. Moreover, since the amplifier and filter for the IF stage is unnecessary, a transmitter can be miniaturized as compared with &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo;. Therefore, the &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; is often used, when the radio apparatus is to be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As described above, for many of the conventional radio apparatuses, the above-described transmitter configurations have been designed exclusively for the respective radio communication systems, and an exclusive-use radio apparatus has been constituted for each radio communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> (Multimode Radio Apparatus) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In recent years, cellular phone users have increased all over the world, and various radio communication systems have been used. Therefore, there has been an increasing demand for a so-called &ldquo;multimode radio apparatus&rdquo; such that one radio apparatus can be used in a plurality of radio communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For example, when a transmission section of the &ldquo;multimode radio apparatus&rdquo; is realized by a conventional method of constituting the transmitter exclusive for each radio communication system and, for example, when the multimode radio apparatus can be used in three radio communication systems GSM/W-CDMA/PDC, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the same number of transmitters exclusive for the respective radio communication systems as the number of radio communication systems are arranged, and the transmitters are large-scaled. Additionally, each of the first and second synthesizers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> includes the same number of voltage control oscillators as the number of the corresponding radio communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there has been a demand for a convenient, small-sized and light-weight radio apparatus superior in portability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Here, in the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for use in the eighth embodiment of the present invention, the above-described frequency converter can be used which has the function of being capable of outputting the inputted signal as such without converting the frequency in addition to the function of converting the frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> To concretely describe the operation of the eighth embodiment of the present invention hereinafter, as one example, the uses in the three radio communication systems including: GSM900 suitable for the &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo;; W-CDMA suitable for the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo;; and PDC (800 MHz) suitable for the &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The operation of the eighth embodiment is different from the operation of the first embodiment only in the operation using the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo;, and therefore only this different respect will be described here. For the other operations, the first embodiment is referred to, and the description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> The base band signals of W-CDMA and PDC (800 MHz) of the I and Q channels, deviating in phase from each other by 90 degrees, from the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are frequency-converted in the quadrature modulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and outputted from the IF and RF band variable band pass filter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, similarly as the seventh embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> (Use in W-CDMA) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> the IF signals of W-CDMA outputted from the IF and RF band variable band pass filter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and having the unnecessary signals removed therefrom are outputted to the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> The frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> operates as the frequency converter for multiplying the IF signal of the W-CDMA outputted from the IF and RF band variable band pass filter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by the second LO signal of W-CDMA outputted from the second synthesizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and converting to the frequency of the RF signal of the W-CDMA, when the inputted signal is the IF signal of W-CDMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Concretely, the IF signal of W-CDMA with a frequency of 380 MHz is multiplied by the second LO signal outputted from the second synthesizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and having a frequency higher or lower than that of the RF output signal of W-CDMA of 1920 to 1980 MHz by 380 MHz, that is, in a range of 2300 to 2360 MHz or 1540 to 1600 MHz. Then, the RF signal of W-CDMA having a frequency in a range of 1920 to 1980 MHz is outputted. In this case, any one of high and low frequencies may be used as the frequency of the second LO signal of W-CDMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the output signal frequency-converted in the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is outputted from the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; signal output terminal <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> (Use in PDC (800 MHz)) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> The RF signals of PDC (800 MHz) outputted from the IF and RF band variable band pass filter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and having the unnecessary signals removed therefrom are outputted to the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> When the inputted signal is the RF signal of PDC (800 MHz), the frequency converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> operates to output the inputted RF signal of PDC (800 MHz) as such to the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; signal output terminal <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> without performing the multiplication of the signals as the operation of the frequency converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the eighth embodiment, the quadrature modulator and frequency converter heretofore disposed separately for GS, W-CDMA, PHS and PDC (800 MHz) are used in common. Moreover, for the IF and RF variable gain amplifier and band pass filter heretofore disposed separately for W-CDMA and PDC (800 MHz), the variable gain amplifier and band pass filter which can be used in common in W-CDMA and PDC (800 MHz) are used. Thereby, the number of composing elements is decreased. The transmitter can operate as the &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo; or &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo;. When this transmitter is used, the small-sized and lightweight transmitter of the &ldquo;multimode radio apparatus&rdquo; can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> Additionally, here, the uses of GSM900 as the radio communication system suitable for the &ldquo;Translation Loop&rdquo;, W-CDMA as the radio communication system suitable for the &ldquo;Super-Heterodyne&rdquo;, and PDC (800 MHz) as the radio communication systems suitable for the &ldquo;Direct-Conversion&rdquo; have been described. However, the combinations of the radio method and radio communication system other than the above-described combinations may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> As described above, needless to say, it is possible to appropriately combine and use the scope of the first to eighth embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
