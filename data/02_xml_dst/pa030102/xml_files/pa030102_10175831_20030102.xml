<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A laser beam machining apparatus forms blind holes at predetermined intervals in a workpiece by intermittently irradiating a laser beam from a laser nozzle to the workpiece while the laser nozzle and the workpiece being moved relatively. During the time the workpiece is subjected to machining, the electrostatic capacity between the support member and the laser nozzle is detected by an electrostatic capacity sensor while the workpiece made of conductive material is supported on the support member. The irradiation output power is controlled by a control unit which operates to vary the number of output pulses from the laser nozzle each time one hole is formed according to the result detected in response to variation in the thickness of the workpiece. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a laser beam machining apparatus for forming a tearable portion in a workpiece such as automotive instrument panel by irradiating a laser beam and a laser beam machining method therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Air bags for passenger seats of automobiles are generally placed on the inside of instrument panels. Moreover, an opening is formed in the instrument panel in a position opposite to the air bag and a cover plate is mounted over the opening; or otherwise there is formed a groove for use in cleaving a predetermined opening portion in the instrument panel though no opening is provided therein. In this case, the air bag is normally covered with the cover plate or the opening portion and when the air bag is activated, the cover plate is broken or the opening portion is cloven out of the groove so that the air bag is inflated outside the instrument panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the above structure of covering the air bag, however, the problem of spoiling the external appearance arises as the outward form of the cover plate or the groove of the opening portion is exposed on the front surface of the instrument panel. A further problem is that the reflection of the outward form of the cover plate or the grooves of the opening portion on the front window also puts a restraint on driving activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to deal with the foregoing problems, there has been proposed a method of forming a tearable portion by drilling blind holes at predetermined intervals in the rear side of an instrument panel to form a line of perforations. In this method, however, it is needed to form the tearable portion having a predetermined value of breaking strength over the whole periphery while a predetermined remain thickness is secured between the bottom face of each perforation and the front surface side of the panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, because instrument panels are curved and of uneven thickness when they are produced by molding, it has been difficult to drill blind holes in the instrument panel so that the remain thickness is secured uniformly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to deal with the problem above, there have heretofore been proposed laser beam machining methods as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 85966/1998 (the first prior art) and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-38479 (the second prior art). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the first prior art, when a tearable portion as a blind hole is drilled by the irradiation of a laser beam to a workpiece, the laser beam transmitted through the aperture is detected whereby to stop the drilling of the aperture when the power transmitted therethrough reaches a predetermined value. According to the second prior art, further, a laser beam is synthesized with a detection beam beforehand and the detection beam transmitted through an aperture is detected when the aperture is drilled by irradiating the laser beam to a workpiece whereby to stop the drilling of the aperture when the power transmitted therethrough reaches a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As set forth above, according to the conventional laser beam machining methods, the depth of apertures to be drilled is controlled so that the remain thickness is secured uniformly by detecting a small quantity of laser beam or detection beam transmitted through the cut part (aperture) of the workpiece. Therefore, a sensor for detecting the laser beam or the detection beam is needed to be provided on a supporting member such as a jig for supporting a workpiece to be subjected to machining and in a position corresponding to a laser nozzle in such a manner that the sensor is movable integrally with the workpiece on the opposite side of the workpiece, and this makes the detection device not only complicated in construction but also expensive. The problem in this case is that the necessity of adjusting the detection level before the workpiece is subjected to machining makes it troublesome to detect slight variation in the thickness of the workpiece. According to the first prior art, moreover, there is the possibility that as the laser beam is transmitted through the aperture of the workpiece, a small hole or a scar is bored or left in the base of the aperture in the form of a tearable portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to make constant the remain thickness, the output power of the laser beam has to be stabilized. For the stabilization of the laser beam, various factors or conditions such as the voltage supplied to the oscillator of a laser beam machining apparatus, the temperature of cooling water in an optical system and the ambient temperature of the machining apparatus also have to be definite. Actually, these factors and conditions are hardly kept constant and with the change of the optical system with time, moreover, the actual output power of the laser beam tends to vary in most cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In case where laser beam machining is carried out while the output power of the laser beam remains variable, the remain thickness of a workpiece also varies and this may result in impeding development of cleavage when the air bag is inflated, thus making small holes or leaving scars in the workpiece because a laser beam is allowed to pass through the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to compensate for the variable output power of the laser beam, there has been proposed the art described in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 278687/1988 (the third prior art). In this prior art, the output power of a pulsed laser beam following a reference pulse oscillated at a predetermined fundamental frequency as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is detected pulse-to-pulse and the output power is integrated by an integration circuit. Then the integrated value is compared with a reference value whereby to decide the error therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, though discharge time is required for the integration circuit when the output of the pulsed laser beam is integrated, the discharge time is difficult to secure because the output OFF time of the pulsed laser beam oscillated at a high speed of 5 KHz, for example, is too short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is conceivable to shorten the time constant of the integration circuit but as is obvious from an integral value <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the oscillation noise of the pulsed laser beam is detected. In case where the time constant is set longer, on the other hand, the discharge time of the integration circuit would not be secured as stated above. Consequently, a value widely different from the actual output power value is monitored and the laser output power cannot be detected accurately according to the prior art method. When the prior art method is applied to forming a tearable portion in the instrument panel, it becomes impossible to control the laser output power and this results in difficulty in making constant the remain thickness of the panel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A first object of the invention made with a special attention directed to the foregoing problems existing in the prior art is to provide a laser beam machining apparatus for ensuring that slight variation in the thickness of a workpiece is made detectable by a detection device which is simple in construction and producible less costly and for accurately drilling perforations in a panel while the remain portion of the panel base secures the predetermined thickness, and a laser beam machining method therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, a second object of the invention is also to provide a laser beam machining apparatus for making constant the remain thickness of a panel base by allowing the value of a laser beam by pulse oscillation to be accurately securable and a laser beam machining method therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to accomplish the first object, according to a first aspect, there is provided a laser beam machining apparatus for forming a blind hole in a workpiece by the irradiation of a laser beam from a nozzle to a rear surface of the workpiece while moving a machining head having the nozzle and the workpiece relatively, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> a workpiece support member made of conductive material for supporting and fixing the workpiece; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> a distance detection unit provided in the machining head and detecting the electrostatic capacity of a distance with a surface of the workpiece support member as a reference; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> a control unit controlling the laser beam in response to the electrostatic capacity which varies along with the thickness of the workpiece disposed between the workpiece support member and the distance detection unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the first aspect of the invention, a detection device simple in construction is producible less costly contrary to the prior art in which the laser beam or detection beam transmitted through the blind hole of the workpiece is detected. Moreover, it is not only ensured to make detectable slight variation in the thickness of the workpiece but also possible to accurately form the blind hole while the predetermined remain thickness of the bottom face of the panel base is secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the invention, in the laser beam machining apparatus according to the first aspect, the laser output power by pulse oscillation is controlled in response to variation in the electrostatic capacity while the nozzle and the workpiece are moved relatively with a predetermined distance between the workpiece support member and the distance detection unit being made constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the second aspect, the depth of the drilling hole can be adjusted easily and accurately by setting the number of oscillated pulses of the laser beam in response to variation in the electrostatic capacity. Further, many perforations are formable at the predetermined intervals while the predetermined remain thickness of the panel base is secured, which is fit for use in providing an opening for an air bag in an instrument panel for covering the air bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the invention, in the laser beam machining apparatus according to the first aspect, the distance detection unit is provided to the nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the invention described in the third aspect, no special mount need not be provided for the distance detection unit, which is made simple in construction, whereby the accessibility of the nozzle to the workpiece is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a laser beam machining method for forming a blind hole in a workpiece by irradiating a laser beam from a nozzle to a rear surface of the workpiece while moving a machining head having the nozzle and the workpiece relatively, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> fixing the workpiece to a workpiece support member made of conductive material; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> detecting the electrostatic capacity of a distance with a surface of the workpiece support member as a reference; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> controlling the laser output power by pulse oscillation in response to the electrostatic capacity which varies along with the thickness of the workpiece disposed on the workpiece support member, so that the bottom portion of the hole has a predetermined thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the same function as what is described in the first aspect can be retained according to the invention described in the fourth aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to the fifth aspect of the invention, the laser beam machining method according to the fourth aspect, further comprises the step of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> performing a peripheral groove by oscillating pulses intermittently at predetermined intervals when the machining head and the workpiece are moved relatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the same function as what is described in the second aspect can be retained according to the invention described in the fifth aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the sixth aspect of the invention, the laser beam machining method according to the fourth aspect, further comprises the step of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> adjusting the drilling depth by controlling the laser output power in response to the number of pulses of the laser output by pulse oscillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to accomplished the second object, according to a seventh aspect of the invention, there is provided a laser beam machining apparatus of irradiating a laser beam by pulse oscillation from a nozzle to a rear surface of a workpiece while moving the nozzle and the workpiece relatively, so that blind holes are lined up in the workpiece with remain portions in a front surface side of the workpiece, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> a thickness detection unit detecting the thickness of the workpiece, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> an output power control unit controlling the output power of the laser beam in response to the result detected by the thickness detection unit so that the irradiation of the large power laser beam is switched to the irradiation of a small power laser beam after the irradiation of the large power laser beam at each perforation; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> a laser beam detection unit detecting the actual output power of the laser beam when the large power laser beam is irradiated, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> an adder adding the output power detected by the laser beam detection unit; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> an adjusting unit adjusting the output power of the small power laser beam irradiated after the irradiation of the large power laser beam to conform to a command value in response to the result added by the adder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the seventh aspect of the invention, machining blind holes with the remain portion can be formed in the workpiece for machining the tearable portion by the irradiation of the laser beam by pulse oscillation. Then the machining blind holes are continuously lined up in the form of the tearable portion along the surface of the workpiece so as to form a groove-like tearable portion. In this case, the small power laser beam by pulse oscillation is used to machine the blind holes after the large power laser beam thereby is used to machine the blind holes and the number of pulses of the small power laser beam is so adjusted as to conform to the command value in accordance with the laser beam output by the large power laser beam. Consequently, even though an error in the depth of the blind hole is made because of the large power pulsed laser beam, the error can be rectified at the time of drilling a hole by means of the small power laser beam, so that the remain thickness of the bottom face of the blind hole is uniformized. As the small power laser beam is used to drill holes after the large power laser beam is used to drill holes, the opening side of each hole is widely formed. Hence, inactive gas and swarfs of the workpiece are smoothly discharged, whereby the drilling operation can be performed precisely and efficiently. In making a decision on the laser beam output power, further, the actual output power can be accurately calculated only by adding the pulse-to-pulse power of the laser beam by pulse oscillation. On the basis of the accurate power value, the drilling depth, that is, the accurate remain thickness of the panel base can be secured. Moreover, the depth of the blind holes is made adjustable by adjusting the laser beam output power by pulse oscillation in response to the thickness of the workpiece and even though the thickness of the workpiece varies, the uniform thickness of the remain portion of the panel base can be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to an eighth aspect of the invention, in the laser beam machining apparatus according to the seventh aspect, the thickness detection unit includes an electrostatic capacity sensor provided at the front end of the nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in comparison with a case where the laser beam transmitted through the workpiece is detected, it is ensured that the thickness of the workpiece is detectable without cause through-holes to appear in the workpiece. Moreover, the sensor is not needed to be installed on both sides of the workpiece and this makes the laser beam machining apparatus simple in construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to a ninth aspect of the invention, in the laser beam machining apparatus according to the seventh aspect, the irradiation power of the small power laser beam at each drilling is set in a range between 70% or lower and 20% or higher of the irradiation power of the large power laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the invention described in the ninth aspect, since the small-output irradiation power is sufficiently lower than the large-output irradiation power, the depth of the blind hole is made adjustable by the small power laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to a tenth aspect of the invention, there is provided a laser beam machining method of irradiating a laser beam by pulse oscillation from a nozzle to a rear surface of a workpiece while moving the nozzle and the workpiece relatively, so that blind holes are lined up in the workpiece with remain portions in a front surface side of the workpiece, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> detecting the thickness of the workpiece; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> switching the irradiation of a large power laser beam to the irradiation of a small power laser beam after the irradiation of the large power laser beam at each perforation in response to the detected result of the thickness of the workpiece; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> detecting the actual output power of the laser beam when the large power laser beam is irradiated; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> adding the detected output power; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> adjusting the output power of the small power laser beam irradiated after the irradiation of the large power laser beam to conform to a command value in response to the added result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the same effect as what is described in the seventh aspect is achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to an eleventh aspect of the invention, in the laser beam machining method according to the tenth aspect, the output power of the large power laser beam is corrected so that the output power thereof conforms to the command value in response to the added result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as the large power laser beam causing the drilling depth to be great is an object for correction, the depth of the holes can effectively be corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to a twelfth aspect of the invention, in the laser beam machining method according to the tenth aspect, the irradiation power of the small power leaser beam at each perforation is set in a range between 70% or lower and 20% or higher of the irradiation power of the large power laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the same effect as what is described in the ninth aspect is achievable according to the invention described in the twelfth aspect.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> &lt;First Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In a laser beam machining apparatus as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> according to the first embodiment of the invention, a support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forming a jig made of conductive material is disposed on a table <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is moved by a driving mechanism (not shown) in the directions of X and Y. A workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed and fixedly supported on the upper surface of the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by air suction (not shown). According to this embodiment of the invention, the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is an instrument panel used for covering an air bag (not shown) for an automotive passenger seat as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor (not shown) to be disposed opposite to the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and controlled so that it is movable close to and away from the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and also tiltable with respect thereto. Moreover, a laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is projected from the lower portion of the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Further, the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> including the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are moved relatively in the directions of X and Y with a predetermined vertical distance L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> held therebetween, whereby the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to a predetermined perforation position on the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a laser beam is irradiated from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by pulse oscillation to the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> under the control of a control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Then the laser beam is guided to the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and irradiated therefrom intermittently at predetermined intervals onto the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. According to this embodiment of the invention, it has been arranged that a number of tearable portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>such as blind holes are machined by the laser beam in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Consequently, a peripheral groove <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a whole is formed on the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> indicating W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in an enlarged manner, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> oscillates and outputs a reference pulse with a predetermined frequency. And, the reference pulse is fed into the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and simultaneously on-off signals are sent from the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. According to the reference pulse and the on-off signals, a laser beam having the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding to the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal is intermittently supplied from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are increased or decreased respectively with the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal so as to control the laser output power. Moreover, the width of one pulse and pulse-to-pulse distance of the laser beam is dependent on the reference pulse. Since many pulses are oscillated in response to the moving rate of the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by setting the output pulse frequency at as high as 5,000 Hz, for example, each of the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal acts as what is used to drill one hole. Thus, the tearable portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having depths L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> each corresponding to the number of output pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed by the laser beam in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The base of the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed of insulating material and a first electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed on the inner peripheral face of the nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by coating or the like, whereas a second electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is similarly formed on the outer peripheral face thereof by coating or the like. An electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as a detecting unit is connected to the first electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the second electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When each blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed, the electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> detects the electrostatic capacity between the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the detected result is fed into the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although an electrostatic capacity sensor has heretofore been utilized for measuring the distance quantity between metallic materials, a non-metallic material has also been held between the metallic materials in order to clarify the variation of the electrostatic capacity therebetween from the thickness of non-metallic material. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> detection voltage is obtained based on the electrostatic capacity corresponding to variation in the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> An input unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such as an input panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is intended to manually input various kinds of data and commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and stored with various kinds of data for use in controlling the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by means of the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores, in the form of a table, for example, machining position data for the plurality of blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be formed in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, relative data on the detection voltage of the electrostatic capacity, the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal out of the on-off signals and the number of output pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives the detected result of the electrostatic capacity from the electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at the time each blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by laser beam machining, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sets the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal out of the on-off signals directed to the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> according to the relative data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. With this setting, the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the laser beam supplied from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is changed, whereby the irradiation output power of the laser beam is so controlled as to be increased or decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the machining position decreases, voltage of large electrostatic capacity is detected. On the basis of the detection voltage, the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal out of the on-off signals are set small and this results in outputting a laser beam having a smaller number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a smaller depth L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed. As the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the machining position increases, on the contrary, the detection voltage of a small electrostatic capacity is produced. On the basis of the detection voltage, the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal out of the on-off signals are set large and this results in outputting a laser beam having a greater number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a greater depth L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed. In other words, the drilling depth L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is adjusted by increasing or decreasing the number of pulses. Consequently, even though the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> varies, desired depth can be set to each blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, whereby it is possible to secure the uniform remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base in the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Further, program data shown by a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, as will be described below, is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The operation of a laser beam machining apparatus as mentioned above will now be described by reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The program stored in the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is conducted under the control of the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as shown in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When the laser beam machining is started in the laser beam machining apparatus, the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to a programmed position above the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and disposed in such a condition that a predetermined distance L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided therebetween (Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the distance between the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is kept having a specified value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In this condition, the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> including the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> used to support the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are moved relatively, so that the laser beam machining of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is started as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). In this case, the electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> detects electrostatic capacity in a condition that the position of the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> corresponds to the machining position of one blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and detection voltage corresponding to the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fed into the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the detection voltage of the electrostatic capacity, the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal out of the on-off signals directed to the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are set. Therefore, the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the laser beam supplied from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are set in response to the respective widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal (Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). Further, the laser beam having the set number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sent from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is irradiated from the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, whereby the blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed while the predetermined remain thickness of the panel base is secured (Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). In this case, the greater the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the deeper the holes are formed, whereas the smaller the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the shallower the holes are formed. In case where the detected thickness of each hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is great, control is performed so that the set values of the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, whereas in case where the detected thickness thereof is small, control is performed so that the set values of the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> decreases. Consequently, the remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is kept constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Upon termination of formation of each blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, whether or not the presence of the next blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the machining position data is decided (Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). In making this decision, Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is followed again when the next blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>exists and the operation at Steps S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is repeated whereby to form a plurality of blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the predetermined remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being secured at the predetermined intervals. When the next blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is absent in the machining position data, the laser-beam operation with respect to one workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is terminated (Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the following effect is obtained according to this embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In this laser beam machining apparatus, the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixedly supported on the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of conductive material when the tearable portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed at the predetermined intervals in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by irradiating the laser beam from the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereto. In this condition, the electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> detects the electrostatic capacity between the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. On the basis of the detected results, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> performs controlling of the radiation output power of the laser beam from the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the laser output power thereof is varied each time one blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the provision of the detector on the side of the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be dispensed with contrary to the prior art in which the laser beam or detection beam transmitted through the tearable portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is detected, whereby a detection device simple in construction is producible less costly. Moreover, it is not only ensured to make detectable slight variation in the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> but also possible to accurately form tearable portions in a panel while the predetermined remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is secured. Moreover, any scar is never left in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> since no transmitted light for detection is needed to be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In this laser beam machining apparatus, the irradiation output power of the laser beam controlled by the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> depends on the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In other words, since the number of pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of pulses P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the laser beam are variably set according to the detected results of electrostatic capacity, the tearable portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can accurately be formed with the predetermined remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In this laser beam machining apparatus, a panel for covering an automotive air bag has been referred to as the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the external appearance is restrained from being spoiled when the tearable portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed at the predetermined intervals in the rear of the panel used to cover the air bag because small holes or scars are left in the surface side of the panel. Thus, a high-quality panel can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> &lt;Modified Examples of the First Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The following modification can be made to the first embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the invention, the number of output pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the irradiation output power of the laser beam controlled by the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set changeable. On the other hand, the output power or output frequency of a laser beam as the irradiation output power of the laser beam is set changeable instead of the number of output pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the invention, moreover, the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> subjected to the laser beam machining is an instrument panel for covering the air bag of an automobile. On the other hand, the invention is applied to forming grooves in a panel for covering an air bag to be incorporated in a steering wheel or any industrial material other than an instrument panel free from machining scars left in its surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the invention, machining position data on the plurality of blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, relative data on the detection voltage of the electrostatic capacity, the widths W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ON signal out of the on-off signals and the number of output pulses P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are stored in the form of a table. Further, these items of data are sequentially read out whereby to set the number of output pulses intended for each blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. On the other hand, instead of this, the number of output pulses for each blind hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is arranged so that it is computed in accordance with the level of the detection voltage of the electrostatic capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the invention, the laser beam has been irradiated intermittently to the workpiece so as to secure panel strength. However, a peripheral groove is formed by irradiating a laser beam continuously depending on the machining purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The same effect as what is achievable according to the first embodiment of the invention is also obtainable even when the arrangements as stated above are additionally made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> &lt;Second Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a laser beam machining apparatus according to the second embodiment. Since respective constructions of a support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forming a jig and a laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are substantially identical with those of the first embodiment, these detailed descriptions are omitted in this embodiment. Further, a workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be machined is an instrument panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> as well as the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A plurality of mirrors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a focusing lens <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are disposed between the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that a laser beam path is formed between the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. One of the mirrors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is used as a half mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and part of the laser beam is passed through the half mirror. A detection sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as a laser beam detection unit is disposed on an optical transmission path and the actual output power of a laser beam by pulse oscillation from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> controls the operation of the whole laser beam machining apparatus, to say nothing of the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and stored with various kinds of data and programs. The control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> form a correction unit, an adjusting unit and an output power control unit. Under the control of the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> according to the various kinds of data and programs stored in the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the laser beam is supplied from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and irradiated to the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed by the laser beam so that the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a predetermined remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. When the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are moved relatively in the directions of X and Y, a plurality of blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are continuously formed along the surface of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and by forming the continuous cut parts intermittently, a tearable portion in the form of perforations is formed in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> reference pulse having a fundamental frequency of (e.g., 5 KHz), an ON signal, an OFF signal and a switching signal are supplied from the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. When the ON signal is output, the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> oscillates a continuous pulsed large power beam in accordance with the reference pulse. When the switching signal is output, the oscillated laser beam is switched to the small power laser beam at a predetermined ratio to the large power laser beam. According to this embodiment of the invention, the small-output power is 50% of the large-output power. When the OFF signal is output, the laser beam output by small-output pulse oscillation is stopped. The number of pulses of the large power laser beam and that of the small power laser beam are set beforehand. However, the number of pulses of the large power laser beam and that of the small power laser beam are, as will be described later, set or changed differently under the control of the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The laser beam detection sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used to detect the output power of the large power laser beam. Further, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> computes drilling depth per pulse of the large power laser beam according to the detected output power of the large power laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with an adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, into which the output power of a large power laser beam detected by the detection sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is added, and the added value is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adjusts the output timing of the OFF signal according to the result of the output added by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the output value of a small power laser beam following the output power of the large power laser beam is corrected by adjusting the output timing of the OFF signal. According to this embodiment of the invention, the output value of the small power laser beam includes at least one of the pulse frequency of the laser beam, peak power of each pulsed laser beam and the number of pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As well as the first embodiment, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adjusts the output timing of a switching signal based on the detected results of an electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As will be described below, according to the second embodiment of the invention, the depth of about 80% of blind hole is defined by the large power laser beam, whereas the depth of the rest is defined by the small power laser beam. Consequently, the output power of the large power laser beam is set in response to the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adjusts the output timing of the switching signal for use in drilling the following hole on the basis of a drilling quantity per pulse of the large power laser beam as well as the value added by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> whereby to correct the value of the following large power laser beam by pulse oscillation. According to this embodiment of the invention, the output value of the large power laser beam includes at least one of the pulse frequency of the laser beam, peak power of each pulsed laser beam and the number of pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A thermoelectric power monitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is disposed in one corner portion of the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The thermoelectric power monitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is used to measure the intensity of the laser beam on receiving the irradiation of the laser beam before the start of machining and during the work arrangements are made. The control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives detection signals from the thermoelectric power monitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and decides the difference between the command value of intensity of the laser beam and the actual output power value of the intensity thereof. Further, the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adjusts the output power level of the pulse-to-pulse laser beam according to the decision so that the output power level of the actual intensity becomes closer to the command value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> An input unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such as an input panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is intended to manually input various kinds of data and commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given of a laser beam machining method through the operation of the laser beam machining apparatus thus configured according to the second embodiment of the invention by reference to a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> proceeds by executing the program stored in the memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> under the control of the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> When the laser beam machining is started, the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to a programmed position above the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and disposed in such a condition that a predetermined distance L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided therebetween (Step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the distance between the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is kept having a specific value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In this condition, the laser head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> including the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> used to support the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are moved relatively in the directions of X and Y, so that the laser beam machining of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is started (Step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). In this case, electrostatic capacity is detected first by the electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> while the position of the laser nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> corresponds to the machining position of one hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and detection voltage corresponding to the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fed into the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the detection voltage of the electrostatic capacity, the output power of the large power laser beam, that is, the number of pulses, for example, out of the output powers of the laser beam by pulse oscillation is set and corrected by the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (Steps S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). At this time, the number of pulses of the small power laser beam is predetermined. In other words, the number of pulses of the large power laser beam is set in response to the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> detected by the electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that the remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base becomes constant at Steps S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as is obvious from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Incidentally, according to this embodiment of the invention, a drilling ratio is pre-set at standard values such that blind holes are machined by means of the large power laser beam to the extent of 80% of the drilling depth and machined by means of the small power laser beam to the extend of 20% thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Then the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs an ON signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and the large power laser beam by pulse oscillation having the number of reference pulses at the fundamental frequency is irradiated to the drilling position of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) whereby to start the operating of machining a blind hole (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 11</cross-reference>). When the large power laser beam is irradiated, the output (power) is detected by the laser beam detection sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) and the value of the output power thus detected is added by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with time, a value <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> resulting from the addition is stored as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> (Step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When laser machining by a set large power pulsed laser beam by pulse oscillation is thus terminated (Step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>), the total output value of the actual large power laser beam additionally computed by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is compared with a total output power value to be obtained by the set laser beam, that is, the command value (Step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). In case where the actual output power is found insufficient as the result of comparison, the command output of the next small power laser beam is so adjusted as to be increased with the respect to the set value, whereas in case where the actual output power is found too great, the command output is so adjusted as to be decreased (Step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>). In case where both output power values are equal, the set value is maintained without being adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Further, small power laser beam machining with the number of pulses set at Step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is carried out (Step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) and when the number of pulses reaches the set number, the operation of machining a perforation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is terminated (Step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the machining operation by means of the small power laser beam is stopped when the predetermined remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base is attained in the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the presence or absence of a hole to be machined is decided (Step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). In the absence of a hole to be machined next, the laser beam machining is stopped (Step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>). The adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> causes the stored charge to be discharged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> by utilizing time upon termination of machining so as to provide for the next addition. In the presence of a hole to be machined next, the drilling depth per pulse of the large power laser beam is calculated (Step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Then, the routine returns to Step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at which the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is detected by electrostatic capacity sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, so that the number of pulses by means of the large power pulsed laser beam is calculated to correspond to the thickness. At this time, the calculation of the number pulses is performed based on drilling depth per pulse calculated at Step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. In other words, the number of pulses of the large power pulsed laser beam is calculated so that the value obtained by multiplying the drilling depth per pulse by the number of pulses corresponds to that of the drilling depth attained by the large power pulsed laser beam, and the calculated number thereof is corrected when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Then the routine at Step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the following steps is implemented. As the routine is repeated, a plurality of blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are continuously made along the surface of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the continuous portions are intermittently formed, whereby a tearable portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a desired form can be provided in the surface of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the second embodiment of the invention, the following effect is achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The correction of the output power of the laser beam is made at the time of small power laser irradiation following the large power laser irradiation. Even though an error in the drilling depth of the hole is made because of the large power pulsed laser beam, the error can be rectified at the time of machining by means of the small power laser beam. Consequently, it is possible to accurately secure the predetermined remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base, whereby to form the tearable portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is surely opened under the predetermined conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Since the drilling operation is carried out by means of the large power laser beam prior to the drilling operation by means of the small power laser beam, the opening side of the blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is widely formed. Consequently, inactive gas and swarfs of the workpiece are smoothly discharged from the blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the time of irradiation of the laser beam, whereby the drilling operation can be performed precisely and efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As the pulse-to-pulse output power of the laser beam by the pulse oscillation is added by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the total power value of the laser beam output by the pulse oscillation can accurately be calculated to accurately secure the drilling depth, that is, the desired remain thickness of the panel base, which is different from the case of using integration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> By detecting the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to adjust the output power of the laser beam in response to variation in the thickness thereof, the depth of blind holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made adjustable in response to the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base is kept constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When the laser beam is adjusted in response to the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the number of pulses of the laser beam given considerable deep in determining the drilling depth is made an object for adjustment by adjusting the output power of the large power laser beam. Therefore, the drilling depth by means of laser beam machining can effectively be corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When the laser beam output power by the pulse oscillation is adjusted in response to the result of addition made by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the drilling depth can finely be adjusted by adjusting the number of small power laser beams, whereby the accurate remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base is secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The laser beam output power by the pulse oscillation for the following holes is corrected in response to the result of addition made by the adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, whereby the constant remain thickness L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the panel base is secured. Thus, the uniform remain thickness of the panel base can be provided as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> &lt;Modified Examples of the Second Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The following modification can be made to the second embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the invention, the laser beam output power for the following drilling operation is corrected by detecting the output power of the large power laser beam. On the other hand, instead of this, the output power of the large power laser beam and the output of the small power laser beam both may be detected and reflected on the following drilling operation, whereby more accurate drilling operation can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the invention, the laser output power of the following large power laser beam is corrected by detecting the output power of the large power laser beam. On the other hand, instead of this, the output power of the small power laser beam may be corrected, whereby the drilling depth can finely be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the invention, the result detected by the electrostatic capacity sensor is reflected on the output power of the large power pulsed laser beam. On the other hand, the result detected by the electrostatic capacity sensor may be reflected on the small power pulsed laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the invention, the irradiation power of the small power laser beam is reduced to 50% of that of the large power laser beam. On the other hand, the irradiation power of the small power laser beam may be set at any value between 70% or lower and 20% or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As a detection unit for detecting the thickness of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there may be used any sensor other than the electrostatic capacity sensor; for example, a sensor for mechanically detecting the thickness of a workpiece by contacting the surface of the workpiece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, whereby cost for such a detection unit is reducible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The invention is applied to a case where laser machining is applied any other component than an automotive instrument panel; for example, the center cover of a steering wheel. Even in this case, the same operation/working effect as what has been described in the second embodiment of the invention is achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> While only certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will apparent that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
