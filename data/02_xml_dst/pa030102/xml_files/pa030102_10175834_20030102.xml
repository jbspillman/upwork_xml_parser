<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an alignment method, an exposure apparatus and a device fabrication method used in device fabrication accompanying various micromachining fabrication processes for manufacturing semiconductor devices such as an IC and an LSI, display devices such as a liquid crystal display panel, detection devices such as a magnetic head and image sensing devices such as a CCD. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, a photolithography process for manufacturing semiconductor devices and the like employs an exposure apparatus which transfers a pattern of original plate (mask or reticle) onto a photoresist-coated substrate. Recently, a projection reduction exposure apparatus advantageous for its high resolution and alignment accuracy is used as the exposure apparatus. Generally, a semiconductor device is fabricated by forming multiple layers of circuit patterns by using different original plates, on plural shot areas arrayed on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The shot array of plural shot areas on the substrate is called a shot layout. The shot layout is made in consideration of the size of the substrate, the size of shot area, the size of chip area and the like. Further, a necessary number of shots, selected based on the shot layout, for overlaying circuits for formation of the multilayer circuit, are called sample shots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Upon selection of sample shots, an arbitrary number of shots is designated, then determination of selectability of shots as sample shots is performed on all the shots of the shot layout, in accordance with a predetermined selectability determination condition, and a candidate shot group is determined. The selectability determination is made in consideration of the position of alignment mark within shot, a distance from a substrate edge of alignment mark in each shot, a limitation due to relative positional relation with respect to hardware mechanisms such as an alignment mark monitoring optical system and a focus measuring system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Next, the shots of the candidate shot group are ranked in priority order by a priority determination algorithm. In the ranking, shots in the outmost peripheral positions are often ranked to lower ordinal levels. The outmost peripheral shots are positioned on the border between an exposure area and a non-exposure area, and in comparison with inner shots, there is apprehension that the condition of alignment mark shape or the like becomes unstable due to influence of fabrication process. When the ranking has been completed, selection is made from high priority shots, thereby a final sample shots are selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as the shot size is smaller in comparison with the substrate size, the number of shots within the substrate is large, and the number of selectable high-priority shots as the sample shots is large. However, with recent increase in semiconductor device size or increase in 1-shot exposure area (angle of view), the number of shots within the substrate tends to decrease. The reduction of shots causes reduction of shots as selection candidates upon sample shot selection, and by extension, disturbs improvement of alignment accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The substrate size is also increased, and in such case, the fabrication device in a fabrication plant must be changed. To enlarge a device or the angle of view of the exposure apparatus while utilizing the conventional facilities, the reduction of alignment selection candidate shots accompanying the reduction of shots within the substrate is unavoidable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, regarding the alignment mark arrangement in the shot, conventionally, measurement marks are arranged in X and Y measurement directions, i.e., an X directional mark is arranged in a horizontal scribe line, and a Y directional mark is arranged in a vertical scribe line, thereby a measurement error is suppressed to a minimum value. However, in recent years, to improve productivity, various mark arrangements are introduced. For example, a measurement mark capable of simultaneous XY directional measurement which reduces measurement time and an in-shot multiple point measurement mark for the purpose of correction of shot shape are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, a necessary number of samples cannot be obtained by the conventional sample shot selection since the number of shots is reduced although various alignment mark arrangements have been studied. Even if the necessary number of samples can be obtained, the arrangement of shots on the substrate is not desirable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and has its object to provide an alignment method, an exposure apparatus and a device fabrication method which perform alignment mark selection for alignment measurement in correspondence with reduction of number of shots due to increase in angle of view, increase in variety of alignment correction methods and the like, and thereby improve alignment accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the foregoing object is attained by providing an alignment method comprising; a selection step of performing alignment mark selection, in alignment mark units, based on a shot layout and a predetermined logic, from alignment marks accompanying respective shots; a measurement step of measuring positions of alignment marks selected at said selection step among the alignment marks of the respective shots formed on a substrate based on said shot layout; and an alignment step of performing alignment for overlay exposure for the respective shots formed on said substrate, based on the result of measurement at said measurement step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, the foregoing object is attained by providing an exposure control data generation method comprising; a setting step of setting a selectable area for alignment mark selection based on an outer shape of a substrate and a shot layout; a selection step of selecting alignment marks appropriate to alignment from said selectable area; and a generation step of generating exposure control data for necessary alignment operation by using the alignment mark selected at said selection step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the present invention, the foregoing object is attained by providing an exposure control data generation apparatus, comprising; setting means for setting a selectable area for alignment mark selection based on an outer shape of a substrate and a shot layout; selection means for selecting alignment marks appropriate to alignment from said selectable area; and generation means for generating exposure control data for necessary alignment operation by using the alignment mark selected by said selection means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, upon selection of alignment mark for alignment measurement based on a shot layout, different from the conventional alignment mark selection as sample shots in shot units, selection is made by determining applicability of each alignment mark. Accordingly, different from the conventional selection that all the outmost peripheral alignment marks are eliminated, even an alignment mark of an outmost peripheral shot, if it satisfies a predetermined logic, it can be selected as an alignment mark for alignment measurement. Further, in a case where plural types of alignment marks are provided for one shot, different from the conventional determination in shot units, different selection logics can be applied to the respective types. Accordingly, the selection can be easily made in correspondence with the increase in the variety of alignment correction methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> That is, according to the present invention, upon selectability determination, a selection condition is applied to each alignment mark on the substrate, in consideration of the type, the purpose and the like of each alignment, from position information of each alignment mark on the substrate. Thereafter, a necessary number of alignment marks for alignment measurement can be selected, based on a selection algorithm, from selectable alignment marks. At this time, the selection is performed on each alignment mark, which reduces the ill effect on alignment measurement and the result of measurement due to increase in the number of unselectable marks, which is caused by reduction of outmost peripheral shots accompanying increase in shot angle of view. Further, upon selection of necessary number of alignment marks, the freedom can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same name or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exposure apparatus having an alignment apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, alphabet R denotes a reticle; W, a wafer, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a projection lens which projects a pattern of the reticle R onto the wafer W; and S, an alignment optical system for the wafer W.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this construction, illumination light from the alignment illumination device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is emitted on the alignment mark on the wafer W via the beam splitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the projection lens <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, symbol EG denotes an edge of substrate; SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, shots in outmost peripheral positions in a shot layout; SAm<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SAm<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denote alignment marks belonging to the shots SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are not selected by the conventional technique; SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, shots in 1-shot inner positions from the outmost peripheral positions; SBm<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SBm<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, alignment marks belonging to the shot SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are selected as marks used in measurement by the conventional technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of selection of alignment marks from the XY directional independent measurement marks according to the present embodiment. In the figure, symbol ET denotes a latitude in alignment mark selectability determination based on a previously-designated distance (hereinbelow ET value) from the substrate edge EG; ST, a latitude in alignment mark selectability determination based on a previously-designated distance (hereinbelow ST value) from a border between an exposure area and a non-exposure area. Alignment marks within an area determined by the latitudes ET and ST are selectable. Accordingly, alignment marks SAm<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to SAm<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are selectable alignment marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Generally, in an area which is a predetermined-distance away from the substrate edge EG, a device pattern and non-device pattern such as alignment mark are not formed in an excellent state due to deformation of the substrate itself and influence of fabrication process. Further, in some cases, pattern formation is not performed for convenience of other process apparatuses than the exposure apparatus and substrate transfer. Accordingly, a latitude value (ET value) determining the latitude ET is determined at the fabrication process and it is often unchangeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as the pattern status within exposure area is excellent in many cases, a value to determine the latitude of distance from the border between the exposure area and non-exposure area (ST value) may be set to a smaller value in comparison with the latitude value from the substrate edge EG depending on the process condition. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the result of alignment mark selectability determination in the case where the latitude value to determine the latitude ST is set to a small value. In this manner, the alignment marks SAm<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and SAm<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be selectable by reducing the latitude value (reducing the distance from the border). Further, the determination of ST value may be made in consideration of the position of alignment mark within shot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the result of alignment mark selectability determination in use of the XY directional independent measurement marks on the entire substrate by the conventional art. In the figure, alignment marks belonging to shots D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to D<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are selectable. Since the alignment marks are selected in shot units and alignment marks belonging to outmost peripheral shots are not selected, the number of selectable alignment marks is reduced and the selectable marks are concentrated around the center of the substrate as the shot angle of view increases with respect to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the result of alignment mark selectability determination according to the present embodiment, in use of the XY directional independent measurement marks, on each alignment mark M, based on position information of each alignment mark, the distance from the substrate edge and the latitude value of distance from the substrate edge, and the distance from the border between exposure area and non-exposure area and the latitude value of the distance therefrom. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an AND area within the latitudes ET and ST is a selectable area, and alignment marks within the selectable area are selected. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, alignment marks selectable in entire X and Y directional areas exist around the X axis and Y axis. Thus, alignment mark selection for various alignment operations can be made, and alignment accuracy can be improved. X and Y directional alignment marks of shots A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Y directional measurement alignment marks of shots B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and X directional measurement alignment marks of shots C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are unselectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Note that in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the same determination condition is applied to the X directional measurement mark and the X directional measurement mark, however, it may be arranged such that independent latitudes are set for the respective marks in accordance with purpose, process condition, alignment correction method and the like of each mark. For example, if X and Y directional measurement marks are independent as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the condition for specifying a selectable area for the X directional measurement mark may be different from that for the Y directional measurement mark. Further, if three types of measurement marks exist as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, three types of selectable area may be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The alignment mark selection processing as described above is performed by a recipe generation function provided in e.g. the control device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the exposure apparatus, and alignment marks selected by the processing are applied to actual exposure processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a construction of the recipe generation function the control device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the exposure apparatus according to the embodiment. The recipe generation function <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>performs the alignment mark selection as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and generates a recipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(a data set indicating the way to process a wafer). An exposure processing program refers to the recipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, performs wafer alignment by alignment processing, then performs the well-known exposure processing to print a reticle pattern on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, an alignment selection parameter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and exposure job information <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the alignment selection parameter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the above-described ST value and ET value are registered for each exposure job type. The exposure job information <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is one or plural types of exposure jobs including information on wafer type, shot area, exposure condition and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing processing by the recipe generation function <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. First, at step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the ST value and the ET value corresponding to an exposure job to be performed are obtained from the alignment selection parameter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Note that in the embodiment, the ST value and ET value are selected based on the exposure job, however, the invention is not limited to this arrangement. For example, the ST value may be selected in correspondence with the type of alignment mark, the position of alignment mark within shot or the like. Further, the ET value may be selected based on a wafer to be used. At step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an exposure area (shot layout) is obtained from the exposure information <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>corresponding to the exposure job to be performed, and the border between exposure area and non-exposure area is specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the latitude ST and the latitude ET as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are determined based on the type of wafer to be used in the exposure job (shape and size), the border specified at step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the ET value and the ST value obtained at step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Then, an area where the latitudes ST and ET overlap with each other (AND area) is set as an alignment mark selectable range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, several alignment marks applicable to alignment processing are selected from the alignment mark selectable range set at step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Then at step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a recipe (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) appropriate to the exposure is generated based on the alignment marks selected at step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the exposure job information, and stored into the storage device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The exposure processing program <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>performs the exposure processing in accordance with the recipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>generated as described above. That is, the program performs wafer alignment by using the alignment marks selected at step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and performs the exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Note that in the present embodiment, the latitude ET is appropriately set to an area about 3 mm away from the wafer outer periphery (ET value&equals;3 mm), and the latitude ST, to an area about 1 to 2 mm away from the exposure area (ST value&equals;1 to 2 mm). Respective optimum values are determined in correspondence with the type of wafer, the type of shot or the characteristic of the exposure apparatus. Further, as an example of the alignment mark selection at step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, selection is made such that alignment marks are rotationally symmetrical with respect to the wafer center as much as possible. Otherwise, the selection method disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,320. Note that in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,320, a alignment mark selection reference in shot units is described. Apparently the reference can be applied to the reference of selection in alignment mark units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, in the embodiment, the exposure apparatus has the recipe generation function, however, it may be arranged such that the recipe generation function is realized by an external computer, and a generated recipe is downloaded to the exposure apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Device Fabrication Method&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be made about an embodiment of device fabrication method utilizing the above-described projection exposure apparatus or alignment method. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a microdevice (semiconductor chip such as an IC or LSI, a liquid crystal panel, a CCD, a thin-film magnetic head, a micromachine or the like) fabrication flow. At step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (circuit designing), a device pattern is designed. At step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a mask where the designed pattern is formed is fabricated. On the other hand, at step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (wafer fabrication), a wafer is fabricated by using material such as silicon or glass. At step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (wafer process), called a preprocess, an actual circuit is formed on the wafer by a lithography technique using the above mask and wafer. At the next step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (assembly), called a postprocess, a semiconductor chip is fabricated by using the wafer carrying the circuit formed at step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes an assembly process (dicing and bonding), a packaging process (chip encapsulation) and the like. At step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (inspection), inspections such as operation check, durability test and the like are performed on the semiconductor device formed at step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor device is completed through these processes, and is shipped (step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the detailed flow of the waver process (step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). At step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (oxidation), the surface of the wafer is oxidized. At step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (CVD), an insulating film is formed on the surface of the wafer. At step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (electrode formation), electrodes are formed by vapor deposition on the wafer. At step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (ion implantation), ions are injected in the wafer. At step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (resist processing), the wafer is coated with photoresist. At step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (exposure), the mask circuit pattern is exposure-printed on the wafer by the above-described exposure apparatus or method. At step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (development), the exposed wafer is developed. At step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (etching), other portions than the developed resist are removed. At step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (resist stripping), the resist which is unnecessary after the completion of etching is removed. These steps are repeated, to form a multiple layers of circuit patterns on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, at each process, upon exposure (step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), high oeverlay accuracy is obtained, and the efficiency of semiconductor device fabrication can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, as alignment marks for alignment measurement are selected in alignment mark units, selectability is determined by each alignment mark or each type of alignment mark. Further, a necessary number of alignment marks can be selected in correspondence with enlarged angle of exposure view or various alignment methods. Accordingly, the alignment accuracy can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
