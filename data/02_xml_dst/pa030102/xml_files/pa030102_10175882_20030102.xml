<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a side view of the saddle riding type vehicle of the related art, wherein the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mainly comprises a vehicle body frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> mounted at the center of the vehicle body frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a saddle seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> provided above the engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a fuel tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> disposed forwardly of the saddle seat <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and front wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the far side is not shown) rotatably mounted on the sides of the front portion of the vehicle body frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via suspension mechanisms <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on the far side is not shown). Further included are a steering <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for steering the front wheels <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, rear wheels <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on the far side is not shown) rotatably mounted on both sides of the rear portion of the vehicle body frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via suspension mechanisms <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the far side is not shown), a front propeller shaft <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for transmitting rotation of the engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a final speed reducer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> on the side of the front wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a rear propeller shaft <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for transmitting rotation of the engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> on the side of the rear wheels <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The saddle riding type wheel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also comprises a propeller shaft <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> connected between the engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> on the side of the rear wheel <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> with a falling gradient and an engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> disposed at the high position of the vehicle. Therefore, it is desirable to lower the center of gravity of the vehicle by disposing the engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the lower position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, since the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is disposed at the lower position, the height of the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> from the ground decreases. As a consequence, it is difficult to ensure sufficient suspension stroke of the rear wheel <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The term &ldquo;suspension stroke&rdquo; means the distance of movement of the wheel from a state in which the wheel is pushed up and the suspension is compressed to the maximum extent to a state in which the suspension is expanded to the maximum extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a plan view of the saddle riding type vehicle of the related art, and it is referable that the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a rear propeller shaft <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> being disposed from the engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> toward the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> in almost parallel with the centerline of the vehicle body C and the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is disposed at the position closer to the left rear wheel <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When the rear final speed reducer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is disposed closer to the left rear wheel <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the left drive shaft <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>L is shorter than the right drive shaft <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>R, and thus it is difficult to ensure a sufficient amount of movement of the wheel in the vertical direction. As a consequence, the suspension stroke of the rear wheels <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the inventor sought further enlightenments and proposed Patent Application No.373986/2000 entitled &ldquo;A SADDLE RIDING TYPE VEHICLE&rdquo; as an improved technology relating to saddle riding type vehicles of the related art. The principal portions of this technology will be described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a side view showing the layout of the propeller shaft of the saddle riding type vehicle proposed in the proceeding application, in which the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a propeller shaft <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> connected to the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> side via a coupling <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> at one end and to the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> via a coupling <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> at the other end, and disposed in substantially parallel with the ground. As a consequence, the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> could be disposed at the lower position, and thus the center of gravity could be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By arranging the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in substantially parallel with the ground, the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can be moved upward, and thus the suspension stroke could be improved. In the figure, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> designates a vehicle body frame, the numeral <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> designates a saddle seat, the numeral <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> designates a suspension mechanism, and the numeral <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> designates a rear wheel. </paragraph>

As a consequence, since the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> had to be disposed diagonally, one each of the coupling for the side of the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and for the side of the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, that is, two couplings <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> in total were necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> described above, the center of gravity was lowered and the suspension stroke was improved by disposing the propeller shaft in substantially parallel with the ground in side view and thus arranging the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at the lower position. However, it is desired to give further room for the suspension stroke to prevent limiting of the design or the layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> described above, the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is disposed by providing the couplings <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> on the side of the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and on the side of the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> respectively.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention is to provide a technology in which a sufficient suspension stroke can be obtained and the power transmitting mechanism can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the object described above, according to the present invention, a saddle riding type vehicle comprises an engine mounted at the center of the vehicle body frame, a saddle seat provided above the engine, and rear wheels mounted on both sides of the rear portion of the vehicle body frame, and a propeller shaft being provided with a rising gradient from the engine to a final speed reducer, wherein power of the engine is transmitted to the rear wheels via the propeller shaft and the final speed reducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> By providing the propeller shaft a rising gradient from the engine toward the final speed reducer, the final speed reducer is provided at the upper position, that is, the final speed reducer is disposed at the high position from the ground, so that the sufficient suspension stroke is obtained. As a consequence, the design freedom or layout freedom is expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By providing the propeller shaft with a rising gradient from the engine toward the final speed reducer, the heavy engine is disposed at the lower position of the vehicle body frame, so that the center of gravity can further be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the final speed reducer is directly connected to the propeller shaft by bringing the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer for transmitting driving force from the propeller shaft in line with the axis of the propeller shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For example, when the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer is not brought in line with the axis of the propeller shaft, it is necessary to connect the propeller shaft to the final speed reducer via a coupling or the like. Therefore, the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer is brought in line with the axis of the propeller shaft to connect the final speed reducer directly to the propeller shaft. As a consequence, for example, the coupling can be eliminated, and thus the construction may be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</paragraph>

Thhe saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is a vehicle in which, by bringing the transmission shaft <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the side of the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for transmitting driving force from the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in line with the axis C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be directly connected to the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For example, when the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer is not brought in line with the axis of the propeller shaft, it is necessary to connect the propeller shaft to the final speed reducer via a coupling or the like. Therefore, the transmission shaft <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the side of the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is brought in line with the axis C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thereby directly connecting the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> directly to the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, for example, the coupling can be eliminated, and thus the construction may be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The operation of the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above will be describe below. FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are explanatory drawings illustrating the operation of the saddle riding type vehicle according to the present invention, in which <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a comparative example, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a vehicle in which a propeller shaft <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is connected to the side of the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> via a coupling <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> at one end, and to the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> via a coupling <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> at the other end, and disposed in substantially parallel with the ground. As a consequence, the engine <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> could be disposed at the lower position, and thus the center of gravity could be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By arranging the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in substantially parallel with the ground, the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can be moved upward, and thus the suspension stroke could be improved. However, it is desired to give further room for the suspension stroke, in order to prevent limitations in the design or in the layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By comparison, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in the saddle riding type vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, by providing the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> a rising gradient from the engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided at the upper position, that is, the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at the high position from the ground, so that the sufficient suspension stroke is obtained. As a consequence, the design freedom or layout freedom is expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> By providing the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> a rising gradient from the engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the heavy engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed at the lower position of the vehicle body frame <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), so that the center of gravity can further be lowered. In addition, since the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is directly connected to the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the coupling or the like on the side of the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be eliminated, and thus the construction may be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a plan view of another embodiment of the joint to be connected to one end of the propeller shaft in the saddle riding type vehicle according to the present invention. This second embodiment includes an output shaft <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a transmission shaft <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a coupling <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of constant velocity type, called a constant velocity ball joint, a propeller shaft <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and a propeller shaft <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> having an axis C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It can be seen that the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is connected to the output shaft <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> via the constant velocity ball joint <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In other words, by employing the constant velocity ball joint <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, for example, when the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is used at a large angle with respect to the output shaft <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, rotation of the engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can be transmitted to the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, though the gear type in which the left and right drive shafts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are rotated at the equal velocity is employed in the final speed reducer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the embodiments described above, it is not limited thereto and an differential gear may be employed in the final speed reducer, and any type of the coupling may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With the construction described thus far, the present invention provides following advantages. Specifically, since the propeller shaft is provided with a rising gradient from the engine to the final speed reducer, the final speed reducer may be disposed at the upper position, that is, the final speed reducer is disposed at the high position from the ground, so that the sufficient suspension stroke is obtained. As a consequence, the design freedom or layout freedom may be expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By providing the propeller shaft a rising gradient from the engine toward the final speed reducer, the heavy engine is disposed at the lower position of the vehicle body frame, so that the center of gravity can further be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In addition, by bringing the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer for transmitting driving force from the propeller in line with the axis of the propeller shaft, the final speed reducer is directly connected to the propeller shaft. For example, when the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer is not brought in line with the axis of the propeller shaft, it is necessary to connect the propeller shaft to the final speed reducer via a coupling or the like. Therefore, the transmission shaft on the side of the final speed reducer is brought in line with the axis of the propeller shaft to connect the final speed reducer directly to the propeller shaft. As a consequence, for example, the coupling can be eliminated, and thus the construction may be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
