<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns a rotor with drivers as part of a separating arrangement of an agricultural machine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cutting arrangements in the take-up region of crop recovery machines are equipped with rotors with attached fingers, that grasp crop and draw it over stationary knives through which it is reduced. Since high forces are applied to the fingers or other drivers particularly upon the entry of foreign objects, a multitude of solutions are proposed in the state of the art according to which the fingers are fastened to the rotor and can be exchanged if they are damaged&mdash;see, for example, DE A 195 41 561, DE U 93 16 378, DE A 43 23 214, WO A 84/02252. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The problem underlying the invention is seen in the fact that in each case in which the envelope of a circular cylindrical tube openings is introduced, the drivers are equipped with noses and suspended in the openings and subsequently are welded or bolted together. All these manufacturing operations are costly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided an improved crop-feeding rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide a crop-feeding rotor including a center drive member having a non-circular profile on which is received complementary shaped openings of fingers or other drivers. In this way, the openings and the noses prevalent in the prior art rotors and drivers can be omitted; rather permanent locking is performed on the basis of the non-circular profile of the tube, in particular a profile with edges, where in place of a tube a solid body could be used and is specifically included in the scope of this invention. In this way the tube can be equipped with three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more edges. A tube with, for example, a cross-shaped profile or the like could also be selected, the important point being that the outer profile is non-circular. The drivers can be configured individually and combined into a ring or manufactured as a ring that is then slid axially onto the tube. Here it is sufficient that the drivers or the ring have only point contact with the circumference of the tube as long as a retention is attained, that is not subject to rotation. While in the simplest case the drivers are configured as fingers, teeth or the like, they can also be used as fixed knives, such as, for example, that of a straw chopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Large cost reductions are attained if the number of drivers around the tube per row are combined into a one-piece ring, for example, stamped from a steel plate, machined or flame cut. Particularly with stamping, high strength and short manufacturing time can be attained. With cutting or flame cutting, particularly using laser technology very close tolerances can be attained, that can result in retention of the rings on the tube practically without any play. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While the drivers can be provided with attached driver elements configured as tines, teeth or the like, a simple manufacture is nevertheless possible if the ring or the components of an assembled ring are configured as a multiple-sided polygon whose corners or points form each of the particular driver elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If the contact surfaces of drivers following each other are offset to different degrees relative to the driver elements, then the points, that is, the driver elements of the applied drivers, follow a helical shape so that load spikes are avoided. All drivers applied to a tube are brought together as a set and marked, if necessary, so that the drivers applied to the tube extend, for example, in a helical pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An alternative configuration to the offset contact surfaces lies in the arrangement in which the contact surfaces of the drivers and of the tube are in an even-numbered relationship to each other. In this way a large number of identical drivers can be manufactured but applied to the tube in differing positions. Thereby not only a helical pattern is possible, but any number of other possible distributions can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> While the drivers could be provided with shoulders or the like, in order to provide a space for strippers located opposite the rotor to slide through; a simpler approach would be to provide loose spacers that are inserted between the drivers and secured by them or retained by the tube. For example, the sides of the drivers facing each other could contain openings into which pins with heads are inserted. Or shells or the like could be welded or applied to the tube with adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Spacers with a rounded outer contour have the advantage that the crop being conveyed can slide along or over these components. The configuration as a ring makes it possible to slide them onto the tube, if necessary together with the drivers arranged as rings and to bring them into contact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A further possibility in the distribution of the drivers along the length or around the circumference consists in a variation of the number of spacers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The drivers and, if necessary, the spacers can be fastened to the tube in a simple manner by providing a retaining plate in at least one end region of the rotor that is clamped by means of screws or the like. Two retaining plates could also be used, that is, at each end region, that are clamped by means of tensioning bolts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Manufacturing costs can be reduced in an exemplary manner by providing in one or both end plates bearing journals configured as stub shafts for the support of the rotor in bearings in a frame or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to stub shafts, a shaft could be selected that extends through the tube and the retaining plates and fastens the entire assembly together, for example, by means of tensioning nuts or a tensioning nut and a shoulder.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An agricultural machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is configured as a large round baler, which is, however, intended only as an example. Rather, instead other types of agricultural machines could be included, such as a self-loading forage box, another type of baler, cutting arrangements of a combine, for example, a straw chopper or machines of this type, in which crop is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown, known for its type, contains a binding arrangement <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a draft tongue or towbar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a baling chamber <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a crop inlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a pivoted housing part <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a fixed housing part <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a pick-up <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a reducing or separating arrangement <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, all of which are known in themselves and do not require any more detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The separating arrangement <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided with a rotor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, knives <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and strippers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as are also known in themselves. Since the invention concerns the rotor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, reference here is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, parts of the rotor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be recognized, particularly a tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a retaining plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and a shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is configured with a square outer cross section with rounded corners. This is not mandatory; rather the outer cross section could have three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or more corners or be oval or cross-shaped. The rounded corners are useful for an assembly without jamming. The tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the separating arrangement <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, when used in a large round baler, is approximately as long as the width of the baling chamber <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is made from a relatively heavy-walled steel and is drawn or welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are each configured generally as a three-cornered uniform polygon that is stamped, machined or otherwise punched out of a plate as a ring. The driver elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> resulting from the corners of the polygon are relatively pointed, with pointed angles, so that the feet of the legs involved are not blended directly with each other. Rather, an arc-shaped region extends between them. The center of the driver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided with a square recess <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is provided with four contact surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which are configured with a minimum of play to the outer circumferential surfaces of the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. There should, however, be enough play that the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be slid onto the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without excessive effort. The illustration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the recess <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the driver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with reference to a spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, since these are congruent in shape and size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is also configured as a ring whose outer circumferential surface is cylindrical and whose center is also provided with a recess <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and contact surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the same size and shape as those of the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the diameter of the spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is selected in such a way that a clearance still exists to the radially innermost circumferential surface of the drivers. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are somewhat thicker than the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be made of metal (steel, aluminum) but also of plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a multitude of spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are distributed over the length of the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, three spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are located between each of two groups of drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, while between the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of a group one spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> each is located. Furthermore, at each end there is an additional spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of differing widths could also be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are configured as circular cylinders and are provided with shoulders or grooves, not visible, by means of which they are centered on the ends of the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are provided with contact surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that press against the outer driver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or the outer spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the assembled condition. Each of the retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided with a central hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, through which the shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends. The outer diameter of the retaining plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> generally corresponds to that of a spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is longer than the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and extends beyond the tube on both sides. On the right side, as seen in the figures, the shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided with a multi-tooth profile <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that engages a drive pulley or drive shaft and with a shoulder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The shoulder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is dimensioned in such a way that it can be brought into contact with the outer side of the right retaining plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. On the left side, as seen in the drawing, the shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> ends in a bearing seat <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that is followed on the inward side by a receptacle, not shown, for the tensioning nut <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with which the left retaining plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is pressed against the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or the last spacer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or the last driver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, not shown, two stub shafts are provided in place of the shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and are fastened to the retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, with the retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> being drawn together by tensioning bolts or the like. Beyond that, further configurations are conceivable. For example, the retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> could be bolted to the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It could also be possible to weld one or both retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the above description, the rotor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is completed in such a way that drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and spacers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are slid onto the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a certain sequence, that the retaining plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are brought into contact with the end faces of the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is slid through the hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and is secured by the tensioning nut <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> or by the contact of the shoulder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the right retaining plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Depending on the position of the recess <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> relative to the corner regions of the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the result is a straight-line, an offset or helical pattern of the driver elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the drivers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, not shown, the deviation from circularity of the tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attained by axial ribs, moldings or the like that are applied to a round tube by bolting, welding or riveting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
