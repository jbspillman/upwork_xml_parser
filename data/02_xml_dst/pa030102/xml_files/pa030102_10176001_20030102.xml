<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a network image processing apparatus, a monitoring apparatus and a method for monitoring the network image processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, personal computers (hereinafter referred to as PCs) are used to remotely monitor an image processing apparatus, such as printer, facsimile apparatus, copy machine, multifunction printer, etc. One of the protocols that are used for such remote monitoring is SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> SNMP is a protocol to monitor and manage apparatuses that are connected to TCP/IP network, via network. SNMP is developed as a standard protocol for transmitting network managing information, such as HUB, which is a managing system (agent), to a managing system (manager). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When monitoring status of a network OA apparatus (e.g., no paper for printer) by a PC of the monitoring side, SNMP is extended to utilize since the SNMP specification does not define such status monitoring as a standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For remote monitoring of image processing apparatuses using conventional SNMP, the managing system inquires for status information in predetermined intervals, while the managed system replies by transmitting the current status information in accordance with the inquiry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In such cases, as seen in a network printer system, in a network environment where multiple managing systems exist per only one managed system, inquiries from multiple managing systems are directed toward the managed system. Thus, inquiry conflicts become frequent and the processing demands on the managing system increase. As a result, the managing system often fails to receive replies to the inquiries and it becomes difficult to effectively perform remote monitoring on the monitored system from the monitoring system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is provided in view of above-described problems. The object of the invention is to provide a network image processing apparatus and monitoring apparatus with which a monitoring apparatus can remotely monitor a network image processing apparatus effectively and securely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To solve the problems, a unit is provided, which determines an optimum connection interval for inquiries from a monitoring apparatus, notifies the monitoring apparatus of the optimum value, and requests the monitoring apparatus to update interval setting that is kept by the monitoring apparatus, according to the connection conditions of the monitoring apparatus with the network image processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the monitoring apparatus connects with the interval that is proposed by the network image processing apparatus. Since this interval is an optimum interval according to the connection status of the monitoring apparatus, inquiry conflicts from the monitoring apparatus to the network image processing apparatus are eliminated, and the processing demands on the network image processing apparatus decrease. As a result, it is possible to prevent the situation when the monitoring apparatus is frequently incapable of receiving replies, and to remotely monitor the network image processing apparatus from the monitoring apparatus effectively and securely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this specification, connection status of a monitoring apparatus specifically includes a number of inquiries (commands) per a unit of time, and a number of connections made by a monitoring apparatus to a network image processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, in this specification, network apparatuses include all of the apparatuses that are connected to a TCP/IP network and perform data transmission/reception via the network. Network image processing apparatuses include network apparatuses that comprise at least one of image recorder and image scanner, and specifically include network printers, network multifunction printers, network scanners, network facsimiles, network connecting personal computers, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Additionally, apparatuses that are managed by the SNMP including network apparatuses, are inclusively referred to as managed systems (agents). PCs that manage the managed system are altogether referred to as managing systems (managers).</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a managing system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, specifically in the program storage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn, a program that operates as a SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is stored, so that the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can execute the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In a managed system <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, in particular, in the program storage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a program that operates as a SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is stored, so that CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can execute the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> perform communication using the SNMP protocol via the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In detail, a command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> transmits a command message &lt;GetRequest-PDU&gt; to the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and attempts to obtain information (MIB). To designate an MIB, an object ID is used. A command receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> receives &lt;GetRequest-PDU&gt;, and a command analyzer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> analyzes the command message. A designated MIB transmitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> reads the information (MIB) designated by the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from an agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and transmits the MIB to the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by using the response message &lt;GetResponse-PDU&gt;. In the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an MIB receiver <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the reply message and updates the corresponding object of the manager side MIB <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, based on the transmitted information. In this embodiment, PDU stands for a &ldquo;protocol data unit&rdquo; and represents a block that configures a message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the remote monitoring system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment of the invention, in order to monitor the status of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the SNMP, both the manager side MIB <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> set &lt;status MIB&gt; that is a private MIB indicating status information of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a MIB update unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The MIB update unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> obtains status information of individual units of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and updates the corresponding status MIB. Status information includes out of paper, paper jam, low toner, open door, amount of communication, output number of pages, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn, an MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> orders the command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to transmit command message requesting the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for an MIB (hereinafter referred to as obtaining command). The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> orders transmission of the obtaining command, when a predetermined MIB obtaining condition establishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> attempts to obtain predetermined multiple MIBs, when an MIB obtaining condition establishes. In detail, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> delivers object IDs that individually designate multiple MIBs to be obtained (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;obtaining ID&rdquo; separately, and &ldquo;obtaining IDs&rdquo; altogether), to the command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> generates a obtaining command from the obtaining OIDs received from the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and transmits the command. In the embodiment, from the point of transmitting an obtaining command for the first obtaining OID of the obtaining OIDs, to the point of transmitting a obtaining command for the last obtaining OID is considered as one access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In response to the obtaining command for the status MIB, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> transmits an MIB of the agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The obtained MIB by the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the above procedure is hereinafter referred to as obtained MIB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the obtained MIB is a &lt;status MIB&gt;, MIB receiver <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> analyzes the obtained MIB, recognizes the status information, and transmits the status information to a status display unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The status display unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> displays the status information on the display <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and notifies the operators of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn of the processing contents and errors at the network apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is provided, that counts the number of received MIB obtaining commands at the command receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> counts the number of the commands that are in a predetermined measurement period, which is measured by a timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and notifies an access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the count result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> determines command reception frequency from the count result, and determines an optimum access interval time. As an example of the method, the number of requests that are received during a measurement period is divided by the number of managers that sent the requests during the measurement period, in order to calculate the number of requests per one manager. The processing time for a response for one request as an agent apparatus can be set as a constant from a calculation of an apparatus component (processing speed, memory capacity of the CPU, etc.) and from an actual measurement. By multiplying the above number of request per one manager with the above constant, the minimum interval for the next request transmission for one manager can be determined. When actually giving an MIB to the manager, the value is given by multiplying the value for each manager that is obtaining the MIB. In other words, after an interval is set, the calculated value is given to the manager that is obtaining the value (MIB) first, and the doubled calculated value is given to the second manager that is obtaining the MIB next. This procedure continues until the next measurement is completed. Accordingly, the request transmission timing of each manager is delayed, and requests are orderly made from each manger by time-sharing. Therefore, the agent process works more efficiently. As a different method, several time intervals can be preset. For example, by having time intervals with multiple levels, manager can normally receive the shortest time. During the time span from the point when the number of requests has exceeded the processing capacity of the agent, until when the number of requests resumes within the processing capacity, each time of different levels can be given to each manger in the order of accessing to obtain the interval time, so as to delay the timing. The access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> delivers the optimum access interval time to the MIB update unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Based on the received access interval time, MIB update unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> updates &lt;access interval MIB&gt; that is defined in the agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes obtaining OIDs that designate &lt;access interval MIB&gt; in the obtaining OIDs. Accordingly, the command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> transmits obtaining command that requests &lt;access interval MIB&gt;. In response to the obtaining command, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> transmits &lt;access interval MIB&gt;. In the managing system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the MIB receiver <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives &lt;access interval MIB&gt; and updates &lt;access interval MIB&gt; that is defined in the manager side MIB <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. By analyzing the &lt;access interval MIB&gt;, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> recognizes the access interval time. The timer setter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> sets the recognized access interval time as a timer setting, and set the same for the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After the processing for all of the reply is finished, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> starts the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> directs the command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for the next command transmission, when the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> measures the set access interval time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, timer setter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and status display unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the managing system side, and MIB update unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the managed system side are functions that becomes available by the programs executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, when the power is turned on and the initialization of the apparatus and network is completed, the program of managed system <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> starts up. Then, the command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> initially clears the number of command to zero, and starts the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>). Next, the command receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> waits for SNMP command reception (Step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>). If there is a SNMP command reception, the command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> counts up the number of commands by one (Step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>). Further, by referring to the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> determines whether the predetermined measurement period has passed since the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> started the counts (Step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo; at Step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> delivers the number of commands to the access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> then calculates command reception frequency from the number of commands (Step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>). Specifically, the command reception frequency is calculated, for example, as a number of commands per time unit (e.g., per minute), by dividing the counted number of command by the measurement period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Next, the access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> determines an access interval that is optimum for the calculated command reception frequency (Step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>). The determination of access interval is performed specifically in the described method above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Further, the access interval determiner <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> updates the access interval MIB that is defined by the agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the determined access interval time (Step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, the command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> clears the number of commands to zero, and restarts the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> after initializing the same (Step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo; at the Step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and after initializing the number of commands and the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> performs a process that corresponds to the obtained command received at the command receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and replies to the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> determines access interval time that is optimum for the number of command per time unit (command reception frequency) from PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn, transmits the determined access interval time to PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn, and requests PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn to actively perform command transmission accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the personal computer as an SNMP manager, according to the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn are turned on, and the initialization of the apparatus and the network is completed, the program of the managing system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is started. Then, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> determines whether the MIB obtaining condition is established (Step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>). The MIB obtaining conditions for periodically obtaining status information include monitoring remaining amount of paper and toner for a printer, for example. For frequently obtaining status information, the MIB obtaining conditions also include a situation when an immediate resolution of an obstacle is needed, for example, paper jam, and it is necessary to repeatedly monitor the printer until it resolves the problem or to wait until the printing job is finished. The above conditions include a situation for automatically obtaining the information according to the schedule that is pre-programmed by the manager, and for manually obtaining the information by a network manager (human who operates and manages the manager). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo; at Step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the process waits until the condition is established. When the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo; at Step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> directs the command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to the obtaining OIDs and orders to transmit obtaining command (Step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). According to the order, the command transmitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> transmits the obtaining command to the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> then checks whether all responses are received from the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>). If the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo;, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> checks again. Accordingly, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> monitors the MIB receiver <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and waits until all of the responses are received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving all of the responses, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> reads an MIB one by one, which is obtained from the manager side MIB <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>). The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> further determines whether the MIB that is read is &lt;access interval MIB&gt; (Step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>). If the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo;, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> analyzes &lt;access interval MIB&gt; to recognize the access interval time (Step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>). The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> further transmits the access interval time to the timer setter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The timer setter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> updates the timer setting of the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, with the received access interval time (Step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Conversely, if the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo; at Step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> determines whether the MIB that is read is &lt;status MIB&gt; (ST <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>). If the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo;, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> analyzes &lt;status MIB&gt; and recognizes the status information of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>). Then, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> transmits the status information to the status display unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, so that the status display unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> displays the received status information on the display <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo; for both Steps <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a process for the obtained MIB is performed (Step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>). This process includes changing the managing content of the manager, such as information of configuration of an apparatus that does not frequently change as an apparatus (number of cassettes, paper size of each cassette, and size of equipped memory). For example, if the cassette 1 changes the paper size from A4 to B4, managing for B4 size paper is required. Similarly, if number of cassette changes from 2 to 3-4, paper managing for cassettes 3 and 4 is required. Therefore, it is required to newly obtain such status MIB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the Steps <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> are completed, whether there are any remaining obtained MIB is checked (Step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>). If the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo;, the control returns to Step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and performs the process for the obtained MIB at Steps <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. If the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo;, the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is started (Step <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>), and the control checks whether the set access interval time has expired and it is time-out (Step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, the determination is repeated until it is time-out, and it is possible to delay the access from the managing system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the managed system <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for the access interval time. Therefore, it is possible for PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn to perform command transmission with the intervals according to the access interval time that is decided and proposed by the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate SNMP sequence between the network printer apparatus and the personal computer, according to the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> only illustrates operation of one PC of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn. However, PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn can actually transmit obtaining commands to the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> simultaneously, and the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can receive obtaining commands other than what is shown in this sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn designates multiple object IDs (OIDs) that indicate MIB to be obtained to the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>). In this embodiment, the MIB to be obtained is &lt;status MIB&gt;, and their object IDs are referred to as &ldquo;obtaining OIDs&rdquo;. The SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> transmits &lt;GetRequest-PDU&gt; one by one, which is a obtaining command message requesting for the MIB that is designated by the obtaining OIDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts the command reception frequency measurement and start the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> counts up the number of command every time an obtaining command is received from the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and transmits a reply message &lt;GetResponse-PDU&gt; that transmits the MIB designated by the obtaining command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The designated OIDs include status MIB that defines the status information of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and OID<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as designating OID, that designates access interval MIB. The SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> transmits &lt;access interval MIB&gt; in the agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, according to the obtaining command that designates OID<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving responses regarding all of the obtaining OIDs of OID<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-OIDn (hereinafter referred to as obtained MIBs), the SNMP manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> transmits the obtained MIBs to the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> then processes each MIB of the obtained MIBs. Specifically, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> analyzes &lt;status MIB&gt;, recognizes the status information of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, transmits the data to the status display unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and displays the status on the display <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The process for &lt;access interval MIB&gt; is the same as explained above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As explained in Steps <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, access to the SNMP agent <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is delayed for the amount of access interval time. When the MIB obtaining condition establishes again thereafter, or if the MIB obtaining condition has been established already, the MIB obtainer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> starts the second access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When the timer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a time-out, the frequency measurement is stopped, the command counter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> determines the command reception frequency from the counted number of commands, and determines an access interval time that is optimum for the command reception frequency. The MIB update unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> then updates &lt;access interval MIB&gt; of the agent side MIB <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> with the determined access interval time. Accordingly, at the next access, &lt;access interval MIB&gt; that is updated as a response to the OID<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is transmitted to PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn. Based on the updated &lt;access interval MIB&gt;, PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn updates the timer setting of the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Consequently, PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn are able to delay their next and subsequent accesses for an access interval time that is optimum for the command reception frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As described in the above embodiment, according to the monitoring method of network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, reception frequency of obtaining command from PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn toward the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is measured, access interval time optimum for the reception frequency is determined and notified to PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn, and timer setting of the timer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is updated according to the access interval time. Accordingly, accesses to the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn are performed with intervals that are optimum to the obtaining command frequency. Therefore, it is possible to avoid inquiry conflicts from PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn and to decrease the processing demands on the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to prevent frequent problems with PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn being incapable of receiving replies. It also makes it possible to securely and effectively monitor the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, optimum access interval time is determined based on the reception frequency of the obtaining command. However, this invention is not limited to this method, and it can be suggested that the optimum access interval time is determined based on the number of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn that are connected to the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as connecting number &ldquo;n&rdquo;). The connecting number &ldquo;n&rdquo; can be manually input to the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the network manager. Also, by setting a unit that detects the IP address of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn transmitting a packet to the network printer apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and by counting the IP address, the connecting number &ldquo;n&rdquo; can be obtained from the counted value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Whether determining the optimum access interval time is either based on the frequency of the obtaining command, i.e., inquires made by the SNMP, or on connecting number &ldquo;n&rdquo; of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn, determination for the optimum access interval time is still made based on the connection status of PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Remote monitoring of the network apparatuses using the SNMP is performed under a premise that the monitoring system and managing system communicate one on one. Therefore, there is no consideration of situations when multiple monitoring systems send inquiries to the managing system and such inquiries conflict one another. However, the present invention is the first to solve various problems that arise in the system shared by multiple client terminals (PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn), which perform monitoring of an apparatus such as network image processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also, in this embodiment, PC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PCn display received status information on the display <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, however, other methods such as voice input, e-mail notification, and facsimile communication can be used to notify status information. Also, the managing system is not limited to personal computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be implemented, as it is obvious to person skilled in the art, by using general digital computers and microprocessors that are available in the market, and programmed according to the technology described in the embodiment. Also, as it is obvious to person skilled in the art, the present invention includes computer programs that are programmed by the person skilled in the art, based on the technology described in the above embodiment, i.e., programs in which computers operate as units that compose network image processing apparatus and managing apparatus according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Also, the scope of the present invention includes computer program products that serve as memory media including sending commands that are usable to program computers that executes the present invention. Such memory media include floppy disks, laser disks, CDROM and disks such as magnetic disks, ROM, RAM, EPROM, EEPROM, magnetic laser cards, memory cards and DVD, however, the memory media is not limited to the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various variations and modifications may be possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> This application is based on the Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-200998 filed on Jul. 2, 2001, entire content of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
