<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention discloses a planographic printing plate having a notched portion on its surface having a required size, and having smaller burrs at a rear face, and a planographic printing plate cutting device and a planographic printing plate cutting method for forming such a planographic printing plate by cutting. The planographic printing plate cutting device of the present invention includes an upper roller for forming a recessed section at the planographic printing plate. The upper roller, which is formed substantially into a disc shape as a whole, has a pressing portion parallel to a web (the planographic printing plate), and a slope portion that is slanted with respect to the surface of the web at a predetermined inclination. This upper roller presses the web such that a sloped face (recessed section) that is slanted with respect to the surface of the web is formed. Next, a shearing roller shears the web at the sloped face such that a remaining portion of the sloped face forms a notched portion. Because formation of the notched portion and the shearing process are carried out as separate processes by separate members, a notched portion having a required size can be formed at the surface, and burrs at the rear face can be reduced. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a planographic printing plate machining device, a planographic printing plate machining method and a planographic printing plate, and more particularly, concerns a planographic printing plate capable of improving the appearance of a surface of printed paper, and a planographic printing plate machining device and planographic printing plate machining method for providing such a planographic printing plate through a machining process (in particular, machining at edge portions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a photosensitive planographic printing plate (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;PS plate&rdquo; when appropriate) is manufactured through processes in which a support member, such as an aluminum plate in a sheet shape or a coil shape, is subjected to one or an appropriate combination of surface processes such as graining, anode oxidation, silicate processing and other chemical processes and the like, further subjected to coating of a photosensitive liquid and a drying process, and then cut to a desired size. This PS plate is further subjected to plate-forming processes such as exposure, development, gumming and the like, set in a printing press, and coated with ink. Thus, characters, images, etc. are printed on a surface of paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Printing using such a PS plate may be printing on printing paper that has a size smaller than the size of the PS plate using a general commercial printing press, and may be printing on printing paper that has a size larger than the size of the PS plate, such as, when printing newspapers and the like. In the latter case, because the entire surface of the PS plate is used as a printing surface, ink adhering to cut edges (peripheral portions) of the PS plate may be printed on the printing paper, resulting in stains and consequently reducing commercial value of printed matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With respect to methods for preventing such stains adhering to the surface of printing paper due to unnecessary ink on the PS plate, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 57-46754 discloses a method in which corners of the edges of an aluminum support member are trimmed with a file or a knife, and JP-B No. 62-61946 discloses a method in which insensitive oil is applied to cut edge surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 62-19315, burrs caused during cutting are one of the causes of such stains and thus there are methods for preventing burrs from occurring at the printing surface side. Furthermore, JP-A No. 7-32758 has proposed shaping in which the cut edges are bent toward a side opposite the printing surface and consequent improvements can be seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in the method of trimming corners of edge portions of the support member with a file or a knife, PS plates have to be taken out one by one to be trimmed. Therefore, this method is not appropriate for use in bulk processing. When there are defects, such as burrs and scratches, that cause adhesion of ink is caught at trimmed portions, and may eventually cause stains on the surface of printing paper. Further, in the method of applying an insensitive oil to the cut edge surfaces, PS plates may stick to each other, causing difficulty in handling, and development failures may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, depending on printing conditions, stains may still appear if burrs are simply not caused to occur at the printing paper surface side during cutting. Furthermore, a shape in which the cut edge portions are bent downward (toward the side opposite the printing surface) tends to improve staining but may be a cause of transport failures, such as snagging problems, during transportation at a printing plate forming device that performs exposure and development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, a method has been proposed in which, when a PS plate is sheared with a slitter, cutter, etc., a cutoff is effectively formed at each edge corner portion of a surface treatment layer, at the same time as shearing, by using so-called shearing drops. This method has been respectively disclosed in: JP-A No. 5-104871, JP-A No. 8-11451, JP-A No. 9-53465, JP-A No. 9-323486, JP-A No. 10-35130 and JP-A No. 10-100566 and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, if cutoffs that are effective for preventing stains on the printing paper surface are formed by shear processing using slitters, cutters and the like, large burrs may occur at a rear surface (a surface opposite the surface at which the surface treatment layer is formed). When these burrs protrude from the rear surface, problems such as, the PS plate meandering while being transported in an exposing device or the burrs falling off and becoming garbage occur. Moreover, at the time of shearing, large cracks may occur at the front surface (the surface at which the surface treatment layer is formed), which affects the printed matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, a method has been proposed in which such a machining operation is carried out in a coil manufacturing process. For example, cutoffs are formed in a step prior to formation of the surface treatment layer at the support member. However, in this manufacturing method, processing must be done after setting the coil width for each size of the PS plates. In particular, if the PS plates have a large number of sizes, it is difficult to set the coil width for each the size. Moreover, pluralities of PS plates may be formed from an elongated web in a width direction thereof but the above-described method is capable of producing only one PS plate in the width direction of the web, resulting in a reduction in manufacturing efficiency. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been devised to solve the above-described problems and its object is to provide a planographic printing plate which has smaller burrs generated at a rear face and has a cutoff portion having a sufficient size at a surface, and a planographic printing plate machining device and a planographic printing plate machining method for forming such a planographic printing plate by cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect of the present invention, the planographic printing plate machining device of the present invention is provided with a pressing member which presses and indents a planographic printing plate from the printing side surface, thereby forming a recessed section that has a sloped face which continues from the printing side surface; and a cutting member for cutting the planographic printing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When a planographic printing plate is machined using this planographic printing plate machining device, first, the planographic printing plate is pressed by the pressing member from the surface, with the result that a recessed section having a sloped face which continues from the surface and slants with respect to the surface is formed. Then, the cutting member cuts the planographic printing plate along this recessed section. Therefore, one portion or the whole of the sloped face formed by the pressing member is allowed to remain at the planographic printing plate after cutting, and this remaining sloped face effectively forms a cutoff portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Hence, since formation of the cutoff portion and cutting of the planographic printing plate are carried out using separate respective members, it is not necessary to generate a shearing drop to form a cutoff portion at a time of cutting. Therefore, the planographic printing plate can be cut under conditions that make smaller shearing drops at the time of cutting smaller, thereby making reduction of burrs (or more preferably, elimination of burrs) possible. Moreover, because the pressing process is positively done by the pressing member, a cutoff portion having a required size can be formed easily. In particular, even in the case of a planographic printing plate covered with a surface treatment layer containing, for example, an anode oxidation layer, it is possible to form a cutoff portion having a required size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; refers to cutting process that passes through a planographic printing plate in a plate thickness direction at a predetermined position. For example, this includes any cutting, such as cutting the web of an elongated planographic printing plate along a width direction, or for cutting such an elongated web in a length direction (so-called shearing) and cutting in a diagonal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the position of cutting of the planographic printing plate by the cutting device may be any position within the recessed portion, and is not limited to the sloped face of the recessed portion. For example, in a case wherein a flat face which is parallel to the surface of the planographic printing plate is formed continuously with the sloped face (therefore, the flat face also forms the recessed portion), the planographic printing plate may be cut at this flat face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the present invention, the pressing member is provided with a pressing portion extending in a direction substantially parallel with the printing side surface of a planographic printing plate, for pressing the planographic printing plate from the printing side surface; and a sloped portion that is slanted with respect to the printing side surface of the planographic printing plate so as to form the sloped face when the pressing portion presses the planographic printing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this aspect, because the pressing portion presses the planographic printing plate from a surface side, the planographic printing plate is positively indented to form the recessed portion. Moreover, as the pressing portion presses the planographic printing plate, the sloped portion forms the sloped face at the planographic printing plate. Because the shape of the sloped face (i.e. cutoff) is determined by the sloped portion, a sloped face having a desired shape can be formed by modifying the shape of the sloped portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect of the present invention, the pressing member is provided with the pressing portion includes a contact section that contacts the printing surface side of the planographic printing plate, when the pressing portion presses the planographic printing plate and the sloped portion forms the sloped face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this aspect, when the pressing member presses the planographic printing plate, the contact portion is allowed to contact the surface of the planographic printing plate so that it is possible to prevent lifting of the planographic printing plate, positional offset, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect of the present invention, a supporting member which supports the planographic printing plate is further provided, the recessed section being formed by sandwiching the planographic printing plate between the support member and the pressing member, and the cutting member includes a cutting blade which cuts the planographic printing plate between cutting blade and said supporting member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In other words, the pressing member and the cutting member have the supporting member as a component in common. Consequently, the cutting member can be positioned and made to cut with high precision with respect to the recessed section formed by the pressing member. Moreover, since the supporting member is used in common, the number of constituent parts forming the planographic printing plate machining device is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a fifth aspect of the present invention, the planographic printing plate machining device is provided with a shearing press blade formed to integrally include: a cutting blade section that is capable of cutting the planographic printing plate, thereby forming a cut edge portion; and a recessed section forming section which presses the cut edge portion so as to form a recessed section in the planographic printing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this aspect, the cutting blade section cuts the planographic printing plate, and the recessed section forming section presses the cut edge portion of the planographic printing plate, thereby obtaining a planographic printing plate in which a desired cutoff is formed. Here, the cutting blade section and the recessed section forming section function as the cutting member and the pressing member in the first feature. In other words, in accordance with the present aspect, the shearing member and the pressing member are formed into one shearing press blade. Thus, it is possible to improve machining precision at a time of machining, and also to reduce the number of parts required for machining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a sixth aspect of the present invention, the planographic printing plate machining device is further provided with an expansion permission section, which permits expansion of the planographic printing plate caused by pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this aspect, the planographic printing plate is partially moved by pressing force from the pressing member, and a portion of the planographic printing plate expands and enters the expansion permission section. Hence, expansion due to the movement of the planographic printing plate at the time of pressing is allowed by the expansion permission section. Thus, the surface side of the planographic printing plate is positively pressed and it is possible to form the sloped face even if the pressing force from the pressing member is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a seventh aspect of the present invention, the cutting member cuts the planographic printing plate along an area within the recessed section of the planographic printing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When cutting is done at a plurality of positions (areas) with respect to one recessed section, a portion between the cutting positions becomes chips. However, by cutting the planographic printing plate at one position with respect to one recessed section, such chips are not generated, and the planographic printing plate can be machined without wasting materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In an eighth aspect of the present invention, the planographic printing plate machining method includes a recessed section forming process for pressing and indenting a planographic printing plate from the surface on the printing side to form a recessed section which continues from this surface, and has a sloped face slanting with respect to the surface, and a cutting process for cutting the planographic printing plate at a predetermined cutting position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this planographic printing plate machining method, either of the recessed section forming process and the cutting process may be carried out first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In a case wherein the recessed portion forming process is carried out first, thereof in the recessed section forming process, the planographic printing plate is pressed by the pressing member from the surface so that a recessed section which continues from the surface and has a sloped face slanting with respect to the surface, is formed at the planographic printing plate. Next, in the cutting process, the planographic printing plate is cut at the recessed section. As a result, one portion or the whole of the sloped face formed in the recessed section forming process remains at the planographic printing plate after the cutting process, and this remaining sloped face effectively forms a cutoff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in a case wherein the cutting process is carried out first, the planographic printing plate is first cut to a desired size at a predetermined cutting position. Next, the recessed section is formed by the recessed section forming process at a cut edge portion of the cut planographic printing plate. As a result, a sloped face; i.e. a cutoff, is formed at the edge portion of the planographic printing plate that is finally obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the case wherein the cutting process is carried out first, a planographic printing plate machining device in accordance with, for example, the fifth aspect may be used. In other words, immediately after the cutting blade portion of the cutting press blade cuts the planographic printing plate in the cutting process, the recessed section can be formed with the recessed section forming section of the shearing press blade as the recessed portion forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this aspect, whichever of the recessed section forming process and the cutting process is carried out first, the formation of the cutoff and the cutting of the planographic printing plate are carried out in respectively separate processes. Thus, the cutting process is less susceptible to shearing drops at the time of forming the cutoff. In other words, it is possible to cut the planographic printing plate under conditions that can reduce shearing drops, and consequently to reduce burrs (and more preferably, to eliminate burrs). Moreover, because the sloped face is formed by the recessed portion forming process independently from the cutting process, it is possible to easily form a cutoff portion having a required size. In particular, even in the case of a planographic printing plate covered with a surface treatment layer containing, for example, an anode oxidation layer, it is possible to form a cutoff portion having a required size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a ninth aspect of the present invention, the planographic printing plate is provided with a printing surface and a recessed section having a sloped face that continues from said printing surface, and a sheared surface terminating said recessed section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the case of a planographic printing plate in accordance with this aspect, a desired shape is cut from the recessed section. Thus, of the sloped face of the recessed section, the portion inside the cut section remains to form the cutoff portion. Moreover, the planographic printing plate with the desired shape cut at the recessed section, can be cut under conditions that reduce shearing drops at the time of cutting. Consequently, it is possible to minimize burrs (and more preferably, to eliminate burrs). Because the formation of the sloped face and the cutting process are carried out separately, the planographic printing plate is formed with a cutoff portion having a required size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a planographic printing plate based on the ninth aspect can be machined and manufactured by a planographic printing plate machining method based on the eighth aspect. In the case wherein the recessed section forming process is carried out first, the requirement of cutting at the recessed section can be satisfied by taking into consideration the cutting position at the time of the cutting process. Moreover, in the case wherein the shearing process is carried out first, the requirement of cutting at the recessed portion is effectively satisfied by forming the recessed section at the cut edge portion in the recessed section forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the above aspects, the condition that the sloped face &ldquo;continues&rdquo; is effectively satisfied as long as ink does not adhere at a boundary portion between the sloped face (i.e. the cutoff) and the surface of the planographic printing plate and does not cause any line-shaped stains (so-called edge stains) to be printed on a surface of printing paper. Therefore, in this regard, even in a case when, for example, steps, grooves, etc. are present between the surface of the planographic printing plate and the sloped face, if those steps and grooves are so small that edge stains due to those steps and grooves are not printed on the surface of printing paper, the condition of the present invention that the sloped face &ldquo;continues&rdquo; is effectively satisfied.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for a PS plate having a shearing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is a planographic printing plate machining device of a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> At an upstream side of this machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (upper-right side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), a feeding machine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for successively unwinding a web that has been preliminarily wound up into a roll shape is disposed. The elongated web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, fed from the feeding machine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is subjected to a curl-removing treatment at a leveler <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, reaches a feed roller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at which joining paper <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is affixed and made to closely contact by a static charge, and sent to a notcher <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The notcher <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides a cutout section at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of a pressing roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forming the shearing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of a shearing roller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also forming the shearing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are allowed to shift in the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the position of this cutout. Hence, it is possible to change a trimming width of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the joining paper <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are being continuously sheared together. Hereinafter, &ldquo;width direction&rdquo;, when referred to simply thus, represents the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; and &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside&rdquo; respectively represent an inside and outside in the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A feeding length of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which has been set to a predetermined trimming width in this manner, is subjected to detection by a length-measuring device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and cut by a travelling cutter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a fixed timing. Thus, a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a set size is manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transported to an accumulation section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by a conveyor belt <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a predetermined number are stacked to form an accumulated bundle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Here, at the accumulation section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, protection sheets made of cardboard, etc. (generally, referred to as &ldquo;contact board&rdquo;) may be disposed above and below the accumulated bundle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or at a side thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The accumulated bundles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are stacked on a pallet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> via a transport section <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and then sent to a storage place such as a rack housing, or to a packing process to be packed with packing materials (such as tape, packaging agents, wrapping materials, etc.). Moreover, they can be stacked on skids (plane skids, longitudinal skids, etc.) for use in an automatic printing plate forming machine. In addition, in a case of stacking on these skids and packaging, an accumulating device for accumulating the accumulated bundles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the skids may be provided at the machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and the PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be directly accumulated at skids at the machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be packaged and shipped but, depending on packaging states, the joining paper <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and other packing materials may be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the shearing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided at an upstream side of the transporting direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (the direction of arrow F), and shearing rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> placed at a downstream side from the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed by upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which are disposed at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A side of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at predetermined positions in the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which are disposed at the lower side of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to correspond to the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (Herein, the term &ldquo;surface&rdquo; usually refers to the obverse of a web of printing plate; i.e., the face at which a recessed portion is formed and which is shown toward the top of the drawings). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Here, the numbers of the upper rollers and lower rollers are determined by how many PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are to be formed in the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment exemplifies a case in which two PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed as a row in the width direction, and the following rollers are shown: the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the lower roller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> substantially at the center of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the width direction and the upper rollers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the lower rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at end portions in the width direction. In general, in a case wherein N PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed in the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the number of upper rollers and lower roller units is (N&plus;1). However, in a case wherein no shearing processes are required in the vicinity of end portions in the width direction of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example, because side portions (end portions in the width direction) of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> already have sloped faces <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>), the number of the upper roller and lower roller units is (N&minus;1). Also, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for convenience of explanation, of the upper rollers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the lower rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at both sides, only the upper roller <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the lower roller <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at one side are shown. However, the upper roller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the lower roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are symmetrically disposed at the left side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the center is substantially disc shaped as a whole, and a pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which has a fixed radius and a width (length in the axial direction) W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is formed at the center in the axial direction of the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. An angle made by a peripheral face of the pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be selected as appropriate but the peripheral face and the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A are preferably parallel with each other. Moreover, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be shaped to provide a plurality of steps in order to deform a material (aluminum) more easily with a protruding portion <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, which is formed protruding further outward in a radial direction at the center of the pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> From each of both axial direction sides of the pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a truncated cone shaped slope portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> whose radius decreases distally is formed. A peripheral face of the slope portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed into a predetermined shape such that the lowest portion thereof has a slope with a fixed inclination &thgr; with respect to the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The upper rollers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on end portions may have the same shape as the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the center, or may have a different shape, formed by a pressing section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a slope portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> having a truncated cone shape whose radius decreases toward the inner side from the pressing section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In the same manner as the pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the pressing section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is usually parallel with the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and one portion is partially reaches into the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in the same manner as the slope portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the peripheral face of the slope portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is formed into a shape such that the lowest portion thereof has a slope with a fixed inclination &thgr; with respect to the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are respectively fixed to a shaft <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and rotate in the same direction at the same speed as the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The lower roller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, provided in correspondence with the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the center, is formed by two receive rollers <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that are disposed with a fixed spacing. The gap between these receive rollers <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be selected appropriately to the shape of the PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that are finally produced. Moreover, this gap forms an escape section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which allows movement of the material of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and receives a portion of the material (aluminum) that is pressed and deformed by the pressing roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The lower rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, provided in correspondence with the end portion upper rollers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, are offset inward from the upper rollers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Hence, an escape section <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, which allows movement of the material of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and receives a portion of the material that is pressed and deformed by the upper rollers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is formed outside each of the lower rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> All of the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have substantially the same diameter, and the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is transported on these lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> with a photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> facing up (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>). The web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is pressed by the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> while being transported such that at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which continues from the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and has a slope with a fixed inclination &thgr; with respect to the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, and flat faces <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> corresponding to the pressing sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are formed. Further, the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are attached to a shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and allowed to rotate in an opposite direction to the direction of rotation of the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the same speed as the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Here, each of the shafts <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be formed as one shaft, or may be formed divided in the width direction (the length direction of the shafts <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) for the respective upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In general, divided shafts <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> make setting conditions of the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> easier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The shearing rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are provided with upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> corresponding to the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> corresponding the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, of the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the upper blade <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at the center is set such that the lowest portion of a peripheral face thereof is positioned below a rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a width (length in the axial direction) of the upper blade <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is set to a predetermined width such that, with respect to the sloped faces <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each of both ends in the axial direction of the upper blade <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is positioned substantially in the center in the width direction of a sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the same manner as the upper blade <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at the center, each of the upper blades <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the end portions is set such that the lowest portion of a peripheral face thereof is positioned below the rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

Further, the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are attached to a shaft <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and allowed to rotate in an opposite direction to the direction of rotation of the upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the same speed as the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Here, each of the shafts <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be formed as one shaft, or may be formed divided in the width direction (the length direction of the shafts <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>) for the respective upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In general, divided shafts <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> make setting conditions of the upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> easier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of a method for shearing (cutting) the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the shearing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment having the above-mentioned structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, transported at the machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, is transported while being supported by the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> forming the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At this time, the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotate and press the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the upper side. Thus, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is partially deformed to form, at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> having a flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> corresponding to the pressing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> corresponding to the slope portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (recessed section forming process). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Here, the support member (aluminum) of the deformed web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> enters the escape sections <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> formed by the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Thus, deformation movements of the support member of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are allowed and, even if a pressing force (machining force) of the upper rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is small, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be reliably deformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having had the recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> formed at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A thus is further transported and reaches the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Here, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is transported while being supported by the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> Then, shearing force is applied when the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is gripped between the upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by rotation of the upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a vicinity thereof (a portion of each sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) are partially cut off. Thus, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sheared at a predetermined position in the width direction (cutting process), and cutoff portions become a cutout scrap <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. At this time, the upper blades <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shear the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a position substantially at the center of the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Therefore, of the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed by the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a remaining portion (a portion integrally continuing with the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) not having been cut off by the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> becomes a cutoff <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>) of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the pressing process, a portion of the support member enters the escape section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and protrudes from the rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; however, because all of this protruding portion is separated from the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the shearing process, no parts of the protruding portion remain to form burrs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conveyor belt <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for transporting the scrap <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and a collecting box <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for collecting the scrap <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> transported by the conveyor belt <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> maybe installed at the machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Further, a winding device (not shown) may be provided to successively wind up the scrap <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> into a roll shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, sheared at a predetermined position thus, is further transported and sheared by a travelling cutter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, providing PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a desired size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the shearing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, the process for forming the recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> having the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the shearing (cutting) process for cutting the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a predetermined position are carried out as separate processes using separate devices. Thus, in the cutting process, it is possible to obtain a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a desired cutoff <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> without forming so-called shearing drops. In other words, in the cutting process, shearing can be done under shearing conditions that can reduce (and more preferably, eliminate) shearing drops, and consequently to reduce (and more preferably, eliminate) burrs at a rear face of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Because the desired cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is formed at the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the surface of printing paper is free from adherence of unnecessary ink when this PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used for printing, and thus high quality of printed matter can be maintained. Moreover, since burrs are reduced at the rear face, the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> does not meander and burrs do not fall off as garbage, when, for example, the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transported inside an exposing device. Thus, the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has superior handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a pressing roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the center in the width direction of pressing rollers related to a second embodiment of the present invention. In the second embodiment, only the structure of the pressing rollers is different from the first embodiment. Therefore, explanation will be given only of the pressing rollers, and explanation of other members will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> An upper roller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that forms this pressing roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is only provided with a pressing section <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which is similar to the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment, and has no portion corresponding to the sloped portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Further, as in the first embodiment, a radius of the pressing section <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is set to a fixed value such that a portion of the upper roller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> reaches into the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during transportation. Moreover, a width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the upper roller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (that is, the width of the pressing section <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) is set to a fixed width based upon a relationship between a trimming width of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a machining force at the time of shearing and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A lower roller <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that forms the pressing roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed by two support rollers <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> disposed apart by a K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is wider than the width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the upper roller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The gap between these support rollers <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is an escape section <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> which the support member of the deformed web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> enters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Also, besides the pressing roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the center in the width direction, pressing rollers are formed at end portions, with only pressing sections formed at the upper roller, and no sloped portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment having such a pressing roller, when the upper roller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> rotates and presses the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> transported thereto, not only the portion directly pressed by the pressing section <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (flat face <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>), but also portions of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> corresponding to both sides of the pressing section <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, are deformed, with the result that a recessed section <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> having a sloped faces <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the first embodiment is formed at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the support member (aluminum) of the deformed web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is allowed to enter the escape section <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> formed by the lower roller <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, deformation movements of the support member of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are allowed and the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be reliably deformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In this manner, as compared with the first embodiment, the second embodiment can form the sloped faces <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the simpler upper roller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Here, depending on materials to be machined, the sloped faces <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be formed at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> even under the condition of K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&gE;W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a desired shape can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a pressing roller <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> at the center in the width direction of pressing rollers related to a third embodiment of the present invention. In the third embodiment, as in the second embodiment, only the structure of the pressing rollers is different. Therefore, explanation will be given only of the pressing rollers, and explanation of the other members will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In an upper roller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> forming the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, in addition to a pressing section <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and slope portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that are the same as at the upper roller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment, a disc-shaped contact portion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> having a predetermined radius is formed from an axial direction end of each sloped portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The contact portion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is at a predetermined position such that the lowest portion of a peripheral face of the contact portion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> contacts without pressing the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the transported web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a lower roller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, that forms the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is formed by one roller whose width is substantially the same as the upper roller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. No portions corresponding to the escape portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>) are provided. Of course, escape portions may be provided therein in the same manner as in the first and second embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Also, besides the pressing roller <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> at the center in the width direction, pressing upper rollers that each have a sloped portion and a contact portion formed in succession from the pressing section inward and the lower rollers are each formed by a disc-shaped roller having a predetermined radius are pressing rollers at end portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment having such pressing rollers <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, when the upper roller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> rotates and presses the transported web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, recessed sections <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> having flat faces <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and sloped faces <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are formed at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in the same manner as in the first embodiment. At this time, the contact portion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, even if a lifting force is exerted at portions at both sides, of the recessed section of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> because of pressing force applied at the pressing section <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, these portions are kept down by the contact portion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and are not raised. Hence, the sloped faces <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> can be formed with high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a shearing section <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which is a planographic printing plate machining device of a fourth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the fourth embodiment, an upper roller <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that forms pressing rollers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> has the same structure as in the first embodiment. In the same manner, an upper blade <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> that forms shearing rollers <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> also has the same structure as in the first embodiment. Further, a lower roller forming the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and a lower blade forming the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> are integrally provided as a pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, in which respect this embodiment is different from the first embodiment. Thus, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is gripped between the upper roller <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and the pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> while being supported by the pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the same manner as the first embodiment, a recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) having a sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is formed. The web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is transported while being curved in a state of planar contact with the pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, gripped between the upper blade <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, and cut at the position df the recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this manner, at the shearing section <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment, the pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is provided such that the lower rollers of the pressing roller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and the lower blade of the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> are formed by a common member. Thus, precision of pressing positions of the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and shearing positions of the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> can be improved (positional offsets are reduced). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Moreover, because each lower roller of the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and each lower blade of the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> have been made a common member, the number of parts is reduced as compared with cases in which these members are formed as separate members, and a structure for rotating these members can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the fourth embodiment, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made to planarly-contact the pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the contact area is wider compared with the first to third embodiments. Thus, because frictional force between the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the pressing and shearing roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is increased compared with cases of point contact, it is possible to prevent meandering and oscillation of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during transport, and consequently to transport the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Also, in the shearing section <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment, the upper roller <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that forms the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> does not necessarily have the same structure as in the first embodiment and, for example, it may have the same structure as in the second embodiment (a shape having no slope section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) or the same structure as in the third embodiment (a shape having a contact portion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an enlarged shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of a shearing section that forms a planographic printing plate machining device of a fifth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> This shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is formed as a whole into a truncated cone shape with a peripheral edge thereof being a shearing blade portion <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a slope section <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> whose diameter is gradually reduced inward (to the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) is formed at an inner side from the shearing blade portion <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> in the radial direction (an upper side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). Further, an escape recess <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is formed continuing from the slope section <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> as a partially thinner portion extending toward the outside of the shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in correspondence with the shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, a lower roller <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> having a predetermined spacing from the shearing blade portion <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the shearing section of the fifth embodiment having the above-described structure, the shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> continuously performs shearing of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and formation of the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In other words, first, rotation of the shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> allows the shearing blade portion <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to cut the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a predetermined position, and then the slope section <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> presses the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the surface side to form the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. At this time, deformation movement of the pressed web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is permitted, by aluminum forming the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being allowed to enter the escape recess <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sloped face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be formed even by a small pressing force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the shearing section of the fifth embodiment, one shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and one lower roller <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> carry out the cutting of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and formation of the slope section <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Therefore, precision between a shearing position of the shearing blade portion <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and a pressing position of the slope section <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> can be improved (positional offsets are reduced). Moreover, compared with the first to fourth embodiments, the number of parts is further reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in examples of the above-mentioned first to fourth embodiments, the slope section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>) is formed with a straight shape in cross section. However, with respect to shape of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, the shapes of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> that can be formed by the planographic printing plate machining device of the present invention are, of course, not intended to be limited to this shape. That is, any shape may be used as long as unnecessary ink does not adhere thereto at the time of printing. For example, as described in the fifth embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), the end face of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> may be shaped into a curved line in cross section, or may be formed into a shape without a bent portion (a border portion between a slope section and a flat section). Moreover, the angle made by the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A of the planographic printing PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not particularly limited. Such a modification in the shape of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> may be easily made by, for example, changing the shape of the slope sections <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in the shearing sections in the first embodiment and the third embodiment. Further, in the shearing section of the second embodiment, a cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> having a desired shape can be formed by setting pressing conditions with consideration of hardness and the like of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a plurality of sloped faces that are inclined with respectively different inclinations may be formed around the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so as to form a recessed section including these sloped faces. In this case, border portions of the sloped faces may form convex shapes concave shapes toward the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, in a case wherein a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having such sloped faces is manufactured, for example, a plurality of pressing rollers may be used in correspondence with the plurality of sloped faces, or one kind of pressing roller, forming a plurality of sloped faces, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In addition, by changing shapes, pressing conditions and shearing conditions of the members that form the pressing rollers and the shearing rollers as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A, a</cross-reference> sloped face <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may be formed at a cut edge of a rear face of a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, the entire PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be curved (including the rear surface). By forming the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into such shapes, it becomes possible to further prevent generation of edge stains. With respect to burrs on the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, burrs are allowable within such a range that they do not affect staining of printing paper and handling (transportability and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention, an angle of a cut surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C with the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not limited to 90&deg;. An acute angle as indicated by a solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference> or, in contrast, an obtuse angle as indicated by a dot-dot-dash line, may be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the above-described cutting process, the flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and neighboring portions are cut off (cutting at two places). However, cutting may be carried out at only one place to divide the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without cutting off. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, by carrying out cutting so as to divide the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a position corresponding to the flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having across-sectional shape, indicated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> (where the flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> remains), may be formed. In this case, it is preferable to cut the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> substantially at the center in the width direction of the flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. However, cutting is not limited thus and it is possible to select a desired cutting position within the range of the flat face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Moreover, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, when the shape of the recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is preliminarily formed into a shape formed only by sloped faces <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (without having a flat face), the recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> may be sheared at a bottom portion (a position having the thinnest thickness of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) to form a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</cross-reference>. In any of these shearing methods, because the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not cut off, cutout scraps <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> are not generated and yield is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in cases wherein the process for forming the sloped face <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>) at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the process for shearing (cutting) the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a desired shape are provided as separate processes, the order of these processes is not particularly limited. For example, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be first sheared (cut), and then the sloped face <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>) may be formed at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The aforementioned fifth embodiment exemplifies such a case in which the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cut first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Applicable examples of the planographic printing plate machining device of the present invention include not only the shearing sections as described in the respective embodiments above, but any device for shearing planographic printing plates. For example, the planographic printing plate machining device of the present invention may be applied as the travelling cutter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for cutting the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the width direction. This case can be exemplified by a structure in which pressing blades (pressing upper blades and pressing lower blades) having the same cross-sectional shape as the pressing rollers described in any one of the above-described embodiments are provided to pass across the entire width of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and, at a downstream side thereof, cutting blades (cutting upper blades and cutting lower blades) having the same cross-sectional shape as shearing blades described in any one of the above-described embodiments are provided to pass across the entire width of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the same manner. In such a structure, a method can be found in which, for example, the pressing upper blades are moved up and down so as to form recessed sections having sloped faces at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and in a next process, the cutting upper blades are moved up and down so that the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sheared in the width direction at the sloped faces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Further, at the shearing sections of the first to third embodiments, for example, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is usually transported in a flat plane. However, in these embodiments, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be transported in a curved manner along the transporting direction, in the same manner as in the fourth embodiment. In particular, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is curved downward at an upstream side of the pressing rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and at a downstream side of the shearing rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has an increased contact area with the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Thus, frictional force between the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the lower rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the lower blades <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> increases, meandering and oscillation of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during transport can be prevented, and the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be transported more stably. Similarly, in the fifth embodiment, the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be curved in the same manner as in the fourth embodiment to make planar with the lower roller <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Moreover, holding members, such as a belt that supports the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while being moved at the same travelling speed as the transporting speed of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, fingers, ring spacers, etc. may be provided at the machining line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to transport the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> more stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the planographic printing plate machining device and planographic printing plate machining method of the present invention may be applied not only at the above-described machining line in which a web that has been coated with a photosensitive layer, and wound up into a coil is successively fed and processed, but also to machining lines incorporating various processes, such as a line in which a web is coated with a photosensitive layer and continuously machined without being wound up, a line in which a web is wound up into a coil after having been machined, a line in which, after having been cut into master sheets, a web is further cut into sheets so as to have dimensions of a final product to be shipped, and the like. Transportation of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not limited to a machining line that transports the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> facing up. A machining line may transport the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> facing down, a machining line may transport the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a vertical position with its width direction oriented vertically, and the like. That is, a transportation state of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not particularly limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the planographic printing plate machining device and planographic printing plate machining method of the present invention may also be applied to an aluminum coil prior to surface treatment. Moreover, the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present application may be subjected to an insensitivity treatment before or after a plate forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be PS plates used in general printing (such as commercial printing and newspaper printing), for example, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 10-100556, and besides those PS plates, maybe PS plates used as so-called waste plates; for example, as proposed by the applicant of the present application in Japanese Patent Application No. 10-42014. In a case when the PS plate is used as a waste plate, the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is not necessary, or omitted by preference. Therefore, the PS plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention include PS plates not coated with a photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Moreover, photosensitive layers <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> may be applied to both of surfaces of an aluminum support member. In the case of a PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a support member coated with photosensitive layers <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> on both of the surfaces, a cross-sectional shape, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> makes it possible to eliminate edge stains, even when either of the surfaces is used for printing. Moreover, the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention also includes PS plates used in digital printing such as photopolymer, thermal and other processes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The following description will further explain the present invention in detail by means of examples. However, the present invention is, of course, not intended to be limited by these examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> shows specific values of shearing sections, cross-sectional shapes and degrees of staining (stains due to unnecessary ink transferred onto the surface of printing paper) when the webs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are sheared using the shearing sections of the first to fifth embodiments of the present invention and conventional shearing section (slitter). A conventional shearing section is a shearing section that is structured so as to form a cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> at the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by producing a shearing drop simultaneously with the shearing process, without carrying out the pressing process and the shearing process at the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> separately as in the present invention. Moreover, examples 1 to 5 in the Table correspond respectively to the first to fifth embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Amount of push P in this Table refers to the distance between the lowest portion of the upper roller (a portion pushed into the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the recessed section forming process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Further, clearance C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the recessed section forming process refers to a distance in the width direction between the end face of the pressing section of the upper roller and the end face of the escape section formed by the lower rollers and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in a cases where there is a gap, the clearance is defined as positive. In the case of the third embodiment of the present invention (example 3) which has no escape section (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), no clearance is set. Moreover, in the fifth embodiment of the present invention (example 5), only one shearing and pressing blade <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is used to shear the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (the shearing process) and form the recessed section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (the recessed section forming process). Therefore, because the respective values in the recessed section forming process are the same as respective values in the shearing process, the values for the recessed section forming process are omitted. Further, in the case of the conventional shearing section (slitter), because there is no pressing process, no numeric values are listed for a pressing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Mesh&rdquo; in this Table refers to a distance between the lowest portion of the upper blade and the rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the shearing process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</cross-reference>. Moreover, clearance in the shearing process refers to a distance in the width direction between the end face of the upper blade and the end face of the lower blade. In the fourth embodiment of the present invention (example 4), since the lower roller and the lower blade are integrally provided as the shearing press roller <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the diameter of the lower blade in the shearing process is the same as the diameter of the lower roller in the recessed section forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A, X</cross-reference> and Y in the Table respectively refer to width and depth of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the sheared PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and B refers to an amount of protrusion of burrs from the rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the respective &ldquo;slitter conditions&rdquo; in the Table refer to cases in which shearing is carried out with respective conditions at the shearing section appropriately set such that the width X and the depth Y of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> have the values shown in the Table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Also, in the Table, symbols &ldquo;&xcirc;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&Dgr;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&xcirc;&Dgr;&rdquo;, and &ldquo;X&rdquo; respectively represent the following states: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> &xcirc;: No edge stains occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> &Dgr;: Edge stains faintly or partially occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> &xcirc;&Dgr;: The length and visibility of edge stains is in an intermediate state between the above-mentioned &xcirc; and &Dgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> X: Edge stains clearly appear as lines around the entire periphery of printing paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As material to be evaluated in the present examples, PS plates were prepared and used as follows. An aluminum material (JIS-A1050), which contains 99.5% by weight of aluminum, 0.01% by weight of copper, 0.03% by weight of titanium, 0.3% by weight of iron and 0.1% by weight of silicon, was formed into a rolled plate of 0.30 mm thickness, subjected to graining at the surface using an aqueous suspension containing 20% by weight of Pumicetone (made by Kyoritsu Yogyo K. K.) of 400 mesh and rotary nylon brushes (6, 10-nylon), and thoroughly washed with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The material was immersed in an aqueous solution containing 15% by weight of sodium hydroxide (containing 4.5% by weight of aluminum) to be etched such that a dissolved amount of aluminum was 5 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and then washed with flowing water. Further, the plate was neutralized by 1% by weight nitric acid, and then subjected to an electrolytic surface-roughening treatment using a voltage having a rectangular alternating waveform (current ratio r&equals;0.90, a current waveform described in an embodiment of Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 58-5796) having an anode voltage of 10.5 V and a cathode voltage of 9.3 V, with an anode charge of 160 Coulomb/d m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, in an aqueous solution containing 0.7% by weight of nitric acid (containing 0.5% by weight of aluminum). After having been washed, the material was immersed in an aqueous solution containing 10% by weight of sodium hydroxide at 35&deg; C. to be etched such that a dissolved amount of aluminum was 1 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and then washed. Next, this was subjected to treatment by being immersed in an aqueous solution containing 30% by weight of sulfuric acid at 50&deg; C., and then washed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Further, the material was subjected to a porous anode oxidation coating film forming process using a DC current in an aqueous solution containing 20% by weight of sulfuric acid (containing 0.8% by weight of aluminum) at 35&deg; C. Specifically, an electrolysis process was carried out at a current density of 13 A/dm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and an anode oxidation coating film of 2.7 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>was obtained by adjusting the duration of electrolysis. In order to form a negative-type photosensitive planographic printing plate by using a diazo resin and a binder, this support member was washed with water, immersed in an aqueous solution containing 3% by weight of sodium silicate at 70&deg; C. for 30 seconds, and then washed and dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The aluminum support member obtained as described above had a reflection density of 0.30 as measured by a Macbeth RD920 reflection densitometer, and a center line average roughness Ra of 0.58 &mgr;m, as standardized by JIS B00601. Next, the support member was coated with an aqueous solution containing 1.0% by weight of a copolymer of methylmethacrylate/ethylacrylate/2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sodium sulfonate (an average molecular weight of approximately 60,000)(mole ratio 50/30/20) by a roll coater such that the amount of coating after drying, was at 0.05 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Further, the following photosensitive liquid-1 was applied using a bar coater, and dried at 110&deg; C. for 45 seconds. The amount of coating was 2.0 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>dry weight. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned diazo resin-1 was obtained as follows: First, 29.4 g of 4-diazodiphenylamine sulfate (purity 99.5%) was gradually added to 70 ml of 96% sulfuric acid at 25&deg; C., and stirred for 20 minutes. To the resulting mixture 3.26 g of para-formaldehyde (purity 92%) was gradually added over approximately 10 minutes, and mixture was stirred at 30&deg; C. for four hours to cause a condensation reaction to proceed. Here, the condensation mole ratio of the above-mentioned diazo compound and formaldehyde was 1:1. The resulting reaction product was poured into 2 liters of water with ice while being stirred, and then subjected to treatment with a chilled strong aqueous solution in which 130 g of sodium chloride has been dissolved. The resulting precipitate was collected by suction filtering, and partially dried solid matter was dissolved in 1 liter of water, filtered, cooled with ice, and treated with an aqueous solution in which 23 g of potassium hexafluorophosphate had been dissolved. Lastly, the resulting precipitate was filtered, collected, and air-dried. Thus, diazo resin-1 was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Binder-1 was a non-water soluble, alkaline-water soluble coating forming high polymer compound which was a copolymer of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate/acrylonitrile/methylmethacrylate/methacrylic acid (weight ratio: 50/20/26/4, average molecular weight: 75,000, acid content: 0.4 meq/g). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> STILITE HS-2 (made by Daido Kogyo (K.

A mat layer-forming resin liquid was sprayed as described below onto the surface of a photosensitive layer formed as described above in the following method so as to form a mat layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> An aqueous solution of 12% of a copolymer of methylmethacrylate/ethylacrylate/2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonate (charged weight ratio 65:20:15), a portion of which was converted to sodium salt, was prepared as the mat layer-forming resin liquid. Vapor of this resin liquid was sprayed by a rotary atomizing electrostatic coating device at the photosensitive layer for 2.5 seconds of liquid application, to moisten the coating face. An atomizing head rotated at 25,000 rpm, supply of the resin liquid 4.0 ml/min., an applied voltage at the atomizing head&mdash;90 kV, ambient temperature was 25&deg; C. at the time of coating and relative humidity was 50%. Then, three seconds after moistening, the coating was subjected to a hot air flow with a humidity of 10% at 60&deg; C. for five seconds so as to be dried. The mat had an average height of approximately 6 &mgr;m, an average size of approximately 30 &mgr;m and a coating amount of 150 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> A coiled web having a plate thickness of 0.3 mm and a width of 820 mm, thus obtained, was machined on a machining line under various conditions to be changed to a width of 400 mm, and sheets of PS plates having a cut length of 1100 mm were obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In order to carry out evaluation of printing, the sheets thus formed were subjected to image exposure, and were developed with a liquid formed by diluting DN-3C (an alkaline aqueous solution developer made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) with water at 1:1, using an 800 H (an automatic developing device made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). GN (a gum made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) was used as a finisher, after dilution with water to 1:1 and was applied to the sheet immediately after developing, and then dried. Thus, plate formation was completed. 20,000 printing plates were printed at a speed of 100,000 plates/hour using an offset rotary printing machine with magenta ink, which is susceptible to crack stains. Thus, stains at the end portions were evaluated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from this Table, in conventional shearing sections; for example, in a case when the cutting was done under such conditions as to prevent burrs (slitter condition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), because the width X and depth Y of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> were inevitably reduced, edge stains occurred. Moreover, in a case when the cutting was done under such conditions as to increase the width X and depth Y of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> (slitter condition <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), although edge stains were alleviated as compared with slitter condition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the amount of protrusion B of burrs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> became greater. In a case when the depth of the notch <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> was made greater (slitter condition <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), cracks occurred at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A (the surface treatment layer) of the PS plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, resulting in edge stains. Moreover, the amount of protrusion B of burrs became even greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in the case of the first embodiment of the present invention, because sufficient sizes of the width X and the depth Y of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> were provided, edge stains were reduced to a degree at which no problem would arise in practical use, and there were no burrs at all at the rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B. Moreover, in the cases of the second and third embodiments, because even larger sizes of the width X and depth Y of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> were provided, edge stains were completely eliminated, and the amount of protrusion of burrs B at the rear face <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B was reduced to a degree at which no problem would arise in practical use. Furthermore, in the case of the fourth embodiment, similar sizes to the first embodiment of the width X and depth Y of the cutoff portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> were obtained, and no edge stains occurred. In the fifth embodiment, edge stains were reduced to a degree at which no problem would arise in practical use, and the amount of protrusion of burrs as compared with the conventional shearing section (slitter) was reduced. </paragraph>
