<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, in an elongated rod-like member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> such as a handle of a cleaning tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> handle of a stick and the like is occasionally formed by connecting a plurality of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having a predetermined length integrally in an axial direction. As a structure of a connecting portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for integrally connecting the circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, for example, there is known a structure in which a female screw element having a female screw on an internal peripheral surface thereof is attached to an opening in each end portion of, a pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to be connected together and the pair of female screw elements are placed in opposing relation to each other and a male screw element having a male screw on an outer peripheral surface thereof is threadingly engaged with the two female screw elements so that the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are integrally joined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to a structure of the above-mentioned conventional connecting portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, in addition to the threading engagement between the female screw elements and the male screw element, the male screw is prevented from getting loosened by frictional force between end faces of the male and female screw elements abutted with each other in opposing relation. Accordingly, when a bending stress is applied to the connecting portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a gap is generated between the abutting end faces. As a result, a frictional force is no longer obtained and the threading engagement relation between the female screw elements and the male screw elements tends to be loosened. Moreover, the connecting portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is bent and readily broken. Besides, according to a structure of the conventional connecting portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the structure is complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to a structure of the conventional connecting portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, since the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are connected by threadingly engaging the male screw element with the female screw elements, the work for integrally connecting the pipes necessitates time and labor. Particularly, a connecting operation in a dark place becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a pipe connecting structure and a cleaning tool using the pipe connecting structure, in which a connecting portion can effectively be prevented from being loosened and broken even in the case where a bending stress is applied thereto and in which a pair of sleeve-like pipes can easily be connected integrally in an axial direction with a simple structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provided a pipe connecting structure and a cleaning tool using the pipe connecting structure, in which a pair of sleeve-like pipes can easily be connected integrally in an axial direction by means of a simple operation and in which a connecting operation can be performed smoothly even in a dark place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a pipe connecting structure and a cleaning tool using the pipe connecting structure, in which an integrally connected pair of sleeve-like pipes can smoothly be disassembled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A pipe connecting structure according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is employed at the time for connecting, integrally in an axial direction, a plurality of circular sleeve-like pipes constituting a handle of a cleaning tool which comprises a cleaning plate attached with a cleaning sheet member for wiping a floor surface, etc., for example, and the handle extending from the cleaning plate (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). For the sake of convenience of transportation and sales, the cleaning tool is designed such that it can be disassembled into component parts such as a cleaning plate, a circular sleeve-like pipe and the like. And those component parts are produced as a group. At the time of use, those component parts are assembled. At the time of storage or disposal, the cleaning tool is disassembled into those component parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A pipe connecting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment is employed at connecting sections of the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes which constitute a handle composed of a plurality of circular sleeve-like pipes. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a circular male side protrusion insertion hole (male side protrusion engagement hole) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of one circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into a distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of a female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a circular female side insertion hole (female side protrusion engagement hole) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to serve as a connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are brought into coincident alignment with each other, the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which has been biased radially inwardly is inserted in the protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from outside and engaged therewith, and such an engagement state of the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is retained by pressing the engagement protrusion with a sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as an engagement retainer means. By doing so, the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected integrally in an axial direction X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed, respectively, in the end portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which constitute the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A cutout <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed on the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Owing to the cutout <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serves as a resilient portion which is deformed radially outwardly as a whole to thereby generate a biasing force in a radially inwardly. The protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the end portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are brought into coincident alignment with each other and the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is integrally formed on an inner peripheral surface of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is inserted into the coincided protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the outside of the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and engaged therewith. The engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is then pressed with the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the engagement state of the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is firmly retained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is projectingly formed with a guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extending in the axial direction X of the circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> formed in an outer peripheral surface thereof and extending in the axial direction X of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from its distal end edge portion to the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the time of inserting the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is inserted into the female side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from outside and allowed to be projected inside. In that state, the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is brought into engagement with the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and then slidingly moved towards the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. By doing so, the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is guided into the coincided protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and lockingly engaged therewith (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). The male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the female side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> have an inside diameter generally equal to the outside diameter of the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Both the circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are hollow-interior pipe members which are made of metal (aluminum) and which have a circular cross section. The male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is reduced in diameter. This male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a reduced diameter is inserted into the distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a dual structure in which the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is tightly overlapped with the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Owing to this arrangement, the handle is more enhanced in connecting strength compared with the conventional connecting structure using a screw and in addition, play can be prevented from occurring at the time of cleaning operation. It is also accepted that the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has such a circular cross section in which its outside diameter is generally equal to the inside diameter of the female side end portion. By using such a pipe as just mentioned, the male side end portion can be inserted into the opening of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> without reducing its diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an outer peripheral surface which is initially reduced in diameter with a steep gradient and then gradually reduced in diameter towards the distal end with a gentle gradient. The female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is enlarged in diameter towards the distal end with a gentle gradient coincident with the gradient of the above-mentioned end portion which is reduced in diameter. Accordingly, the reduced-diameter portion of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into the distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> until its base end of steep gradient portion is brought into abutment with the opening edge portion. By doing so, the end portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be tightly contacted with each other with ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed in such locations that the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can easily be brought into coincident alignment with the protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by fully inserting the reduced-diameter portion of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> up to its base end portion into the distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> arranged in such a manner as to cover the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is made of, for example synthetic resin (plastics). The sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> composed of a circular sleeve-like member having an inside diameter large enough to cover the periphery of the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a tightly contacted manner, and the circular engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> integrally formed on and projecting from an inner surface of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The cutout <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed in the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> over the entire length of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in an axial direction. The sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is resiliently deformed outwardly in a radial direction as the width of the cutout <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is spread in the circumferential direction. As a result, the sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is enlarged in diameter. Thus, the overall sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> constitutes a resilient portion which is deformed outwardly in the radial direction to thereby generate a biasing force inwardly in the radial direction. Accordingly, at the time of attaching the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to cover the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> integrally formed on the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be biased inwardly in the radial direction by the resilient force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a base portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the form of a drum-like projections having a circular configuration in section. The engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is integral with the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is made of synthetic resin and which is attached in such a manner as to cover the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> protrudes inwardly in a radial direction from an inner surface of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> formed on the inner end portion thereof in such a manner as to traverse the center of the base portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and projecting further inward. The guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a width just enough to be matingly engaged with and slidingly moved along the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the side towards the distal end of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is tapered downward towards the distal end. By virtue of a provision of this tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the connecting resistance between the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be reduced at the time of connection. Therefore, a smooth connecting operation can be obtained. The base portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also has a tapered surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which is likewise tapered downward towards the distal end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed by linearly depressing the outer peripheral surface of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a reduced diameter, such that the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> linearly extends in the axial direction X of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the distal end edge portion of the pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a shallow rectangular or trapezoidal configuration in section. The width of a bottom surface of the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than that of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. By this, the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can smoothly be guided to the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a stable manner and without allowing it to escape from the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an annular tapered surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which is formed along its distal end peripheral edge. The annular tapered surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> including a distal end edge portion of the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is tapered inward towards the distal end side. At the time of connecting operation, as later described, of the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is brought into abutment with the annular tapered surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are rotated relative to each other. By doing so, the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be guided into the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In order to connect the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> integrally in the axial direction X, first, the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached to the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to cover the outer peripheral surface of the distal end portion of the pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is inserted into the female side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that an inner portion of the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> including the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> projects from the inner surface of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The inside diameter of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while spreading the width of the cutout <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction and resiliently deforming the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to enlarge its diameter. By doing so, the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is biased inwardly in the radial direction and projected from the inner surface of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the tapered surfaces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> directed to the distal end side of the pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Then, the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a reduced diameter of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into the distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. By doing so, the distal end peripheral edge portion of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is brought into abutment with the distal end face of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see the portion indicated by a broken line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) projecting inwardly from the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the annular tapered surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> where the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not formed, for example. With the abutment force in a direction of insertion along the axial direction X retained, when the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is then rotated relative to the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is brought to that area of the annular tapered surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> where the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed and the tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is engaged with and abutted with the annular tapered surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> at that area where the stepped part of the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located (see the portion indicated by a solid line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). By this, the location of the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can easily and clearly be manually recognized and the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can precisely and assuredly move along the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a reduced diameter of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted further into the distal end opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rides over the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while resiliently deforming the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and smoothly moves towards the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). When the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> reaches the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is pushed down by resilient force directing inwardly in the radial direction of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is inserted into the male side protrusion insertion hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side so that it is lockingly engaged with the coincided protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> easily and smoothly (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). By this, the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can have a rigid connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a dual structure in which the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the female side end portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are overlapped with each other in a tightly contacted state. Since the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is covered up and pressed with the sleeve body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the engagement state of the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is easily and assuredly retained without allowing the engagement protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to escape from the protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> That is to say, according to this embodiment, the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can easily integrally be connected together in the axial direction through a simple structure and operation. Moreover, the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be brought into engagement with the guide groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by manual feel and therefore, the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can easily be connected by correctly positioning them even in a dark place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, since the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a dual structure in which the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the other circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are tightly contacted with each other over a certain length (25 mm in this embodiment), the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can effectively be prevented from being loosened and broken because, even if a large bending stress is applied to the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> during the use of the cleaning tool or the like, such a large bending stress is fully absorbed by a lapping portion of the dual structure. Particularly, since the circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are composed of a metal pipe member, a more firm supporting force can be applied against the bending force. Hence, according to this embodiment, the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can effectively be prevented from being loosened and broken even if a large bending stress is applied to the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The engagement protrusion to be inserted into and engaged with the protrusion insertion hole is not necessarily integral with the inner surface of the sleeve body. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is also accepted that a circular protrusion element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> made of stainless steel, which is formed as a separate member from the sleeve body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, is inserted into the protrusion insertion holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which have been brought into coincident with each other at the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and engaged therewith, and then the circular protrusion element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pressed with a plastic sleeve body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having a cutout <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is attached in such a manner as to cover the connecting portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thereby retaining the engagement state of the circular protrusion element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is not essentially required that the tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided to the distal end side of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. It is also accepted that only the peripheral edge portion of the distal end of the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with a tapered surface, or none of the distal end side of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> nor the distal end edge portion of the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with a tapered surface. In the alternative, only the distal end side of the guide rib <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be provided with a tapered surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show a pipe connecting structure <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to another embodiment of the present invention. According to this embodiment, a sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises a sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> extending on opposite sides of an engagement pin (engagement protrusion) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed therebetween, along an outer peripheral surface of a female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and tightly contacting the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a region exceeding a semi-circle, with a gap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> left between opposite ends <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction, and a pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> including a pair of support leg portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a pressing portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> supported at opposite sides thereof by the support leg portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and disposed in such a manner as to retain a space <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) between the pressing portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by connecting distal end portions of the pair of support leg portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to opposite end portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, with the gap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> sandwiched therebetween at a location confronting the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The pressing portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is pressed in a Y-direction towards the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to push out the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> upward at the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> side. By doing so, the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved outward in a radial direction so that an engagement state of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with respect to a male side protrusion engagement hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be released (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to this embodiment, the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> integrally includes an auxiliary sleeve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which is connected to the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in an axial direction X and adapted to cover a seam portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) where the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are overlapped with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is, for example, a resiliently deformable annular member made of synthetic resin (plastics). The sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a configuration formed by integrally connecting the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as a circular portion and the pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> as a circular portion having curvature smaller than that of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. An inside diameter of a circular section of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is coincident with an outside diameter of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> extends in a circumferential direction on opposite sides of a place from where the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projects. That is to say, the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is arranged, in a tightly contacted manner, along the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a region exceeding an arc length which is equal to a semi-circle length plus at least a projection length of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Between the opposite ends <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, an angle region of 180 degrees, preferably between 100 to 140 degrees, is cut out in the circumferential direction such that the gap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is left remained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Owing to the above-mentioned arrangement, the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is resiliently deformed at the time of being pushed out at the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> side upon pressing of the pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. By doing so, the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is slidingly moved in such a manner as to ride along the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> while spreading the gap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so that a central portion where the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projects can be moved outward in a radial direction until the engagement state of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with a male side protrusion engagement hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is released, without making the opposite end portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> fall off the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When the pressure on the pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is released, the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is restored to its original shape by biasing force, for returning the enlarged gap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to its original state and smoothly restoring it to a state, whereas a distal end portion of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projects from an inner peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has such a structure that the pressing portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> located in the circular cross-sectional center of the pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is supported by the opposite support leg portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This makes it possible to form a space <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which retains an interval exceeding at least a projection length of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from an inner peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, between an inner side of the pressing body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to which the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is attached. Upon pressing of the pressing body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, this pressing force is transmitted to the opposite end portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through the support leg portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which are integrally connected to sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, so that the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be pushed out at the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> side. When the pressing portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is pressed until it is brought into intimate contact with the outer peripheral surface of the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the distal end portion of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the male side protrusion engagement hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). This makes it possible to disassemble the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by withdrawing the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary sleeve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> integrally joined with the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has the same cross-sectional configuration as that of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary sleeve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is integrally connected to that end face of the sleeve body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the circular sleeve-like pipe <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> side (the connected portion is shown by a broken line). The auxiliary sleeve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is arranged in such a manner as to cover the overlapping seam portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> forming a stage portion when the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is inserted into the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form the connecting portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. By doing so, the connecting portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> can have a more attractive outer appearance. The auxiliary sleeve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is provided, on that area of its outer peripheral surface which is confronted with the slit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, with a guide belt <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> disposed on an extension of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the axial direction X. By virtue of this arrangement, the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can smoothly be inserted into the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> while correctly positioning the protrusion guide groove <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with respect to the guide belt <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to the connecting structure <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, the pair of circular sleeve-like pipes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can easily be connected integrally in the axial direction X by the following simple operation. The male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is inserted, through the distal end opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, into the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to which the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary sleeve member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> integral with the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are attached and with the distal end portion of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projecting inward from the inner peripheral surface through the female side engagement hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, while correctly positioning them by means of the protrusion guide groove <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the guide belt <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. After the distal end portion of the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is brought into abutment with the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projecting inward as a result of insertion of the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> into the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a guide rib <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rides along the protrusion guide groove <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> while enlarging the diameter of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> slidingly moves along the protrusion guide groove <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. When the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is inserted into the female side end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until a steep gradient portion <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the male side end portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is brought into abutment with an edge portion of the distal end opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the connecting portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed, the male side engagement hoe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the female side engagement hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are aligned with each other and the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pushed down by resilient biasing force of the sleeve member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is enlarged in diameter, so that the engagement pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is lockingly engaged with the male side engagement hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.
